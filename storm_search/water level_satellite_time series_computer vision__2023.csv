Long-Term Water Level Forecasting for El Yeso Reservoir using Time-Series Data and Satellite Images,"This study aims to perform long-term forecasting of monthly water levels from El Yeso Dam, one of the most important water reservoirs in Santiago, Chile. Leveraging a 14-year time-series climate data and satellite imagery, our investigation focuses on understanding the dynamics of water levels and their correlation with environmental factors. Landsat constellation images were extracted using the Google Earth Engine platform to examine the appearance of the dam and calculate the area of the water surface. Several experiments were performed using stochastic time series models such as SARIMAX and Recurrent Neural Networks, including SimpleRNN, LSTM, and GRU. The algorithms were validated through the examination of errors, analysis of performance criteria, and inspection of residuals. According to the results, the reservoir’s volume does not exhibit a sustained downward trend. On the contrary, a slight increase in water level is forecasted during the winter months and a significant rise is anticipated for the summer months. This suggests that the consistent temperature increase in the area due to climate change may contribute to the melting of the snow cover and surrounding glaciers, resulting in an increase in water levels. Therefore, this research contributes to the development of effective planning and management strategies for the region’s water resources.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/906f5cc1bf82fa8a130b72df91bf27262017d1a5,906f5cc1bf82fa8a130b72df91bf27262017d1a5,"Paulette Reyes-Baeza, Roxana Trujillo-Guiñez, Mabel Vidal"
Response of Guobu Slope Displacement to Rainfall and Reser-Voir Water Level with Time-Series InSAR and Wavelet Analysis,"Reservoir bank landslides are a frequent phenomenon, and the stability of these landslides is affected by two essential factors: rainfall and reservoir level changes. Studying the response patterns of reservoir bank landslide movements to these variables is crucial in preventing their occurrence and mitigating their effects. To this end, this study employed 103 European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus Sentinel-1 images and the SBAS-InSAR (small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar) technique to obtain a time series of the Guobu slope deformation from September 2015 to December 2019. The Guobu slope showed significant toppling damage. The satellite line of sight (LOS) detected a maximum subsidence rate of −447 mm/y (the negative sign indicates movement away from the satellite, i.e., subsidence) in the upper section of the slope. Subsequently, three wavelet tools were used to quantitatively analyze the effect of rainfall and reservoir water level on the deformation of the Guobu slope. The results demonstrate a positive correlation between rainfall and the deformation of the Guobu slope. Moreover, the deformation lags behind the rainfall by approximately 70 days. In contrast, the reservoir water level and the deformation of the Guobu slope exhibit an inverse relationship. The deformation of the leading edge of the slope body lags behind the reservoir level by approximately 19 days, while the middle and upper sections of the slope body, which have the most significant rate of variability, lag by about 80 days. Among these factors, rainfall plays a dominant role in the deformation of the Guobu slope, while reservoir levels play a synergistic role. The findings of this study highlight the importance of monitoring and understanding the impact of changes in rainfall and reservoir water levels on the stability of reservoir bank landslides. This understanding is crucial in preventing the occurrence of such landslides and minimizing their impact. The use of remote sensing techniques, together with wavelet analysis, enables the accurate and timely monitoring of the deformation of the Guobu slope, providing valuable insights for disaster warnings and disaster prevention and reduction efforts.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3cd9c25aec9433c69c84aa334da39e9ea55efb25,3cd9c25aec9433c69c84aa334da39e9ea55efb25,"L.

Monitoring of Wheat Crop Growth at Farm Level Using Time Series Multispectral Satellite Imagery,": The monitoring of wheat crop growth plays a crucial role in ensuring effective agricultural management and enhancing food security. Valuable insights into the spatial distribution and various growth stages of wheat crop can be obtained through the combination of multi-spectral remote sensing datasets, data analysis, and ground-truth veriﬁcation. This work aims to monitor wheat crops at farm level in the Bathinda district of India during the agricultural year 2022–23. It involves collecting and analyzing multispectral satellite data over ﬁve selected farmlands in the study region. Preprocessing of the multispectral satellite data is performed, including radiometric and atmospheric corrections. The wheat crops’ health and growth are examined, utilizing various indices such as the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), Normalized Difference Red Edge (NDRE), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) retrieved from time series remote sensing datasets. Furthermore, wheat crop monitoring is performed, using fortnightly data encompassing its health, moisture levels, and growth stages on individual farmlands. Different farmlands have shown varied LSWI, NDRE, and NDVI values. Variations in crop growth and productivity were observed among farmlands due to differences in soil properties and sowing dates. The ﬁndings from this study offer valuable insights into the importance of timely sowing, crop health monitoring, irrigation management, and soil suitability in optimizing wheat crop production.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d69ec2d1c8afcb23f490b0f3e4fc9ee6384a83a6,d69ec2d1c8afcb23f490b0f3e4fc9ee6384a83a6,"Baljit Singh, Bhavya Chauhan, Sandeep Kumar Kaushik, Varun Narayan Mishra"
Densifying and Optimizing the Water Level Series for Large Lakes from Multi-Orbit ICESat-2 Observations,"Satellite laser altimetry has been widely used for monitoring surface height changes in inland waters. However, constructing time series of water levels is partially limited in temporal resolution only based on the individual orbit of altimeter observations. To densify and optimize the time series of altimetry-based water levels is crucial to the scientific understanding of lake hydrologic dynamics. This paper focuses on synthesizing the multi-orbit on-lake observations from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) to densify and refine the water level time series for large lakes. The approach of synthesizing water level time series has been validated through experiments applied to 18 large lakes worldwide, resulting in an average R of 0.93, RMSE of 0.14 m, MAE of 0.12 m, NSE of 0.67, and CV of 2.86, according to the hydrologic gauge stations. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can provide an effective solution for densifying the water level series of large lakes covered by multi-orbit ICESat-2 observations. Further, the approach can be extended to monitor the high-frequency variation of other lakes covered by the multiple ICESat-2 orbits. This approach provides the potential of generating higher-frequency estimates of water levels based on satellite altimetry, which could not only help to reveal the characteristics of the seasonal dynamics of lakes but also be used to investigate the abrupt water level changes due to hydrological extreme events (e.g., floods, droughts, etc.).",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6fd820bd2eb31c2906f5a260df523a502652e63a,6fd820bd2eb31c2906f5a260df523a502652e63a,"Tan Chen, Chunqiao Song, Pengfei Zhan, Chenyu Fan"
