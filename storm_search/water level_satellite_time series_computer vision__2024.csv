Recovery of Time Series of Water Volume in Lake Ranco (South Chile) through Satellite Altimetry and Its Relationship with Climatic Phenomena,"In the context of escalating climate change-induced impacts on water resources, robust monitoring tools are imperative. Satellite altimetry, benefiting from technical improvement such as the use of SAR and InSAR techniques and tracking modes considering topography, is emerging as a crucial means of estimating lake levels, data that are fundamental to understanding climate dynamics. This study delves into the use of satellite-altimetry-determined water levels to analyze changes in water storage and superficial area in Lake Ranco, in south-central Chile, from 1995 to 2023. The main objective is to provide valuable information for water-resource management and policy formulation. Leveraging AlTiS software (v2.2.9-0-gf5938ab), radar-altimetry data from the missions ERS-2, ENVISAT, SARAL, and Sentinel-3A were processed, generating a complete time series of water levels. The lake-level data were complemented by the bathymetric data for the lake to obtain the variation in the area and volume in the period 1995–2023. These results were analyzed with respect to hydrometeorological data from the study area, such as precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, and potential evapotranspiration. Additionally, the effects of ENSO (ENSO 3.4 index) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDO) were considered. Results reveal a strong correlation between altimetry-derived lake levels and observed in situ data, with a mean square error of 0.04 m, a coefficient of determination of 0.99, an index of agreement of 0.99, and a Kling−Gupta efficiency of 0.90. The analysis of climatic variables showed that variations in lake level coincide with changes in precipitation within the study area and also showed the influence of variations in temperature and potential evapotranspiration. Additionally, the effects of the ENSO phenomenon can be seen within the study area for its cold phase (i.e., La Niña) in the 2010–2012 period and for its warm phase (i.e., El Niño) in the 2015–2016 period, with a decrease and increase in precipitation, respectively. These effects were enhanced when the cold and warm phases of the ENSO and PDO phenomena occured. The successful application of satellite altimetry demonstrated in this study underscores its critical role in advancing our understanding and management of water resources amidst changing climate scenarios.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e331d6f0dc886ad80d14053bf5cd4ef346498b93,e331d6f0dc886ad80d14053bf5cd4ef346498b93,"Patricio Fuentes-Aguilera, Lien Rodríguez-López, L.

Inland Water Level Monitoring from Satellite Observations: A Scoping Review of Current Advances and Future Opportunities,"Inland water level and its dynamics are key components in the global water cycle and land surface hydrology, significantly influencing climate variability and water resource management. Satellite observations, in particular altimetry missions, provide inland water level time series for nearly three decades. Space-based remote sensing is regarded as a cost-effective technique that provides measurements of global coverage and homogeneous accuracy in contrast to in-situ sensors. The advent of Open-Loop Tracking Command (OLTC), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode strengthened the use of altimetry missions for inland water level monitoring. However, it is still very challenging to obtain accurate measurements of water level over narrow rivers and small lakes. This scoping systematic literature review summarizes and disseminates the research findings, highlights major results, and presents the limitations regarding inland water level monitoring from satellite observations between 2018 and 2022. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline and through a double screening process, 48 scientific publications were selected meeting the eligibility criteria. To summarize the achievements of the previous 5 years, we present fundamental statistical results of the publications, such as the annual number of publications, scientific journals, keywords, and study regions per continent and type of inland water body. Also, publications associated with specific satellite missions were analyzed. The findings show that Sentinel-3 is the dominant satellite mission, while the ICESat-2 laser altimetry mission has exhibited a high growth trend. Furthermore, publications including radar altimetry missions were charted based on the retracking algorithms, presenting the novel and improved methods of the last five years. Moreover, this review confirms that there is a lack of research on the collaboration of altimetry data with machine learning techniques.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d5a1249a97919e5d6e5a10dafa9efd3bd77f1e86,d5a1249a97919e5d6e5a10dafa9efd3bd77f1e86,"S.

"Time Series Analysis of Water Quality Factors Enhancing Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs): A Study Integrating In-Situ and Satellite Data, Vaal Dam, South Africa","The Vaal Dam catchment, which is the source of potable water for Gauteng province, is characterized by diverse human activities, and the dam encounters significant nutrient input from multiple sources within its catchment. As a result, there has been a rise in Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) within the reservoir of the dam. In this study, we employed time series analysis on nutrient data to explore the relationship between HABs, using chlorophyll-a (Chl−a) as a proxy, and nutrient levels. Additionally, Chl−a data extracted from Landsat-8 satellite images was utilized to visualize the spatial distribution of HABs in the reservoir. Our findings revealed that HAB productivity in the Vaal Dam is influenced by the levels of total phosphorus (TP) and organic nitrogen (KJEL_N), which exhibited a positive correlation with chlorophyll-a (Chl−a) concentration. Long-term analysis of Chl−a in-situ data (1986–2022) collected at a specific point within the reservoir showed an average concentration of 11.25 μg/L. However, on certain stochastic dates, Chl−a concentration spiked to very high values, reaching a maximum of 452.8 μg/L, coinciding with elevated records of TP and KJEL_N concentrations on those dates, indicating their effect on productivity levels. The decadal time series and trend analysis demonstrated an increasing trend in Chl−a productivity over the studied period, rising from 4.75 μg/L in the first decade (1990–2000) to 10.51 μg/L in the second decade (2000–2010), and reaching 16.7 μg/L in the last decade (2010–2020). The rising averages of the decadal values were associated with increasing decadal averages of its driving factors, TP from 0.1043 to 0.1096 to 0.1119 mg/L for the three decades, respectively, and KJEL_N from 0.80 mg/L in the first decade to 1.14 mg/L in the last decade. Satellite data analysis during the last decade revealed that the spatial dynamics of HABs are influenced by the dam’s geometry and the levels of discharge from its two feeding rivers, with higher concentrations observed in meandering areas of the reservoir and within zones of restricted water circulation.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b5c8e29afc984e6316121ce8dcf2b1cf82405d6,4b5c8e29afc984e6316121ce8dcf2b1cf82405d6,"Altayeb A.

A Multi-Sensor Approach to Characterize Winter Water-Level Drawdown Patterns in Lakes,"Artificial manipulation of lake water levels through practices like winter water-level drawdown (WD) is prevalent across many regions, but the spatiotemporal patterns are not well documented due to limited in situ monitoring. Multi-sensor satellite remote sensing provides an opportunity to map and analyze drawdown frequency and metrics (timing, magnitude, duration) at broad scales. This study developed a cloud computing framework to process time series of synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel 1-SAR) and optical sensor (Landsat 8, Sentinel 2) data to characterize WD in 166 lakes across Massachusetts, USA, during 2016–2021. Comparisons with in situ logger data showed that the Sentinel 1-derived surface water area captured relative water-level fluctuations indicative of WD. A machine learning approach classified lakes as WD versus non-WD based on seasonal water-level fluctuations derived from Sentinel 1-SAR data. The framework mapped WD lakes statewide, revealing prevalence throughout Massachusetts with interannual variability. Results showed WDs occurred in over 75% of lakes during the study period, with high interannual variability in the number of lakes conducting WD. Mean WD magnitude was highest in the wettest year (2018) but % lake area exposure did not show any association with precipitation and varied between 8% to 12% over the 5-year period. WD start date was later and duration was longer in wet years, indicating climate mediation of WD implementation driven by management decisions. The data and tools developed provide an objective information resource to evaluate ecological impacts and guide management of this prevalent but understudied phenomenon. Overall, the results and interactive web tool developed as part of this study provide new hydrologic intelligence to inform water management and policies related to WD practices.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dfa93c49495d114fcf6afc8e17d605dddde2b513,dfa93c49495d114fcf6afc8e17d605dddde2b513,"Abhishek Kumar, Allison H.
