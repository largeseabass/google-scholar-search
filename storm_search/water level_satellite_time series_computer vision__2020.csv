Long Term Aquatic Vegetation Dynamics in Longgan Lake Using Landsat Time Series and Their Responses to Water Level Fluctuation,"Aquatic vegetation in shallow freshwater lakes are severely degraded worldwide, even though they are essential for inland ecosystem services. Detailed information about the long term variability of aquatic plants can help investigate the potential driving mechanisms and help mitigate the degradation. In this paper, based on Google Earth Engine cloud-computing platform, we made use of a 33-year (1987–2019) retrospective archive of moderate resolution Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI satellite images to estimate the extent changes in aquatic vegetation in Longgan Lake from Middle Yangtze River Basin in China using the modified enhanced vegetation index, including emerged, floating-leaved and floating macrophytes. The analysis of the long term dynamics of aquatic vegetation showed that aquatic vegetation were mainly distributed in the western part of the lake, where lake bottom elevation ranged from 11 to 12 m, with average water depth of less than 1 m in spring. The vegetation area variation for the 33-year period were divided into six stages. In years with heavy precipitation, the vegetation area decreased sharply. In the following years, the area normally restored. Aquatic vegetation area had a significant negative correlation with the spring water level and summer water level. The results showed that aquatic vegetation was negatively affected when water depth exceeded 2.5 m in May and 5 m in summer. It is recommended that water depth remain close to 1 m in spring and close to 3 m in summer for aquatic vegetation growth. Our study provide quantitative evidence that water-level fluctuations drive vegetation changes in Longgan Lake, and present a basis for sustainable lake restoration and management.",2020,11,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/224e94b452bbd61fdcfb856056162aff61ac586e,224e94b452bbd61fdcfb856056162aff61ac586e,"Wenxia Tan, Jindi Xing, Shao Yang, Gongliang Yu, Panpan Sun, Yan Jiang"
Validation of ICESat-2 Surface Water Level Product ATL13 with Near Real Time Gauge Data,"The NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) mission uses laser altimetry measurements to determine the elevations at point levels of Earth. ICESat-2, which is a successor to the ICESat-1 satellite mission is a continuation of this series and carries a sensor namely Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS). The key advancement of ICESat-2 is that it generates individual laser foot prints of nearly 14 m (in diameter) on the Earth’s surface, with each footprint separated by only 70 cm, a much higher resolution and sampling than the earlier mission. ATLAS works under the concept of multi-beam approach containing three pairs of strong and weak beams that produce data products containing global geolocated photon data and height data from land-ice, sea-ice, land/terrain, canopy, ocean surface, and inland water-bodies. From the Level 2 master product called ATL03 numerous sub-data product are generated and are made available to the public through the National Snow and Ice Data Center. One of the products namely ATL13 is a specialized geophysical data product that gives along-track and near-shore water surface height distribution within the water masks. In this article, results after validating ATL13 data product with 46 observations made with near real-time gauged data for 15 reservoirs/water bodies have been presented. The maximum uncertainty observed for this data product is at centimeter-level. A significant observation made from this study is that the heights of surface water level computed from strong beams (gt1r, gt2r, and gt3r) and weak beams (gt1l, gt2l, and gt3l) are occasionally having a variation of 5 to 10 centimeters relatively.",2020,15,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c1770f3a69a65382369e6b96976a778947452225,c1770f3a69a65382369e6b96976a778947452225,"G.

Large-Scale Precise Mapping of Agricultural Fields in Sentinel-2 Satellite Image Time Series,"This paper presents an approach for large-scale precise mapping of agricultural fields based on the analysis of Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) acquired by ESA Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite constellation. The approach has been developed in the framework of the ESA SEOM - Scientific Exploitation of Operational Missions - S2-4Sci Land and Water project. The goal is to design a flexible and automatic processing chain able to perform mapping in massive data. Here we focus on precision agriculture products generation at country level. In particular, the Country of study is Italy and the application goal is precision agriculture of single crop fields. To achieve this goal, two macro challenges are considered: (i) download and pre-processing of S2 SITS, and (ii) multi-temporal (MT) fine characterization of agricultural fields. Both challenges are addressed in an automatic way by exploiting and/or updating state-of-the-art methodologies. Promising results have been obtained over years 2017 and 2018 for Italy.",2020,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc8a36ef1435b660d6da287c4467ff6fe325caec,dc8a36ef1435b660d6da287c4467ff6fe325caec,"Yady Tatiana Solano Correa, Daniel Carcereri, F.

Defining a retracking manifold within a radargram stack to improve satellite altimetric water level over coastal seas: A feasibility study,"
 <p>Single-waveform retracking for satellite altimetry applications over coastal zones has reached its limits, obtaining decimeter-level accuracy. The existing retracking methods find a retracker offset in a waveform by analyzing the variation in backscattered power along the bin coordinate. This makes the retracking procedure strongly dependent on noise in backscattered power. Moreover, the success of such methods is only guaranteed for certain waveform types requiring cumbersome pre-processing steps including waveform classification.&#160;</p><p>With the launch of the operational Sentinel-3 series of the European Copernicus programme, the algorithms to obtain highly precise water level estimates over inland waters and coastal seas need to become more robust, efficient and fit for automated use. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to demonstrate the potential of developing a next-level retracking algorithm and, consequently, improve altimetric water level determination over coastal regions. To this end, neighboring waveforms are collected into a (single-pass) radargram and, then, such radargrams are stacked over time. These so-called (multi-pass) radargram stacks contain, unlike single waveforms, the full information on spatio-temporal variation of backscattered power over water surfaces.</p><p>The radargram stack eases the recognition of patterns like retracking gate, shoreline, tides, etc. Instead of a retracking gate as a point in the 1D waveform, in a 3D radargram stack a surface referred to as retracking manifold is to be determined.</p><p>The potential of our new approach will be demonstrated using Sentinel 3B data, pass number 655, over the Cuxhaven tide gauge station at the Wadden Sea.</p><p>The idea of waveform retracking by analyzing its spatio-temporal behavior in a 3D data structure opens new pathways for achieving robust and more accurate water level estimates from operational missions, e.g. Sentinel 3, and from future missions, e.g. SWOT, over inland waters and coastal seas.</p>

Using Satellite Thermal-Based Evapotranspiration Time Series for Defining Management Zones and Spatial Association to Local Attributes in a Vineyard,"A well-planned irrigation management strategy is crucial for successful wine grape production and is highly dependent on accurate assessments of water stress. Precision irrigation practices may benefit from the quantification of within-field spatial variability and temporal patterns of evapotranspiration (ET). A spatiotemporal modeling framework is proposed to delineate the vineyard into homogeneous areas (i.e., management zones) according to their ET patterns. The dataset for this study relied on ET retrievals from multiple satellite platforms, generating estimates at high spatial (30 m) and temporal (daily) resolutions for a Vitis vinifera Pinot noir vineyard in the Central Valley of California during the growing seasons of 2015-2018. Time-series decomposition was used to deconstruct the time series of each pixel into three components: long-term trend, seasonality, and remainder, which indicates daily fluctuations. For each time-series component, a time-series clustering (TSC) algorithm was applied to partition the time series of all pixels into homogeneous groups and generate TSC maps. The TSC maps were compared for spatial similarities using the V-measure statistic. A random forest (RF) classification algorithm was used for each TSC map against six environmental variables (elevation, slope, northness, lithology, topographic wetness index, and soil type) to check for spatial association between ET-TSC maps and the local characteristics in the vineyard. Finally, the TSC maps were used as independent variables against yield (ton ha-1) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess whether the TSC maps explained yield variability. The trend and seasonality TSC maps had a moderate spatial association (V = 0.49), while the remainder showed dissimilar spatial patterns to seasonality and trend. The RF model showed high error matrix-based prediction accuracy levels ranging between 86% and 90%. For the trend and seasonality models, the most important predictor was soil type, followed by elevation, while the remainder TSC was strongly linked with northness spatial variability. The yield levels corresponding to the two clusters in all TSC were significantly different. These findings enabled spatial quantification of ET time series at different temporal scales that may benefit within-season decision-making regarding the amounts, timing, intervals, and location of irrigation. The proposed framework may be applicable to other cases in both agricultural systems and environmental modeling.",2020,12,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08e8e8ed79433d6030ddfd56421e5c7c940d012a,08e8e8ed79433d6030ddfd56421e5c7c940d012a,"N.
