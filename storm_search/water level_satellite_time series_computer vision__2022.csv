ICESat‐2 Based River Surface Slope and Its Impact on Water Level Time Series From Satellite Altimetry,"The water surface slope (WSS) of rivers is essential for estimating flow velocity and discharge. It is also helpful as a correction applied to range measurements of satellite altimetry missions to derive water level time series at a virtual station. Using radar altimetry, WSS can only be roughly estimated and is limited to wide rivers because of its coarse spatiotemporal resolution. In contrast, the lidar sensor onboard Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat‐2) can also observe small rivers. Using ICESat‐2's unique measurement geometry with six parallel laser beams, we derive instantaneous WSS along and across the satellite's ground track, time‐variable WSS (with an average of 5 days of records in the studied epoch between October 2018 and October 2021), and average WSS on reach‐scale. Although the method can be applied globally, this study is limited to 815 reaches in Europe and North America where sufficient validation data is available. We compare the ICESat‐2 WSS with time‐variable WSS derived from multiple gauges and constant data from the “SWOT River Database.” For 89% of the studied reaches, ICESat‐2 can be used to estimate the average WSS with a median absolute error of 23 mm/km. We also show the possible performance gain at multiple virtual stations (VS) in the “Database for Hydrological Time Series of Inland Waters” (https://dahiti.dgfi.tum.de), applying the WSS as a correction for altimetry satellites' ground track variability. We correct 137 VS for the derived ICESat‐2 WSS and yield improvements in the root mean square error by up to 30 cm or 66%.",2022,11,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6836b03047358b5077488d23a4892c1613a3721d,6836b03047358b5077488d23a4892c1613a3721d,"D.

Water Body Mapping Using Long Time Series Sentinel-1 SAR Data in Poyang Lake,"Mapping water bodies with a high accuracy is necessary for water resource assessment, and mapping them rapidly is necessary for flood monitoring. Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China, and its wetland is one of the most important in the world. Poyang Lake is affected by floods from the Yangtze River basin every year, and the fluctuation of the water area and water level directly or indirectly affects the ecological environment of Poyang Lake. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is particularly suitable for large-scale water body mapping, as SAR allows data acquisition regardless of illumination and weather conditions. The two-satellite Sentinel-1 constellation, providing C-Band SAR data, passes over the Poyang Lake about five times a month. With its high temporal-spatial resolution, the Sentinel-1 SAR data can be used to accurately monitor the water body. After acquiring all the Sentinel-1 (1A and 1B) SAR data, to ensure the consistency of data processing, we propose the use of a Python and SeNtinel Application Platform (SNAP)-based engine (SARProcMod) to process the data and construct a Poyang Lake Sentinel-1 SAR dataset with a 10 m resolution. To extract water body information from Sentinel-1 SAR data, we propose an automatic classification engine based on a modified U-Net convolutional neural network (WaterUNet), which classifies all data using artificial sample datasets with a high validation accuracy. The results show that the maximum and minimum water areas in our study area were 2714.08 km2 on 20 July 2020, and 634.44 km2 on 4 January 2020. Compared to the water level data from the Poyang gauging station, the water area was highly correlated with the water level, with the correlation coefficient being up to 0.92 and the R2 from quadratic polynomial fitting up to 0.88; thus, the resulting relationship results can be used to estimate the water area or water level of Poyang Lake. According to the results, we can conclude that Sentinel-1 SAR and WaterUNet are very suitable for water body monitoring as well as emergency flood mapping.",2022,14,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/56426204254238aee0ab1b782085c21a1e62019f,56426204254238aee0ab1b782085c21a1e62019f,"G.

Efficient data-driven gap filling of satellite image time series using deep neural networks with partial convolutions,"
The abundance of gaps in satellite image time series often complicates the application of deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks for spatiotemporal modeling. Based on previous work in computer vision on image inpainting, this paper shows how three-dimensional spatiotemporal partial convolutions can be used as layers in neural networks to fill gaps in satellite image time series. To evaluate the approach, we apply a U-Net-like model on incomplete image time series of quasi-global carbon monoxide observations from the Sentinel-5P satellite. Prediction errors were comparable to two considered statistical approaches while computation times for predictions were up to three orders of magnitude faster, making the approach applicable to process large amounts of satellite data. Partial convolutions can be added as layers to other types of neural networks, making it relatively easy to integrate with existing deep learning models. However, the approach does not provide prediction uncertainties and further research is needed to understand and improve model transferability. The implementation of spatiotemporal partial convolutions and the U-Net-like model is available as open-source software.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c9cda15d615c1a726c391228600e4227af8d5214,c9cda15d615c1a726c391228600e4227af8d5214,M.

Spatiotemporal variations of water quality in Baiyangdian Lake in past 37 years based on Landsat time series images,"Based on 116-phase Landsat satellite remote sensing data between 1984 and 2021, this paper inverted the long-term distribution of water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen (DO), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) of the water in Baiyangdian Lake, and analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and variations of water quality in Baiyangdian Lake over 37 years. In terms of temporal scale, the inter-annual variation of DO shows certain stability, and the images with the proportion of pollution-free area reaching 90% or more account for 88.7% of the total, showing no pollution in terms of DO; In terms of ORP, the images with the proportion of pollution-free area reaching 90% or more account for 81.2% of the total, showing no pollution to light pollution; the inter-annual variation of Chl-a concentration shows certain volatility, and the overall performance is light-moderate pollution, but the pollution level has been alleviated in recent years; the pollution status of water quality in Baiyangdian Lake in terms of Chl-a and ORP has a certain correlation. In terms of spatial scale, the spatial distribution pattern of DO and ORP is stable, presenting the characteristic that most areas are pollution-free, and a few areas with more frequent human activities show light and moderate pollution.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96c30a5ef37b323c4b848fbf21606f0ddcae58df,96c30a5ef37b323c4b848fbf21606f0ddcae58df,"Minghua Cheng, Miao Jiang, Zhaoqiang Huang, H.

Monitoring and Analysis of Water Level–Water Storage Capacity Changes in Ngoring Lake Based on Multisource Remote Sensing Data,"Mastering the fluctuation of water levels and the water storage capacity of plateau lakes is greatly important for monitoring the water balance of the Tibetan Plateau and predicting regional and global climate change. The water level of plateau lakes is difficult to measure, and the ground measured data of long-time series are difficult to obtain. Ngoring Lake is considered in this study, using spaceborne single-photon lidar ICESat-2/ATL13 inland lake standard data products, the water level values provided by Hydroweb laboratory, and the image data of an optical remote sensing satellite. A new method is proposed in the absence of measured data. The method uses multisource remote sensing data to estimate the long-term changes in the water levels, surface area, and water storage capacity of Ngoring Lake in the past three decades. The results show that the water level values of ICESat-2 and Hydroweb on overlapping observation days are highly correlated, with R2 = 0.9776, MAE = 0.420 m, RMSE = 0.077 m, and the average absolute height difference is 0.049 m. The fusion of multiple altimetry data can obtain more continuous long-time series water-level observation results. From 1992 to 2021, the water body information of Ngoring Lake basin fluctuated greatly and showed different variation characteristics in different time periods. The lowest water level in January 1997 was approximately 4268.49 m, and it rose to its highest in October 2009, approximately 4272.44 m. The change in the water level in the basin was mainly affected by natural factors, such as precipitation, air temperature, and human activities. The analysis shows that ICESat-2 can be combined with other remote sensing data to realize the long-time series dynamic monitoring of plateau lakes, showing great advantages in the comprehensive observation of plateau lakes in no man’s land.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8840ce4b1a2be14baa3f07377463629d1c2f0a2d,8840ce4b1a2be14baa3f07377463629d1c2f0a2d,"W.
