Assessing macrophyte seasonal dynamics using dense time series of medium resolution satellite data,"Thanks to the improved spatial and temporal resolution of new generation Earth Observation missions, such as Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, the potential of remote sensing techniques in mapping land surface phenology of terrestrial biomes can now be tested in inland water systems. We assessed the capabilities of dense time series of medium resolution satellite data to deliver quantitative information about macrophyte phenology metrics, focusing on three temperate European shallow lakes with connected wetlands, located in Italy, France and Romania. Leaf area index (LAI) maps for floating and emergent macrophyte growth forms were derived from semi-empirical regression modelling based on the best performing spectral index, with an error level around 0.11 m2 m-2. Phenology metrics were computed from LAI time series using TIMESAT code and used to analyse macrophyte seasonal dynamics in terms of spatial patterns and species-dependent variability. Peculiar patterns of autochthonous and allochthonous species seasonality across the three study areas were related to the environmental characteristics of each area in terms of ecological and hydrological conditions. In addition, the influence of satellite dataset characteristics – i.e. cloud cover thresholding, temporal resolution and missing acquisitions – on phenology timing metrics retrieval was assessed. Results have shown that with full resolution (5-day revisit) time series, cloud cover can bias phenology timing metrics by less than 2 days, and that reducing temporal resolution to 15 days (similar to Landsat revisit) still allows for mapping the start and peak of macrophyte growth with an error level around 2–3 days.",2018,38,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1136d55fe1c54f2bae6a3edb0f2f1ad90991a639,1136d55fe1c54f2bae6a3edb0f2f1ad90991a639,"P.

Using Time Series of High-Resolution Planet Satellite Images to Monitor Grapevine Stem Water Potential in Commercial Vineyards,"Spectral-based vegetation indices (VI) have been shown to be good proxies of grapevine stem water potential (Ψstem), assisting in irrigation decision-making for commercial vineyards. However, VI-Ψstem correlations are mostly reported at the leaf or canopy scales, using proximal canopy-based sensors or very-high-spatial resolution images derived from sensors mounted on small airplanes or drones. Here, for the first time, we take advantage of high-spatial resolution (3-m) near-daily images acquired from Planet’s nano-satellite constellation to derive VI-Ψstem correlations at the vineyard scale. Weekly Ψstem was measured along the growing season of 2017 in six vines each in 81 commercial vineyards and in 60 pairs of grapevines in a 2.4 ha experimental vineyard in Israel. The Clip application programming interface (API), provided by Planet, and the Google Earth Engine platform were used to derive spatially continuous time series of four VIs—GNDVI, NDVI, EVI and SAVI—in the 82 vineyards. Results show that per-week multivariable linear models using variables extracted from VI time series successfully tracked spatial variations in Ψstem across the experimental vineyard (Pearson’s-r = 0.45–0.84; N = 60). A simple linear regression model enabled monitoring seasonal changes in Ψstem along the growing season in the vineyard (r = 0.80–0.82). Planet VIs and seasonal Ψstem data from the 82 vineyards were used to derive a ‘global’ model for in-season monitoring of Ψstem at the vineyard-level (r = 0.78; RMSE = 18.5%; N = 970). The ‘global’ model, which requires only a few VI variables extracted from Planet images, may be used for real-time weekly assessment of Ψstem in Mediterranean vineyards, substantially improving the efficiency of conventional in-field monitoring efforts.",2018,59,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8c4c4ef01f69c10f0d81f32bb17031dd6e10c96,a8c4c4ef01f69c10f0d81f32bb17031dd6e10c96,"D.
