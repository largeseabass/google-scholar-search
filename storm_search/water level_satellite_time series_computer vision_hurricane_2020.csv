Can GNSS-R Detect Abrupt Water Level Changes?,"Global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) uses signals of opportunity in a bi-static configuration of L-band microwave radar to retrieve environmental variables such as water level. The line-of-sight signal and its coherent surface reflection signal are not separate observables in geodetic GNSS-R. The temporally constructive and destructive oscillations in the recorded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observations can be used to retrieve water-surface levels at intermediate spatial scales that are proportional to the height of the GNSS antenna above the water surface. In this contribution, SNR observations are used to retrieve water levels at the Vianden Pumped Storage Plant (VPSP) in Luxembourg, where the water-surface level abruptly changes up to 17 m every 4-8 h to generate a peak current when the energy demand increases. The GNSS-R water level retrievals are corrected for the vertical velocity and acceleration of the water surface. The vertical velocity and acceleration corrections are important corrections that mitigate systematic errors in the estimated water level, especially for VPSP with such large water-surface changes. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the 10-min multi-GNSS water level time series and water level gauge records is 7.0 cm for a one-year period, with a 0.999 correlation coefficient. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-R can be used as a new complementary approach to study hurricanes or storm surges that cause abnormal rises of water levels.",2020,10,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/68c56c4f5311411df786b30eeee6b0000b53f78f,68c56c4f5311411df786b30eeee6b0000b53f78f,"S.

Quantifying the Effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria on Coastal Water Quality in Puerto Rico using Moderate Resolution Satellite Sensors,"Coastal, benthic communities, such as coral reefs, are at particular risk due to poor water quality caused by hurricanes. In addition to the physical impacts from wave action and storm surge, hurricanes bring significant rainfall resulting in increased runoff from land. Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused record or near-record floods at many locations across Puerto Rico and resulted in major impacts on coastal and benthic ecosystems from heavy rainfall and river discharge. In this study, we use imagery from the moderate resolution Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite to quantify the impacts of hurricanes Irma and Maria, which struck Puerto Rico during September 2017, on the water quality of the coastal waters of Puerto Rico using the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (Kd490) products. The objectives include: (1) quantify the water quality and light attenuation after the hurricanes; (2) compare this event to the climatology of these parameters, and 3) evaluate long-term exposure and exceedances of various coastal areas to low levels of turbidity. The Chl-a inner shelf values increased in 2017 during the months of June (8% above baseline), July (17%), August (5%), September (8%), October (19%), and November (28%) when compared to 2012–2016 baseline data. The values for Chl-a concentration reached and exceeded 0.45 µg/L by August 2017 and persisted above that value until December 2017. The Kd490 inner shelf values for 2017 increased (in percent) for the months of June (4% above baseline), July (9%), August (10%), September (5%), October (12%), and November (7%) when compared to 2012–2016 baseline data. The values of Kd490 in August, September, and December 2017 were the highest seen during 2012–2017. Even with the limitations of spatial resolution and loss of data to cloud cover, the 6-year imagery time-series analysis can provide a useful evaluation of the effects of these two hurricanes on the coastal water quality in Puerto Rico, and quantify the exposure of benthic habitats to higher nutrient and turbidity levels.",2020,14,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b3b48e8104824cc6800a9f5345240bb1a47aa60,8b3b48e8104824cc6800a9f5345240bb1a47aa60,"William J.

"Advances in Remote Sensing Technology, Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Marine Oil Spill Detection, Prediction and Vulnerability Assessment","Although advancements in remote sensing technology have facilitated quick capture and identification of the source and location of oil spills in water bodies, the presence of other biogenic elements (lookalikes) with similar visual attributes hinder rapid detection and prompt decision making for emergency response. To date, different methods have been applied to distinguish oil spills from lookalikes with limited success. In addition, accurately modeling the trajectory of oil spills remains a challenge. Thus, we aim to provide further insights on the multi-faceted problem by undertaking a holistic review of past and current approaches to marine oil spill disaster reduction as well as explore the potentials of emerging digital trends in minimizing oil spill hazards. The scope of previous reviews is extended by covering the inter-related dimensions of detection, discrimination, and trajectory prediction of oil spills for vulnerability assessment. Findings show that both optical and microwave airborne and satellite remote sensors are used for oil spill monitoring with microwave sensors being more widely used due to their ability to operate under any weather condition. However, the accuracy of both sensors is affected by the presence of biogenic elements, leading to false positive depiction of oil spills. Statistical image segmentation has been widely used to discriminate lookalikes from oil spills with varying levels of accuracy but the emergence of digitalization technologies in the fourth industrial revolution (IR 4.0) is enabling the use of Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, which are more promising than the statistical methods. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are the most used machine learning algorithms for oil spill detection, although the restriction of ML models to feed forward image classification without support for the end-to-end trainable framework limits its accuracy. On the other hand, deep learning models’ strong feature extraction and autonomous learning capability enhance their detection accuracy. Also, mathematical models based on lagrangian method have improved oil spill trajectory prediction with higher real time accuracy than the conventional worst case, average and survey-based approaches. However, these newer models are unable to quantify oil droplets and uncertainty in vulnerability prediction. Considering that there is yet no single best remote sensing technique for unambiguous detection and discrimination of oil spills and lookalikes, it is imperative to advance research in the field in order to improve existing technology and develop specialized sensors for accurate oil spill detection and enhanced classification, leveraging emerging geospatial computer vision initiatives.",2020,60,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9bea5ff9c6ce0ebde1d6f35c6e9bf8beeb5e7722,9bea5ff9c6ce0ebde1d6f35c6e9bf8beeb5e7722,"S.

Close-range sensing and object-based analysis of shallow landslides and erosion in grasslands,"
 <p>Close-range sensing methods for topographic data acquisition, such as Structure-from-Motion with multi-view stereo (SfM-MVS) photogrammetry and laser scanning from the ground or from unmanned aerial systems (UAS), have strongly improved over the last decade. As they are providing data with sub-decimetre resolution and accuracy, these methods open new possibilities for bridging the gap between local in-situ observations and area-wide space-borne or aerial remote sensing. For assessments of shallow landslides and erosion patches, which are wide-spread phenomena in mountain grasslands, the potential of close-range sensing is two-fold: Firstly, it could provide accurate reference data for assessing the geometric accuracy of a catchment or regional scale eroded area monitoring based on aerial or satellite remote sensing systems. Secondly, selected sites can be monitored at a very detailed local scale to reveal processes of secondary erosion or natural vegetation succession and slope stabilisation. Furthermore, high-resolution 4D data from multi-temporal close-range sensing make it possible to quantify volumes and rates of displacement at erosion features. In this contribution, we propose to exploit this potential of close-range sensing for landslide and erosion studies with object-based approaches for raster and 3D point cloud analyses. Assuming that erosion features can be discriminated from undisturbed grassland and from trees and shrubs, based on their morphometric and spectral signatures, we show how computer vision and machine learning techniques help to detect and label these features automatically as spatial objects in the data. We combine this object detection and labelling with 2.5D differential elevation models and with 3D deformation analysis of point clouds. This strategy addresses one of the key challenges of automatically analysing close-range sensing data in geomorphological studies, i.e. linking geometric information (such as the size and shape of erosion features or the surface change across a time series) with semantic information (e.g. separating vegetation from complex ground structures). In three case studies from recent projects in the Alps, where we acquired data by UAS, terrestrial laser scanning and terrestrial photogrammetry, we demonstrate the use of these new methodological developments. The methods tested can reliably detect changes with minimum magnitudes of centimetre to decimetre level, depending primarily on the specific data acquisition setup. By automatically relating these changes to erosion features of different scales (i.e. both at entire eroded areas and at their components, e.g. collapsing parts of the scarp), such analyses can provide valuable insights regarding process dynamics. In our tests, close-range sensing and automated data analysis workflows helped to understand both the development of new eroded areas as well as their enlargement by secondary erosion processes or episodic landslide reactivation. Based on the experience from these case studies, we also discuss the main challenges and limitations of these methods for erosion monitoring applications.</p>
