Causal inference for climate change events from satellite image time series using computer vision and deep learning,"We propose a method for causal inference using satellite image time series, in order to determine the treatment effects of interventions which impact climate change, such as deforestation. Simply put, the aim is to quantify the 'before versus after' effect of climate related human driven interventions, such as urbanization; as well as natural disasters, such as hurricanes and forest fires. As a concrete example, we focus on quantifying forest tree cover change/ deforestation due to human led causes. The proposed method involves the following steps. First, we use computer vision and machine learning/deep learning techniques to detect and quantify forest tree coverage levels over time, at every time epoch. We then look at this time series to identify changepoints. Next, we estimate the expected (forest tree cover) values using a Bayesian structural causal model and projecting/forecasting the counterfactual. This is compared to the values actually observed post intervention, and the difference in the two values gives us the effect of the intervention (as compared to the non intervention scenario, i.e. what would have possibly happened without the intervention). As a specific use case, we analyze deforestation levels before and after the hyperinflation event (intervention) in Brazil (which ended in 1993-94), for the Amazon rainforest region, around Rondonia, Brazil. For this deforestation use case, using our causal inference framework can help causally attribute change/reduction in forest tree cover and increasing deforestation rates due to human activities at various points in time.",2019,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/024cc6018139369cfc9eecf76738418725ff5c2e,024cc6018139369cfc9eecf76738418725ff5c2e,V.

Land Cover Maps Production with High Resolution Satellite Image Time Series and Convolutional Neural Networks: Adaptations and Limits for Operational Systems,"The Sentinel-2 satellite mission offers high resolution multispectral time-series image data, enabling the production of detailed land cover maps globally. When mapping large territories, the trade-off between processing time and result quality is a central design decision. Currently, this machine learning task is usually performed using pixel-wise classification methods. However, the radical shift of the computer vision field away from hand-engineered image features and towards more automation by representation learning comes with many promises, including higher quality results and less engineering effort. In particular, convolutional neural networks learn features which take into account the context of the pixels and, therefore, a better representation of the data can be obtained. In this paper, we assess fully convolutional neural network architectures as replacements for a Random Forest classifier in an operational context for the production of high resolution land cover maps with Sentinel-2 time-series at the country scale. Our contributions include a framework for working with Sentinel-2 L2A time-series image data, an adaptation of the U-Net model (a fully convolutional neural network) for dealing with sparse annotation data while maintaining high resolution output, and an analysis of those results in the context of operational production of land cover maps. We conclude that fully convolutional neural networks can yield improved results with respect to pixel-wise Random Forest classifiers for classes where texture and context are pertinent. However, this new approach shows higher variability in quality across different landscapes and comes with a computational cost which could be to high for operational systems.",2019,124,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3fac59f31d0071de3ff778fc28859d80fe8b0e96,3fac59f31d0071de3ff778fc28859d80fe8b0e96,"A.

"A Multisensor Approach to Satellite Monitoring of Trends in Lake Area, Water Level, and Volume","Lakes in arid regions play an important role in regional water cycles and are a vital economic resource, but can fluctuate widely in area and volume. This study demonstrates the use of a multisensor satellite remote sensing method for the comprehensive monitoring of lake surface areas, water levels, and volume for the Toshka Lakes in southern Egypt, from lake formation in 1998 to mid-2017. Two spectral water indices were used to construct a daily time-series of surface area from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), validated by higher-resolution Landsat images. Water levels were obtained from analysis of digital elevation models from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), validated with ICESat Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) laser altimetry. Total lake volume peaked at 26.54 × 109 m3 in December 2001, and declined to 0.76 × 109 m3 by August 2017. Evaporation accounted for approximately 86% of the loss, and groundwater recharge accounted for 14%. Without additional inflows, the last remaining lake will likely disappear between 2020 and 2022. The Enhanced Lake Index, a water index equivalent to the Enhanced Vegetation Index, was found to have lower noise levels than the Normalized Difference Lake Index. The results show that multi-platform satellite remote sensing provides an efficient method for monitoring the hydrology of lakes.",2019,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a7411e1f37483a98994cf013d140b3ef81f0a2eb,a7411e1f37483a98994cf013d140b3ef81f0a2eb,J.

Technical Framework for Shallow-Water Bathymetry With High Reliability and No Missing Data Based on Time-Series Sentinel-2 Images,"Shallow-water bathymetry based on multispectral satellite imagery (MSI) is an important technology for depth measurement, but it is difficult to obtain a bathymetric map with high reliability and no missing data because of the ubiquitous image noise. Here, we propose a time-series-based bathymetry framework (TSBF). First, a pixel-level time series is constructed using remote sensing images collected at multiple points in time. Then, a new time-domain denoising method, the maximum outlier removal method, is used to create an optimal image from this time series. Finally, bathymetric inversion is performed using this optimal image to obtain a bathymetric map. Anda Reef and northeastern Jiuzhang Atoll, which have complex noise features, were selected as test cases to validate the proposed framework. Results show that the proposed TSBF can obtain bathymetric maps with high accuracy, reliability, and no missing data, outperforming the conventional bathymetry framework based on a single image.",2019,18,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0c126dc04b37833df21b88972be70fb3f17d08c,f0c126dc04b37833df21b88972be70fb3f17d08c,"Sensen Chu, Liang Cheng, Xiaoguang Ruan, Qizhi Zhuang, Xiao Zhou, Manchun Li, Yongzhong Shi"
Time series of flood mapping in the Mekong Delta using high resolution satellite images,"The Mekong Delta, located in Southern Vietnam, is one of the most affected areas in the world by climate change and sea level rises, especially flooding. Therefore, flood mapping is essential for understanding the flood regime and mitigating its impacts. Remote sensing and GIS can support the accurate and area wide evaluation of floods. In this study, high spatial resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data were used to generate a dense satellite data time series for analysing the spatio-temporal patterns of flooding in the Mekong Delta. To derive water masks, a total of 777 Sentinel-1, 515 Sentinel-2 and 57 Landsat-8 scenes were used to generate cloud free water masks at a 10m spatial resolution in regular 10-day intervals throughout the observation period of hydrological years 2016-2017. The results show a spatial explicit information on the core zones of the seasonal flooding processes for the entire Mekong Delta and their effect of using floodwater for rice cultivation. The outcome maps provide an overall understanding of Mekong Delta flood patterns and many valuable information for policymakers and water resources managers.",2019,10,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c071dda903374f97aa08b32b07b2deb8aa89b997,c071dda903374f97aa08b32b07b2deb8aa89b997,"D.
