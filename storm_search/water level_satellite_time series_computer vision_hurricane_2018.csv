Application of ensemble Kalman filter in WRF model to forecast rainfall on monsoon onset period in South Vietnam,"This paper presents some results of rainfall forecast in the monsoon onset period in South Vietnam, with the use of ensemble Kalman filter to assimilate observation data into the initial field of the model. The study of rainfall forecasts are experimented at the time of Southern monsoon outbreaks for 3 years (2005, 2008 and 2009), corresponding to 18 cases. In each case, there are five trials, including satellite wind data assimilation, upper-air sounding data assimilation, mixed data (satellite wind+upper-air sounding data) assimilation and two controlled trials (one single predictive test and one multi-physical ensemble prediction), which is equivalent to 85 forecasts for one trial. Based on the statistical evaluation of 36 samples (18 meteorological stations and 18 trials), the results show that Kalman filter assimilates satellite wind data to forecast well rainfall at 48 hours and 72 hours ranges. With 24 hour forecasting period, upper-air sounding data assimilation and mixed data assimilation experiments predicted better rainfall than non-assimilation tests. The results of the assessment based on the phase prediction indicators also show that the ensemble Kalman filter assimilating satellite wind data and mixed data sets improve the rain forecasting capability of the model at 48 hours and 72 hour ranges, while the upper-air sounding data assimilation test produces satisfactory results at the 72 hour forecast range, and the multi-physical ensemble test predicted good rainfall at 24 hour and 48 hour forecasts. The results of this research initially lead to a new research approach, Kalman Filter Application that assimilates the existing observation data into input data of the model that can improve the quality of rainfall forecast in Southern Vietnam and overall country in general.References Bui Minh Tuan, Nguyen Minh Truong, 2013.

USE OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES IN DECISION OF GEOINFORMATIONAL TASKS,"Computer vision and data analysis are one of the most popular topics both among information technologies and most areas of scientific research. Geography, cartography and geoinformatics with their variety of types of source data, spatial analysis problems, visualization methods, modeling and forecasting methods cannot be better suited for using modern algorithms of machine learning. However, the use of these technologies rarely goes beyond the solution of private tasks of commercial campaigns and, often, is not widely publicized and any systematization or scientific description. In this respect, we decided to make a research of machine learning technologies in the context of using it while solving the most typical problems of geographical research. The classification of problems, algorithms and methods of computer vision from the point of view of geoinformation systems is given. Possible ways of solving some problems of classification and segmentation of raster images are described. The most popular of them are analyzed, including such as the use of convolutional and pre-conditioned neural networks for the recognition of objects on satellite images. The approbation took place within the competition in vectorization of hydrographic objects and the classification of objects in the open sea Statoil / C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge. As initial data, we took marked satellite images of the water surface. The ways of spatial data analysis using the Moran index and calculating the Gini coefficient are considered. The methods of predicting the location of the coordinates of the house and work sudden user using the time series of ATM and cash register transactions at service points using regression algorithms were investigated. To conduct this study, the data set of the AllRussian competition in machine learning Raiffeisen Data Cup was used. We compared the results of usage of the machine learning algorithms and traditional methods of spatial analysis. Based on the results of the fulfilled investigations, we made the conclusions about the usability of the algorithms and technologies for specific geographic tasks, taking into account the dependence of the results from the types of using data used, resources requirements, accuracy, and universality.",2018,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/91b1ecfaed805d1c919e777ad01e08b965888c07,91b1ecfaed805d1c919e777ad01e08b965888c07,"Alexey Kolesniko, P.
