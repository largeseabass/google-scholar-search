Application of active contours in feature extraction in LANDSAT 8 and CBERS 4 images,"Digital images from orbital platforms are the main source of information for mapping and decision-making. Their use has become increasingly popular over the years and has expanded into various areas. Feature extraction in digital images has been widely researched in Image Analysis, Photogrammetry, and Computer Vision. Works related to feature extraction for the generation and updating of GISs are generally divided into anthropic features such as buildings and/or highways and natural features such as vegetation areas or bodies of water. One attractive methodology for feature extraction, especially for rivers and bodies of water, is based on active contours, formulated based on the evolution of curves, which can have parametric models (Snakes) or geometric models (Level set). In this context, this work intends to identify and compare some characteristics of parametric and geometric active contour methods and apply them to orbital images from the OLI and PAN sensors of the LANDSAT 8 and CBERS 4 satellites for feature extraction, correlating these characteristics with the parameters required in the mathematical models of active contours. The present work makes use of Digital Image Processing (DIP) methods, with the first processing stage known as pre-processing, consisting of interconnected tasks that can be used to extract some information about the objects present in the scene. Subsequently, in the processing stage, the features of interest are extracted with the help of the Fiji and Icy software using Level Set and Snake, respectively. Regardless of the method used, the results presented in this work show an extraction time compatible with application needs, as they are developed semi-automatically.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f2db35c3688b4fbaaa2dda8994e63989b55f15c,2f2db35c3688b4fbaaa2dda8994e63989b55f15c,"Cleberton Reiz, Jordan Luiz Dourado Filgueiras, Jader Willian Evaristo, R.
