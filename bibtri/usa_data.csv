Seroprevalence of Chagas Disease Among Latin American Children Living in New York.,"Handel, A. S., H. Hellman, E. Flores and C. Beneri.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=15801,2022,"Among a small cohort of first- and second-generation Latin American children living in theunitedstates, we found a seroprevalence rate of approximately 1%, consistent with the seropositivity rate in endemic Latin American countries. Consistent with prior seroprevalence studies, Chagas disease is rare, and identifying those at highest risk of infection remains a challenge. As a result, universal screening of children born in Latin America may be the optimal method for identifying asymptomatic infections. Among those children born in theunitedstatesto mothers who lived in Latin America, maternal screening is likely a more cost-efficient approach than testing all secondgeneration children. Early identification of Chagas disease enables children to receive well-tolerated, highly effective antiparasitic medications, preventing severe morbidity during adulthood."
"Chagas Disease Ecology in the United States: Recent Advances in Understanding Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission Among Triatomines,Wildlife, and Domestic Animals and a Quantitative Synthesis of Vector–Host Interactions.","Busselman, R. E. and S. A. Hamer.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=15838,2022,"Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease present in the Americas, is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is transmitted by triatomine kissing bug vectors. Hundreds of vertebrate host species are involved in the ecology of Chagas disease. The sylvatic nature of most triatomines found in theunitedstatesaccounts for high levels of animal infections but few reports of human infections. This review focuses on triatomine distributions and animal infections in the southernunitedstates. A quantitative synthesis of available US data from triatomine bloodmeal analysis studies shows that dogs, humans, and rodents are key taxa for feeding triatomines. Imperfect and unvalidated diagnostic tools in wildlife complicate the study of animal T. cruzi infections, and integrated vector management approaches are needed to reduce parasite transmission in nature. The diversity of animal species involved in Chagas disease ecology underscores the importance of a One Health approach for disease research and management."
"Characteristics and Adverse Events of Patients for Whom Nifurtimox Was Released Through CDC-Sponsored Investigational New Drug Program for Treatment of Chagas Disease - United States, 2001–2021.","Abbott, A., S. P. Montgomery, and R. J. Chancey.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=15908,2022,"What is already known about this topic? Nifurtimox is used to treat Chagas disease. During 2001–2021, CDC sponsored an Investigational New Drug protocol, which made nifurtimox available for treatment of Chagas disease in theunitedstates. What is added by this report? CDC released nifurtimox to 336 patients, 34.2% of whom were in California. Most patients were aged 18 years (91.8%; 305 of 332) and Hispanic (93.2%; 290 of 311). Among 243 treated patients reporting information about adverse events, 91.4% (222 of 243) experienced at least one adverse event. What are the implications for public health practice? Nifurtimox is now commercially available as Lampit (Bayer) and is no longer distributed by CDC. Physicians should be aware of the frequency of adverse events when prescribing nifurtimox."
Diagnosis and Clinical Management of Chagas Disease: An Increasing Challenge in Non-Endemic Areas.,"Suárez, C., D. Nolder, A. García-Mingo, D. A. J. Moore and P. L. Chiodini.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=16694,2022,"Chagas disease (CD) is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and it is endemic in Central, South America, Mexico and the South of theunitedstates. It is an important cause of early mortality and morbidity, and it is associated with poverty and stigma. A third of the cases evolve into chronic cardiomyopathy and gastrointestinal disease. The infection is transmitted vertically and by blood/organ donation and can reactivate with immunosuppression. Case identification requires awareness and screening programmes targeting the population at risk (women in reproductive age, donors, immunocompromised patients). Treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox is most effective in the acute phase and prevents progression to chronic phase when given to children. Treating women antenatally reduces but does not eliminate vertical transmission. Treatment is poorly tolerated, contraindicated during pregnancy, and has little effect modifying the disease in the chronic phase. Screening is easily performed with serology. Migration has brought the disease outside of the endemic countries, where the transmission continues vertically and via blood and tissue/organ donations. There are more than 32 million migrants from Latin America living in non-endemic countries. However, the infection is massively underdiagnosed in this setting due to the lack of awareness by patients, health authorities and professionals. Blood and tissue donation screening policies have significantly reduced transmission in endemic countries but are not universally established in the non-endemic setting. Antenatal screening is not commonly done. Other challenges include difficulties accessing and retaining patients in the healthcare system and lack of specific funding for the interventions. Any strategy must be accompanied by education and awareness campaigns directed to patients, professionals and policy makers. The involvement of patients and their communities is central and key for success and must be sought early and actively. This review proposes strategies to address challenges faced by non-endemic countries."
"Collection of triatomines from sylvatic habitats by a Chagas-positive, trained scent-detection canine in Texas, USA.","Christopher, D. M., R. Curtis-Robles, G. L. Hamer, J. Bejcek, A. B. Saunders, W. D. Roachell, T. L. Cropper and S. A. Hamer.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=17263,2022,"Background Triatomine insects, vectors of the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), are challenging to locate in sylvatic habitats. Collection techniques used in theunitedstatesoften rely on methods to intercept seasonally dispersing adults or on community scientists’ encounters. Neither method is suited for detecting nidicolous habitats, which is important for vector control. Furthermore, manual inspection of suspected harborages is unlikely to reveal novel locations and host associations. Similar to a team that used a trained dog to detect sylvatic triatomines in Paraguay, we worked with a trained scent detection dog to detect sylvatic locations of triatomines across Texas. Principle methodology Findings Ziza, a 3-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer previously naturally infected with T. cruzi, was trained to detect triatomines. Over the course of 6 weeks in the fall of 2017, the dog and her handler visited 18 sites across Texas. The dog detected 60 triatomines at 7 locations; an additional 50 triatomines were contemporaneously collected at these sites without the assistance of the dog. Approximately 0.98 triatomines per hour were found when only humans were conducting searches; when working with the dog, approximately 1.71 triatomines per hour were found. In total, 3 adults and 107 nymphs of four species (Triatoma gerstaeckeri, Triatoma protracta, Triatoma sanguisuga, and Triatoma indictiva) were collected. PCR testing of a subset revealed T. cruzi infection, including DTUs TcI and TcIV, in 28% of nymphs (n=100) and 66% of adults (n=3). Blood meal analysis of a subset of triatomines (n=5) revealed feeding on Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus) and eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus). Conclusion Significance A trained scent detection dog enhanced triatomine detections in sylvatic habitats. This approach is especially effective at detecting triatomine nymphs and nidicolous locations. With new knowledge of specific sylvatic habitats and key hosts fed upon by triatomines, there are opportunities for continued exploration of novel vector control methods to block the transmission of T. cruzi to humans and domestic animals."
How does academia respond to the burden of infectious and parasitic disease?.,"Zhao, W., L. Wang and L. Zhang.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=17316,2022,"Background: Academic research is one of the main avenues through which humans can fight the threat of infectious diseases. However, there have been concerns regarding whether the academic system has provided sufficient efforts to fight infectious diseases we potentially face. Answering these questions could contribute to evidence-based recommendations for setting research priorities and third-mission policies. Methods: With a focus on one of the most common categories of communicable diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases (IPDs), we searched Web of Science for articles and reviews relevant to IPDs published during the period 2000–2019 and retrieved WHO data on disease burden in corresponding years. The academic response patterns were explored by IPD subcategory and by human development level (an index established by theunitedNations). We conduct the analysis in particular to gain insight into the dynamic relationship between disease burden and research effort on IPDs, scientific efforts contributed by countries with different development levels, and the variation trends in international joint efforts. Results: The greatest burden of IPDs is clustered in the developing regions of Africa, but has received academic response from both developed and developing countries. Highly developed countries dominate the ranks of academic research in this area, yet there is also a clear increase in research efforts from the countries most affected, despite their low human development scale. In fact, the overall analysis reveals an improved capability for addressing local problems from African regions. In terms of international collaboration, highly developed countries such as theunitedstatesandunitedKingdom have commonly collaborated with needy regions, whereas prolific but developing nations, like China, have not. Conclusions: From a global perspective, academia has positively responded to health needs caused by IPDs. Although the relevant research output contribution is primarily from the highly developed countries, concentrated and specialized efforts from the undeveloped regions to ease their local burden can be clearly observed. Our findings also indicate a tendency to focus more on local health needs for both developed and undeveloped regions. The insights revealed in this study should benefit a more informed and systemic plan of research priorities."
"Southwestern national park service employee risk, knowledge, and concern for triatomine exposure: A qualitative analysis using a novel knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey.","Alvarado, A., E. M. Mader, D. Buttke and L. C. Harrington.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=17359,2022,"Chagas disease (CD), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected parasitic infection in theunitedstates(US). In the Southwestern US, National Park Service (NPS) employees are a unique population with potential exposure to CD. This population lives in close contact with several species of sylvatic triatomine bugs, the vectors of T. cruzi, that may enter residential buildings at night. Despite the higher potential risk of CD transmission for southwestern NPS employees, the socio-cultural factors that impact autochthonous CD transmission in the US remain unknown. To address this gap, we investigated how NPS employee knowledge and attitudes impact their triatomine preventive behaviors. We distributed a 42-item online questionnaire to NPS employees at four national parks in Arizona and Texas. We detected high self-reported bite exposure in NPS housing, despite moderate- to high-frequency of prevention behaviors. Specific behaviors, such as often or always repairing window screens, were associated with a decreased risk of putative triatomine bug exposure. Additionally, NPS employees had low knowledge of CD. For those with greater knowledge of CD, it was not associated with increased frequency of prevention behavior. We found that increased CD anxiety was associated with increased personal agency to reduce the risk of CD. These results demonstrate the influence of knowledge and attitudes regarding CD on triatomine prevention behavior within a potential high-risk population in the US, and the importance of utilizing strategies beyond provision of education to influence behaviors."
Reactions to bites from kissing bugs (primarily genus Triatoma).,"Goddard, J. and R. D. deShazo.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=17762,2022,"Triatoma insects (colloquial names include kissing bug, Mexican bed bug, and cone-nosed bug) are found primarily in the western and southernunitedstates, Central and South America, and Mexico (picture 1 and picture 2). Kissing bug bites are usually painless and undetected by the victim. However, these insects are of medical importance both because they can transmit the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease, and also because people can develop life-threatening allergic reactions to their bites. Local reactions to Triatoma bites, most commonly consisting of erythema and edema around the puncture sites (picture 3), develop in some patients and are managed symptomatically. (See 'Local reactions' above.) Allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to Triatoma bites typically occur in the middle of the night, as Triatoma are nocturnal and bite while the victim sleeps. With the exception of this one distinguishing feature, the signs and symptoms of Triatoma anaphylaxis may be identical to those resulting from other triggers. Fatal and near-fatal cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. Acute treatment of anaphylaxis following a Triatoma bite is identical to acute treatment of anaphylaxis of any etiology.Upon discharge, all patients with anaphylaxis should be equipped with an epinephrine autoinjector and an anaphylaxis emergency action plan to manage initial treatment of recurrent episodes. Epinephrine should be kept at the bedside in the future. Once a patient with anaphylaxis has been stabilized, the home (or relevant site) should be thoroughly searched for the blood-engorged insect as soon as possible.If necessary, pest management professionals may be called upon to aid in the inspection process.Identification of the insect is important for diagnosis because reagents for skin testing and laboratory diagnosis are not available.Proper insect identification can be obtained from a local college or university entomology department or the extension service at participating land-grant universities nationwide. Patients should be given information about how to prevent future contact with Triatoma, including modifications of their homes, bedrooms, and surrounding environment.If kissing bugs are suspected to be present or found in the home, a pest management professional should be contacted. Specific immunotherapy to reduce an allergic patient's sensitivity to Triatoma is not commercially available.Thus, avoidance and education about early recognition and treatment of recurrent allergic reactions is critical."
Chagas disease in Oklahoma.,"Agudelo Higuita, N. I., M. S. Bronze, J. W. Smith and S. P. Montgomery.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=17765,2022,"Chagas disease, caused by infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is one of the leading public health problems in the Western Hemisphere. The parasite is mainly transmitted by contact with infected insect vectors but other forms of transmission are important in endemic areas. In theunitedstates, while the disease is largely restricted to immigrants from endemic countries in Latin America, there is some risk of local acquisition. T. cruzi circulates in a sylvatic cycle between mammals and local triatomine insects in the southern half of the country, where human residents may be at risk for incidental infection. There are several reported cases of locally-acquired Chagas disease in theunitedstates, but there is a paucity of information in Oklahoma. We present a brief summary of the available data of Chagas disease in Oklahoma to raise awareness and serve as a foundation for future research."
Enzootic cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi: Environmental diagnosis and sentinel dogs.,"das Chagas Xavier, S. C. and A. M. Jansen.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=18534,2022,"As a multi-host and paninfective parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi (Trypanosomatidae, Kinetoplastea) is maintained in nature by complex transmission cycles in which humans can be part and develop Chagas disease. Currently, transmission of T. cruzi to humans occurs predominantly in the Amazon, through ingestion of food contaminated by wild, non-domiciled and infected triatomines. This new epidemiological framework requires new surveillance and control strategies for rapid adoption of control measures. Here we propose three axes of action: 1) To monitor T. cruzi infection in domestic dogs as sentinels of the presence of an enzootic cycle happening in the vicinity of human living areas. Dogs are easily handled and traceable and it has already been shown that from six months onwards, when they start to roam in the environment, they may be exposed to T. cruzi. Localities where 30% of dogs display serological titers above 1:40 are areas of enzootic transmission. 2) The performance of the Chagas Lateral Flow Immunochromatographic Rapid Test (Bio-Manguinhos) that was evaluated and validated in house to use still in the field for the serological diagnosis of T. cruzi infection of dogs. 3) To conduct a spatial analysis and predictive models to implement socio-educational measures in risk areas to avoid new outbreaks and cases of Chagas disease, one of the most neglected diseases in Latin America, but that is increasingly expanding in the south of theunitedstatesand elsewhere in the world by migratory movements."

Chagas disease is endemic to Latin America and the southernunitedstatesand can cause severe cardiac damage in infected mammals, ranging from chronic disease to sudden death. Identifying interactions among triatomines, T. cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs), and blood feeding hosts is necessary to understand parasite transmission dynamics and effectively protect animal and human health. Through manual insect trapping efforts, kennel staff collections, and with the help of a trained scent detection dog, we collected triatomines from 10 multi-dog kennels across central and south Texas over a one-year period (2018–2019) and tested a subset to determine their T. cruzi infection status and identify the primary bloodmeal hosts. We collected 550 triatomines, including Triatoma gerstaeckeri (n = 515), Triatoma lecticularia (n = 15), Triatoma sanguisuga (n = 6), and Triatoma indictiva (n = 2), with an additional 10 nymphs and 2 adults unable to be identified to species. The trained dog collected 42 triatomines, including nymphs, from areas not previously considered vector habitat by the kennel owners. Using qPCR, we found a T. cruzi infection prevalence of 47 % (74/157), with T. lecticularia individuals more likely to be infected with T. cruzi than other species. Infected insects harbored two T. cruzi discrete typing units: TcI (64 %), TcIV (23 %), and mixed TcI/TcIV infections (13 %). Bloodmeal host identification was successful in 50/149 triatomines, revealing the majority (74 %) fed on a dog (Canis lupus), with other host species including humans (Homo sapiens), raccoons (Procyon lotor), chickens (Gallus gallus), wild pig (Sus scrofa), black vulture (Coragyps atratus), cat (Felis catus), and curve-billed thrasher (Toxostoma curviostre). Given the frequency of interactions between dogs and infected triatomines in these kennel environments, dogs may be an apt target for future vector control and T. cruzi intervention efforts."

We evaluated a multicenter U.S.-based network to obtain clinical characteristics and outcomes of chronic Chagas disease by disease forms. This was a U.S.-based, multicenter, population-based, retrospective cohort study. We queried TriNetX, a global research network, to identify patients with dual-positive IgG serology for Trypanosoma cruzi. We captured outcomes of interest for up to 5 years. We found 429 patients with evidence of dual-positive T. cruzi IgG out of 19,831 patients with an available test result from 31U.S. medical centers. The positive proportion for those tested was 2.2%, up to 4.6% among Hispanics. We found a prevalence of a positive Chagas serology of 0.02% among Hispanics. Cardiomyopathy risk reached an annual rate of 1.3% during the initial 5 years of follow-up among patients with the indeterminate form. We found no new events for pulmonary embolism, sudden death, or left ventricular aneurysms at 5 years. Annual risks for arrhythmias and stroke for chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) were 1.6% and 0.8%, respectively. The yearly mortality and hospitalization rates for CCC were 2.7% and 17.1%, respectively. Only 13 patients had a documented antitrypanosomal therapy course within 6 months after diagnosis. Of those receiving treatment, 10 patients received benznidazole and three nifurtimox. Chagas disease screening in patients from endemic areas living in theunitedstatesremains crucial. Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy carries a considerable disease burden, translating into increased morbidity and mortality and an enlarging medical health service utilization."
Veterinary Chagas Disease (American Trypanosomiasis) in the United States.,"Hamer, S. A. and A. B.

Veterinary awareness for Chagas disease should not be restricted to the south because infected pets may move to other regions with their owners. There is wide variation in clinical outcomes in infected dogs. Some remain asymptomatic, whereas others develop Chagas myocarditis, which can result in chronic disease or sudden death. Infected animals are typically managed symptomatically but promising new research suggests antiparasitic treatment options may be more readily available in the future. Vector control approaches and raising awareness among dog owners and the veterinary community for triatomines and Chagas disease is critical, especially as the vector populations are predicted to expand due to climate change.76 Owners of infected dogs should be educated about vector control and habitat management approaches to reduce interactions of triatomines with dogs and other species (Box 3). Given T cruzi is a zoonotic agent, advancing our understanding of veterinary Chagas disease can provide information relevant for protecting human health and vice versa."
Genetic diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi infecting raccoons (Procyon lotor) in two metropolitan areas of southern Louisiana: implications for parasite transmission networks,"Majeau, A., E. Cloherty, A. Nikki Anderson, S. C. Straif-Bourgeois, E. Dumonteil, and C. Herrera",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=18910,2023,"Abstract Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, exists as an anthropozoonosis in Louisiana. Raccoons are an important reservoir, as they demonstrate high prevalence and maintain high parasitemia longer than other mammals. Given the complex nature of parasite transmission networks and importance of raccoons as reservoirs that move between sylvatic and domestic environments, detailing the genetic diversity of T. cruzi in raccoons is crucial to assess risk to human health. Using a next-generation sequencing approach targeting the mini-exon, parasite diversity was assessed in two metropolitan areas of Louisiana. Sequences were analysed along with those previously identified in other mammals and vectors to determine if any association exists between ecoregion and parasite diversity. Parasites were identified from discrete typing units (DTUs) TcI, TcII, TcIV, TcV, and TcVI. DTUs TcII, TcV, and TcVI are previously unreported in raccoons in the US. TcI was the most abundant DTU, comprising nearly 80% of all sequences. All but one raccoon harboured multiple haplotypes, some demonstrating mixed infections of different DTUs. Furthermore, there is significant association between DTU distribution and level III ecoregion in Louisiana. Finally, while certain sequences were distributed across multiple tissues, others appeared to have tissue-specific tropism. Taken together, these findings indicate that ongoing surveillance of T. cruzi in theunitedstates(US) should be undertaken across ecoregions to fully assess risk to human health. Given potential connections between parasite diversity and clinical outcomes, deep sequencing technologies are crucial and interventions targeting raccoons may prove useful in mitigating human health risk.

An expert curation strategy was combined with a text-mining approach to screen 10,234 full-length research articles and over 200,000 abstracts relevant to T. cruzi. We obtained a scale-free network consisting of 1055 nodes and 874 edges, and composed of 838 proteins, 43 genes, 20 complexes, 9 RNAs, 36 simple molecules, 81 phenotypes, and 37 known pharmaceuticals. Further, we deployed an automated docking pipeline to conduct large-scale docking studies involving several thousand drugs and potential targets to identify network-based binding propensities. These experiments have revealed that the existing FDA-approved drugs benznidazole (Bz) and nifurtimox (Nf) show comparatively high binding energies to the T. cruzi network proteins (e.g., PIF1 helicase-like protein, trans-sialidase), when compared with control datasets consisting of proteins from other pathogens.

Conventional tests are currently used with very good results but require time, laboratory infrastructure, and expertise. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are an alternative as the results are immediate and do not require specialized knowledge, making them suitable for epidemiologic studies and promising as a screening tool. Nevertheless, few studies conducted comparative evaluations of RDTs to validate the results and assess their performance. In this study, we analyzed four trades of rapid tests (OnSite Chagas Ab Combo Rapid Test-unitedstates, SD Bioline Chagas ABunitedstates, WL Check Chagas-Argentina, and TR Chagas Bio-Manguinhos- Brazil) using a panel of 190 samples, including sera from 111 infected individuals, most of whom had low T. cruzi antibody levels. An additional 59 samples from uninfected individuals and 20 sera from individuals with other diseases, mainly visceral leishmaniasis, were included. All tests were performed by three independent laboratories in a blinded manner. Results showed differences in sensitivity from 92.8 to 100%, specificity from 78.5 to 92.4%, and accuracy from 90.5 to 95.3% among the four assays. The results presented here show that all four RDTs have high overall diagnostic ability. However, WL Check Chagas and TR Chagas Bio-Manguinhos were considered most suitable for use in screening studies due to their high sensitivity combined with good performance. Although these two RDTs have high sensitivity, a positive result should be confirmed with other tests to confirm or rule out reactivity/ positivity, especially considering possible cross-reactivity with individuals with leishmaniasis or toxoplasmosis."

Control of sylvatic sources of triatomines is challenging, but this new knowledge of specific sylvatic habitats and key hosts may reveal opportunities for novel vector control methods to block the transmission of T. cruzi to humans and domestic animals."
Effect of clinician information sessions on diagnostic testing for Chagas disease.,"West, H. M., C. E. Milliren, J. Manne-Goehler, J. Davis, J. Gallegos, J. H. Perez and J. R. Kohler.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=19141,2022,"Background Chagas disease is a potentially life-threatening neglected disease of poverty that is endemic in continental Latin America. Caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), it is one of six parasitic diseases in theunitedstatestargeted by the Centers for Disease Control as a public health problem in need of action. An estimated 300,000 people are infected with T. cruzi in theunitedstates(US). Although its morbidity, mortality and economic burden are high, awareness of Chagas disease is lacking among many healthcare providers in the US. The purpose of this analysis is to determine if the number of diagnostic tests performed at a community health center serving an at-risk population for Chagas disease increased after information sessions. A secondary aim was to determine if there was a difference by provider type, i.e., nurse practitioner vs. physician, or by specialty in the number of patients screened. Methodology/Principal findings We conducted a retrospective data analysis of the number of Chagas serology tests performed at a community health center before and after information sessions for clinicians. A time series analysis was conducted focusing on the Adult and Family Medicine Departments at East Boston Neighborhood Health Center (EBNHC). Across all departments there were 1,957 T. cruzi tests performed before the sessions vs. 2,623 after the sessions. Interrupted time series analysis across departments indicated that testing volume was stable over time prior to the sessions (pre-period slope = +4.1 per month; p = 0.12), followed by an immediate shift after the session (+51.6; p = 0.03), while testing volume remained stable over time after the session (post-period slope = -6.0 per month; p = 0.11). Conclusion/Significance In this study, Chagas testing increased after information sessions. Clinicians who began testing their patients for Chagas disease after learning of the importance of this intervention added an extra, potentially time-consuming task to their already busy workdays without external incentives or recognition."

ICD-9 and 10 inpatient hospital diagnostic codes were used to illustrate the salience of potentially missed CD diagnoses (e.g., cardiomyopathic diagnoses) and where these are occurring with more frequency. Coding software along with GIS and Microsoft Excel 3D mapping were used to generate maps to illustrate where there may be a need for increased statewide surveillance and screening of populations at greater risk for CD. The CD cases reported to the Texas Department of State Healthcare Services (TxDSHS) are not homogenously dispersed throughout the state but rather, reveal that the incidences are in clusters and primarily in urban areas, where there is increased access to physician care, CD research and diagnostic capabilities."

Mehta.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=19174,2022,"Chagas disease is a neglected parasitic infection and a major public health problem in the Americas. It remains underdiagnosed in theunitedstatesand internationally due to the lack of affordable testing and disparities in healthcare, particularly for those most at risk. We describe a proof-of-concept lateral flow immunoassay employing a recombinant Chagas multiantigen conjugated to gold nanoshells (AuNS) to detect circulating human anti-Chagas IgG antibodies. This is one of the first lateral flow immunoassays to capitalize on the larger surface area of AuNS compared with nanoparticles that can help amplify low-magnitude signals. Results were compared with 42 positive and negative Chagas serum samples, of which a subset of 27 samples was validated against an ELISA (Hemagen). The sensitivity and specificity of our assay were 83% and 95%, respectively. These results suggest that an AuNS-based rapid testing for Chagas disease could facilitate in-field screening/diagnosis with a performance comparable to commercial methods."

The search and data analysis were performed by independent reviewers; all qualitative studies that reported the factors that had an impact on the HRQoL of patients with Chagas disease were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program Qualitative Study Checklist; confidence in the evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative approach. Five studies were included in this review: four in Brazil and one in California,unitedstates, with immigrants from Central and South America. The sample consisted of 207 patients with chronic Chagas disease. Stigma, physical limitations, work absenteeism, emotional or mental aspects, fear of treatment, and fear of the future had the strongest impact on the HRQoL. All items showed moderate confidence except for fear of treatment (low confidence). The physical, emotional, mental, and cultural aspects affected the HRQoL of patients with chronic Chagas disease. Identification of these factors is important in the development of strategies aimed at improving the HRQoL of this population."
"Identification of the parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, in multiple tissues of epidemiological significance in the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana): Implications for environmental and vertical transmission routes.","Torhorst, C. W., Z. S. White, C. R. Bhosale, N. L. Beatty and S. M. Wisely.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=19190,2022,"Background Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasitic protozoan, is endemic to the Americas and the causative agent of Chagas disease in humans. In South America, opossums facilitate transmission via infected anal gland secretions in addition to transmission via triatomine vectors. In North America, the Virginia opossum is a reservoir host for the parasite with transmission routes that are not clearly defined. The unique biology of this marsupial provides the opportunity to investigate vertical transmission in this wildlife species in situ. Our objectives were to investigate alternative routes of transmission that may facilitate spillover into other species and to determine if vertical transmission was evident. Methodology/Principal findings Virginia opossums were sampled at 10 trapping locations over a 10-month period in a 5- county region of north central Florida. Peripheral blood, fecal swabs, and anal gland secretions were collected from each adult individual, and peripheral blood was collected from joey opossums. Total DNA was extracted from each collected sample type, and T. cruzi infected individuals and the infecting Discrete Typing Unit (DTU) were identified using real time PCR methods. Adult Virginia opossums (n = 112) were infected with T. cruzi (51.8%, 95% CI [42.6–60.8%]) throughout the sampled period and at each location. T. cruzi DNA was found in each of the three biological sample types. Vertical transmission of T. cruzi was inferred in one litter of mother-dependent (n = 20, 5.0%, 95% CI [0.9–23.6%]) joey opossums where 2 joeys from this same litter were rtPCR positive for T. cruzi. Conclusions/Significance We inferred vertical transmission from mother to neonate which may serve to amplify the prevalence of T. cruzi in adult Virginia opossums. T. cruzi DNA was detected in the anal gland secretions of Virginia opossums. Infected anal gland secretions suggest a possible environmental route of transmission for T. cruzi via the deposition of contaminated feces and spraint at wildlife latrines. Only DTU1 was identified in the sampled population which is consistent with human autochthonous cases in theunitedstates."
"Phenology and environmental predictors of Triatoma sanguisuga dispersal in east-central Texas, United States.","Fimbres-Macias, J. P., T. A. Harris, S. A. Hamer and G. L. Hamer.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=19245,2023,"Of 11 triatomine species in theunitedstates(US), Triatoma sanguisuga has the widest distribution across a 23- state region encompassing the southeastern US. This species consistently feeds on humans and dogs and has a high infection prevalence with the Chagas parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, with over 30–60% of adults infected. Little is known about the phenology and environmental predictors of dispersal activity of Triatoma sanguisuga. Using manual searches standardized by effort, we sampled kissing bugs in east central Texas, US every other night from June to November 2020 to determine their phenology and environmental predictors of activity. We found 176 triatomines alive, all of which were T. sanguisuga, with peak collections in early August and cessation of activity by late October; the phenology as determined by this active surveillance matched what has been reported using a passive community science approach. Using a negative binomial regression, we found temperature to have a positive correlation with T. sanguisuga dispersal activity, while wind speed had a significant negative correlation. We identified increased collections during sampling sessions with precipitation during the preceding 22 h. Further, wind from the southwest - the direction of most of the sylvatic habitat in the study area - was correlated with an increased dispersal activity, suggesting wind-facilitated dispersal. Given concerns for human and animal Chagas disease within the distribution of T. sanguisuga, vector control strategies can be adapted based on the factors influencing dispersal behavior."

Murray.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=19252,2023,"Chagas disease is one of the world’s most neglected tropical diseases, infecting over six million people across the Americas. The hemoparasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent for the disease, circulating in domestic, peridomestic, and sylvatic transmission cycles that are maintained by triatomine vectors and a diversity of wild and synanthropic hosts. Public health and wildlife management interventions targeting the interruption of T. cruzi transmission rely on an understanding of the dynamics driving the ecology of this zoonotic pathogen. One wildlife host that purportedly plays a role in the transmission of Chagas disease within the southernunitedstatesis the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), though infection prevalence in this species is poorly understood. To this end, we conducted a PCR-based surveillance of T. cruzi in 235 wild skunks, representing four species, across 76 counties and ten ecoregions in Texas, USA, along with an evaluation of risk factors associated with infection. We recovered an overall T. cruzi prevalence of 17.9% for all mephitid taxa aggregated, ranging between 6.7% for plains spotted skunks (Spilogale putorius interrupta) and 42.9% for western spotted skunks (S. gracilis). We report the first cases of T. cruzi infection in plains spotted and American hog-nosed skunks (Conepatus leuconotus), of important note for conservation medicine since populations of both species are declining within Texas. Although not statistically significant, we also detected trends for juveniles to exhibit greater infection risk than adults and for differential sex biases in T. cruzi prevalence between taxa, which align with variations in species-specific seasonal activity patterns. No geographic or taxonomic risk factors were identified. Our study contributes key data for population viability analyses and epidemiologic models in addition to providing a baseline for future T. cruzi surveillance among skunks and other wildlife species."

National regulatory authorities, such as theunitedstatesFood and Drug Administration (FDA), play an essential role in this effort to ensure access to safe and effective medical products by working within a set of legal frameworks and regulatory functions. However, medical product development for NTDs remains neglected, as combating NTDs is not a viable commercial market for pharmaceutical companies. To spur research and development (R&D) of NTD products, the US government has authorized various programs and policies to engage pharmaceutical companies, many of which provide FDA with the legal authority to implement NTD programs and pathways. Thus, this review provides a clear overview of the various regulatory pathways and programs employed by the FDA to increase the availability of NTD drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. The review assesses the available information on various regulatory considerations and their impact on NTD product development as a first step in estimating the importance of such programs. Next, findings related to currently approved NTD products through these programs are discussed. Lastly, gaps in NTD R&D are identified and suggestions on how to address these are presented. The available data shows that while such incentive programs are factored into companies’ decisions to pursue NTD R&D, approved products for NTDs remains vastly insufficient. Most approved products that utilize these NTD regulatory pathways and programs are overwhelmingly for tuberculosis and malaria—both of which are not considered NTDs by the World Health Organization (WHO). Dedicated efforts are needed to facilitate and accelerate NTD product including employing multiple incentive programs, regular assessment of such programs, and leveraging on public–private partnerships."
Exclusion of Horizontal and Vertical Transmission as Major Sources of Trypanosoma cruzi Infections in a Breeding Colony of Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta).,"Kiehl, W. M., C. L. Hodo, G. L. Hamer, S. A Hamer and G. K. Wilkerson.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=19349,2023,"The vector-borne protozoal parasite Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease in humans and animals. This parasite is endemic to the southernunitedstateswhere outdoor-housed NHP at biomedical facilities are at risk of infection. In addition to the direct morbidity caused by T. cruzi, infected animals are of limited biomedical research use because infections can produce confounding pathophysiologic changes even in animals with no clinical disease. In part due to concerns for direct T. cruzi transmission between animals, infected NHP at some institutions have been culled, removed, or otherwise isolated from uninfected animal populations. However, data that document horizontal or vertical transmission in captive NHP in theunitedstatesare not available. To evaluate the potential for inter-animal transmission and to identify environmental factors that affect the distribution of new infections in NHPs, we conducted a retrospective epidemiologic study of a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) breeding colony in south Texas. We used archived biologic samples and husbandry records to identify the time and location of macaque seroconversion. These data were used to perform a spatial analysis of how geographic location and animal associations affected the spread of disease and to infer the importance of horizontal or vertical routes of transmission. The majority of T. cruzi infections were spatially clustered, suggesting that environmental factors promoted vector exposure in various areas of the facility. Although we cannot not rule out horizontal transmission, our data suggest that horizontal transmission was not a critical route for spread for the disease. Vertical transmission was not a contributing factor in this colony. In conclusion, our findings suggest that local triatome vectors were the major source of T. cruzi infections in captive macaques in our colony. Therefore, limiting contact with vectors, rather than segregation of infected macaques, is a key strategy for disease prevention at institutions that house macaques outdoors in the southernunitedstates."
Comparative proteomic analysis of the hemolymph and salivary glands of Rhodnius prolixus and R. colombiensis reveals candidates associated with differential lytic activity against Trypanosoma cruzi I and T. cruzi II.,"Barbosa, H.

Vallejo.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=19370,2023,"Background Immune response of triatomines plays an important role in the success or failure of transmission of T. cruzi. Studies on parasite–vector interaction have shown the presence of trypanolytic factors and have been observed to be differentially expressed among triatomines, which affects the transmission of some T. cruzi strains or DTUs (Discrete Typing Units).  Methodology/Principal Findings Trypanolytic factors were detected in the hemolymph and saliva of R. prolixus against epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of T. cruzi II. To identify the components of the immune response that could be involved in this lytic activity, a comparative proteomic analysis was carried out, detecting 120 proteins in the hemolymph of R. prolixus and 107 in R. colombiensis. In salivary glands, 1103 proteins were detected in R. prolixus and 853 in R. colombiensis. A higher relative abundance of lysozyme, prolixin, nitrophorins, and serpin as immune response proteins was detected in the hemolymph of R. prolixus. Among the R. prolixus salivary proteins, a higher relative abundance of nitrophorins, lipocalins, and triabins was detected. The higher relative abundance of these immune factors in R. prolixus supports their participation in the lytic activity on T. cruzi II, but not on T. cruzi I, which is resistant to lysis by hemolymph and salivary proteins of R. prolixus due to mechanisms of evading oxidative stress caused by immune factors.  Conclusions/Significance T. cruzi I is a DTU distributed from the southernunitedstatesto the center of Chile and Argentina, and its successful spread across this range could be related to resistance to oxidative stress in vectors. Future proteomic and transcriptomic studies on vectors and the interactions of the intestinal microbiota with parasites will help to confirm the determinants of successful or failed vector transmission of T. cruzi DTUs in different parts of the Western Hemisphere."

T. cruzi is transmitted to humans by the bite of triatomine vectors; both the parasite and disease are endemic in Latin America and theunitedstates. In the last decades, population migration has changed the classic epidemiology of T. cruzi, contributing to its global spread to traditionally nonendemic countries. Screening is recommended for Latin American populations residing in non-endemic countries. Methods The present study analyzes the epidemiological characteristics of 2,820 Latin American individuals who attended the International Health Service (IHS) of the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona between 2002 and 2019. The initial assessment of organ damage among positive cases of T. cruzi infection was analyzed, including the results of electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, barium enema and esophagogram. Results Among all the screened individuals attending the clinic, 2,441 (86.6%) were born in Bolivia and 1,993 (70.7%) were female. Of individuals, 1,517 (81.5%) reported previous exposure to the vector, which is a strong risk factor associated with T. cruzi infection; 1,382 individuals were positive for T. cruzi infection. The first evaluation of individuals with confirmed T. cruzi infection, showed 148 (17.1%) individuals with Chagasic cardiomyopathy, the main diagnostic method being an ECG and the right bundle branch block (RBBB) for the most frequent disorder; 16 (10.8%) individuals had a normal ECG and were diagnosed of Chagasic cardiomyopathy by echocardiogram. Conclusions We still observe many Latin American individuals who were at risk of T. cruzi infection in highly endemic areas in their countries of origin, and who have not been previously tested for T. cruzi infection. In fact, even in Spain, a country with one of the highest proportion of diagnosis of Latin American populations, T. cruzi infection remains underdiagnosed. The screening of Latin American populations presenting with a similar profile as reported here should be promoted. ECG is considered necessary to assess Chagasic cardiomyopathy in positive individuals, but echocardiograms should also be considered as a diagnostic approach given that it can detect cardiac abnormalities when the ECG is normal."

In theunitedstates, raccoons (Procyon lotor) and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) are known synanthropic T. cruzi reservoir hosts; however, the role these species have in the peridomestic transmission cycle in the US is not well understood. This study aimed to identify the suite of mammalian reservoirs of T. cruzi in Florida. We also compared infection prevalence in raccoon populations sampled from within and outside of the estimated distribution of the common T. cruzi vector in Florida to gain insight into how the arthropod vector distribution impacts the distribution of infected reservoirs in the state. Finally, to investigate the impact of peridomestic landscapes on parasite prevalence, we compared the prevalence of T. cruzi-infected raccoons and opossums across five paired peridomestic and sylvatic sites.

CD leads to cardiac and/or gastrointestinal disease in up to 30% of untreated people. However, end-organ damage can be prevented with early diagnosis and antiparasitic therapy.  Methods We reviewed electronic health records of patients who underwent testing for CD at four hospital systems in California and Texas between 2016 and 2020. Descriptive analyses were performed as a needs assessment for improving CD diagnosis.  Results In total, 470 patients were tested for CD. Cardiac indications made up more than half (60%) of all testing, and the most frequently cited cardiac condition was heart failure. Fewer than 1% of tests were ordered by obstetric and gynecologic services. Fewer than half (47%) of patients had confirmatory testing performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Discussion Four major hospitals systems in California and Texas demonstrated low overall rates of CD diagnostic testing, testing primarily among older patients with end-organ damage, and incomplete confirmatory testing. This suggests missed opportunities to diagnose CD in at-risk individuals early in the course of infection when antiparasitic treatment can reduce the risk of disease progression and prevent vertical transmission."

Following the administration of an educational intervention, the participants’ knowledge regarding vector transmission increased to 91% and 35% of participants were able to successfully identify images of the vector. Five participants screened positive for T. cruzi infection, indicating a 3.24% [95%CI: 1.1–7.5%] prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection within the Latin American community of the New Orleans area. Results highlight the urgent need for improving access to education and diagnostics of Chagas disease."

A total of 228 records were discovered, including 186 from historical or observation platforms and 42 specimens submitted to TAMU or CDC. Species included Triatoma sanguisuga (221 total records, 9 nymphs) and Triatoma lecticularia (7 records). Notably, nearly all (24/26) records submitted to TAMU were collected indoors. Twelve of the 30 (40%) specimens tested were positive for the presence of T. cruzi, including parasite discrete taxonomic units TcI and TcIV. One triatomine sample had been found in a bed feeding on the submitter; this bug was positive for T. cruzi and had evidence of human blood in its gut. Records suggest a ubiquitous distribution in Missouri and potentially to the northernmost border in Illinois. Further investigations into triatomine distribution and infection status are needed withinstatesassumed to be northern limits in order to create public health and veterinary health messaging and baseline distributional maps from which to measure future range shifts in relation to a changing climate."

Buckner.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20242,2023,"Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially fatal, chronic disease caused by infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan parasite. Chagas disease is recognized by the World Health Organization as one of the most neglected tropical diseases with 6–8 million cases and 50,000 resulting deaths per year (Rassi et al. 2010; WHO 2022). Humans and animals usually become infected with T. cruzi after being bitten by triatomine bugs, T. cruzi insect vectors that are often referred to as kissing or conenose bugs (Figure 1). Triatomine bugs infected with T. cruzi are only found in the Americas. Chagas disease cases caused by triatomine bug transmission generally occur in Mexico, Central America, and South America. However, this disease is becoming more recognized in non-endemic areas, such as theunitedstates, due to the migration of asymptomatic infected people to these areas (CDC 2022a). Currently, approximately 300,000 people are infected with Chagas disease in theunitedstates, with 18,000 of these individuals in Florida (Bern and Montgomery 2009; Levesque 2021; Irish et al. 2022). Additionally, approximately 75 suspected or confirmed human Chagas disease cases resulting from local transmission via triatomines were documented in theunitedstatesfrom 2000 to 2018 (Lynn et al. 2020). However, more research is needed to understand the true risk of transmission in areas of theunitedstateswhere triatomines are present. Awareness of Chagas disease and its vectors, transmission routes, symptoms, diagnoses, and treatments is critical in endemic and non-endemic areas of the world to ensure that Chagas disease cases are detected and treated early (Ramsey and Schofield 2003; Forsyth et al. 2022). This publication is intended for anyone interested in learning more about vector-borne transmission of T. cruzi and Chagas disease."

Non-Endemic Chagas Cardiomyopathy.,"Gorantla, A., M. Ramirez, A. Kishore, S. Sivakumar, N. Horton, A. Sultana, Z. Magdolen, B. Nigussie and A. S. Budzikowski.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20352,2023,"Background: Chagas disease (CD) is the most common cause of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy in Latin America. It is a progressive myocarditis with features of biventricular dysfunction, ventricular arrhythmias and thromboembolic complications. Data suggests that patients with acute Chagas disease can proceed to chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy without an intervening indeterminate phase. The objective of this paper is to describe a case where acute chagas disease progressed to chagas cardiomyopathy over 4 months in a young woman who visited the Bahamas, which has not been reported before. Case: Our patient is a 25-year-old woman who presented with shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance over the past 3 months. She visited the Bahamas 4 months ago during which she had multiple insect bites. Her vital signs were normal temperature, blood pressure of 153/101mmHg, HR of 97 and O2 saturation 100% on RA. Physical exam was positive for crackles and bilateral lower extremity edema. pro-BNP 459. Other labs sent included Trypanosoma cruzi IgG antibodies, HIV, SPEP. EKG showed with sinus rhythm without ischemic changes. Chest x-ray cardiomegaly. Patient received IV diuresis with furosemide and started on guideline directed medical treatment for new onset CHF. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed severely decreased EF of 20-25%, mildly dilated left ventricle with eccentric LVH and trivial pericardial effusion. Follow up labs demonstrated elevated Trypanosoma cruzi IgG antibodies 1.8 (ref range: <1). She was discharged with cardiology and infectious disease outpatient follow up. Decision-making: The specific differential characteristics of Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM) can be overlooked as it is a rare entity in theunitedstates. Conclusion: Recognizing non endemic cases and educating the patients to get screened is important as treatment with anti-trypanosomal drugs during the acute or early chronic phase can potentially cure Chagas disease and prevent heart failure and other sequelae of advanced CCM."
Unrecognized Sequelae of Climate Change: Chagas Disease.,"Kerling, D. and C. Murphy.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20427,2023,"Background: Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease and increased human migration and climate change has transformed what was previously a local problem into a major global health issue. We are now seeing increasing cases of cardiac conduction disturbances and cardiomyopathy secondary to Chagas disease in theunitedstates. Case: A 50 -year-old female presented to the emergency room at a major quaternary referral center in the Mid-Atlantic region with fatigue and was found to have new-onset high-degree atrioventricular block. She had no medical comorbidities and was on no medications. She also denied any travel outside of theunitedstates. She was admitted to the cardiology service for expedited work-up and close monitoring. Decision-making: An transthoracic echocardiogram was unremarkable. The patient underwent left heart catheterization to rule out “silent” coronary artery disease as etiology of conduction disturbances, which demonstrated patent coronary arteries. Prior to a pacemaker referral, a cardiac MRI was obtained as sarcoidosis and other infiltrative pathologies were on the differential. The MRI demonstrated late gadolinium enhancement consistent with epicardial scar in the inferiorlateral wall of the left ventricle. One of the treating physicians recognized the pattern as being characteristic of Chagas disease in the literature, and sent for the antibody test, which came back positive. Conclusion: Chagas disease is traditionally not thought to be present in the Mid-Atlantic region of theunitedstates, unless the patient has clear history of travel from an endemic region. However, Chagas disease should be on the differential for patients suspected of having infiltrative cardiac disease given its increased incidence in theunitedstates."
In the Clinic Chagas Disease.,"Hochberg, N. S. and S. P.

An estimated 240 000 to 350 000 persons in theunitedstatesare infected, primarily immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and South America, where the disease is endemic. The parasite is transmitted by the triatomine bug but can also be passed through blood transfusion, via organ transplant, or congenitally. Approximately 30% of infected persons later develop cardiac and/or gastrointestinal complications. Health care providers should consider screening at-risk patients with serologic testing. Early diagnosis and treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox can help prevent complications. Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a leading cause of parasitic infection in theunitedstates, with an estimated 240 000 to 350 000 cases (1, 2). In Latin America, an estimated 5.7 million people were infected in 2010 (3). About 1.2 million persons are affected by Chagas cardiomyopathy, and up to 12 000 deaths are estimated to be caused by Chagas disease each year (4, 5), mostly due to severe cardiac complications (6–9)."
Sensitivity analysis for causality in observational studies for regulatory science.,"Díaz, I., H. Lee, E. Kiciman, E. J. Schenck, M. Akacha, D. Follman and D. Ghosh.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20745,2023,"Objective: TheunitedstatesCongress passed the 21st Century Cures Act mandating the development of Food and Drug Administration guidance on regulatory use of real-world evidence. The Forum on the Integration of Observational and Randomized Data conducted a meeting with various stakeholder groups to build consensus around best practices for the use of real-world data (RWD) to support regulatory science. Our companion paper describes in detail the context and discussion of the meeting, which includes a recommendation to use a causal roadmap for study designs using RWD. This article discusses one step of the roadmap: the specification of a sensitivity analysis for testing robustness to violations of causal model assumptions. Methods: We present an example of a sensitivity analysis from a RWD study on the effectiveness of Nifurtimox in treating Chagas disease, and an overview of various methods, emphasizing practical considerations on their use for regulatory purposes. Results: Sensitivity analyses must be accompanied by careful design of other aspects of the causal roadmap. Their prespecification is crucial to avoid wrong conclusions due to researcher degrees of freedom. Sensitivity analysis methods require auxiliary information to produce meaningful conclusions; it is important that they have at least two properties: the validity of the conclusions does not rely on unverifiable assumptions, and the auxiliary information required by the method is learnable from the corpus of current scientific knowledge. Conclusions: Prespecified and assumption-lean sensitivity analyses are a crucial tool that can strengthen the validity and trustworthiness of effectiveness conclusions for regulatory science."
Ecological interactions of Triatoma sanguisuga (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) and risk for human infection with Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in Illinois and Louisiana.,"Dumonteil, E., W. Tu, F. A. Jiménez and C. Herrera.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20775,2024,"Triatoma sanguisuga (Leconte) is one of the most widely distributed kissing bugs in theunitedstates, associated with an extensive zoonotic circulation of Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, in a large part of the country. However, the actual risk for human infection in theunitedstatesis poorly understood. Here, we further assessed the ecology of T. sanguisuga bugs collected in residents houses in Illinois and Louisiana, using a metagenomic approach to identify their blood-feeding sources, T. cruzi parasites and gut microbiota. Blood meal analysis revealed feeding on domestic animals (dogs, cats, pigs, goats, and turkeys), synanthropic species (raccoons, opossums, and squirrels), as well as the more sylvatic white-tail deer. Human blood was identified in 11/14 (78%) of bugs, highlighting a frequent vector-human contact. The infection rate with T. cruzi was 53% (8/15), and most infected bugs (6/8) had fed on humans. A total of 41 bacterial families were identified, with significant differences in microbiota alpha and beta diversity between bugs from Louisiana and Illinois. However, predicted metabolic functions remained highly conserved, suggesting important constraints to fulfill their role in bug biology. These results confirmed a significant risk for vector-borne transmission of T. cruzi to humans in Louisiana and Illinois, which warrants more active screening for human infections. Also, while there is broad plasticity in the bacterial composition of T. sanguisuga microbiota, there are strong constraints to preserve metabolic profile and function, making it a good target for novel vector control strategies."

The bugs were identified as Triatoma sanguisuga, the most widespread triatomine bug species in theunitedstates. Triatoma sanguisuga is a competent vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The two specimens were tested via real-time PCR (qPCR) for infection with T. cruzi, and one of the specimens was positive. Despite T. sanguisuga being endemic to the area, attainment of accurate species identification and T. cruzi testing of the bugs required multiple calls to federal, state, private, and academic institutions over several months. This constitutes the first report of T. sanguisuga infected with T. cruzi in Delaware. In addition, this is the first published report of T. sanguisuga in New Castle County, the northernmost and most densely populated county in Delaware. New Castle County still conforms to the described geographic range of T. sanguisuga, which spans from Texas to the East Coast of theunitedstates. The T. cruzi infection prevalence of the species has not been studied in the northeasternunitedstates, but collections in southernstateshave found prevalences as high as 60%. The Delaware homeowners lengthy pursuit of accurate information about the vector highlights the need for more research on this important disease vector in Delaware."

Mexican free-tailed bats have a wide geographic range stretching from northern South America to the westernunitedstates. Bats are theorized to be the original hosts for Trypanosoma cruzi -the causative agent of Chagas disease- and can serve as a source of infection to triatomine insect vectors that feed upon them. Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease across the Americas where triatomines are present, including the southernunitedstates, where Texas reports this highest number of locally-acquired human cases. To learn more about the role of bats in the ecology of Chagas disease in Texas, we surveyed a colony of Mexican free-tailed bats from Brazos County, Texas, for T. cruzi using carcasses salvaged after an extreme weather event. A total of 283 Mexican free-tailed bats collected in February 2021 were dissected and DNA from the hearts and kidneys was used for T. cruzi detection via qPCR. None of the bat hearts or kidneys tested positive for T. cruzi; this sample size affords 95% confidence that the true prevalence of T. cruzi in this population does not exceed 1%. Future sampling of multiple bat species as well as migrant and resident colonies of Mexican free-tailed bats across different times of the year over a broader geographic range would be useful in learning more about the role of bats in the ecology of Chagas disease in Texas."
In vitro diagnostic methods of Chagas disease in the clinical laboratory: a scoping review.,"Ascanio, L. C., S. Carroll, A. Paniz-Mondolfi and J. D. Ramírez.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20956,2024,"Background: Chagas disease (CD), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is a global health concern with expanding geographical reach. Despite improved and accessible test methods, diagnosing CD in its various phases remains complex. The existence of clinical scenarios, including immunosuppressed patients, transplant-related CD reactivation, transfusion-associated cases, and orally transmitted acute infections, adds to the diagnostic challenge. No singular gold standard test exists for all phases, and recommendations from PAHO and the CDC advocate for the use of two serological methods for chronic CD diagnosis, while molecular methods or direct parasite detection are suggested for the acute phase. Given the complexity in the diagnostic landscape of CD, the goal of this scoping review is to characterize available diagnostic tests for CD in the clinical laboratory. Methods: A literature search in PubMed was conducted on studies related to In vitro diagnosis (IVD) in humans published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese language as of 28 August 2023, and extended backward with no predefined time frame. Studies underwent title and abstract screening, followed by full-text review. Studies included were classified based on the diagnostic method used. Test methods were grouped as serological, molecular, and other methods. Performance, availability, and regulatory status were also characterized. Results: Out of 85 studies included in the final review, 115 different tests were identified. These tests comprised 89 serological test types, 21 molecular test types, and 5 other test methods. Predominant serological tests included ELISA (38 studies, 44.70%), Rapid tests (19 studies, 22.35%), and chemiluminescence (10 studies, 11.76%). Among molecular tests, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays were notable. Twenty-eight tests were approved globally for IVD or donor testing, all being serological methods. Molecular assays lacked approval for IVD in theunitedstates, with only European and Colombian regulatory acceptance. Discussion and conclusion: Serological tests, specifically ELISAs, remain the most used and commercially available diagnostic methods. This makes sense considering that most Chagas disease diagnoses occur in the chronic phase and that the WHO gold standard relies on 2 serological tests to establish the diagnosis of chronic Chagas. ELISAs are feasible and relatively low-cost, with good performance with sensitivities ranging between 77.4% and 100%, and with specificities ranging between 84.2% and 100%. Molecular methods allow the detection of specific variants but rely on the parasites presence, which limits their utility to parasitemia levels. Depending on the PCR method and the phase of the disease, the sensitivity ranged from 58.88 to 100% while the mean specificity ranged from 68.8% to 100%. Despite their performance, molecular testing remains mostly unavailable for IVD use. Only 3 molecular tests are approved for IVD, which are available only in Europe. Six commercial serological assays approved by the FDA are available for blood and organ donor screening. Currently, there are no guidelines for testing CD oral outbreaks. Although more evidence is needed on how testing methods should be used in special clinical scenarios, a comprehensive approach of clinical assessment and diagnostics tests, including not IVD methods, is required for an accurate CD diagnosis."
A scoping review of triatomine control for Chagas disease prevention: current and developing tools in Latin America and the United States.,"Tian, Y., C. Durden and G. L. Hamer.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20970,2024,"Chagas disease is an infectious disease of human and animal health concern, with 6-8 million chronic human infections and over 50,000 deaths throughout the Americas annually. Hematophagous insects of the subfamily Triatominae, also called kissing bugs, vector the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas (Trypanosomatida: Trypanosomatidae), that causes Chagas disease. Despite the large human health burden, Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease with inadequate funding for research and preventive practices. Given the resource-poor environment of most agencies trying to protect public health, it is critical to consider all control options for reducing vector populations and the risk of human exposure to T. cruzi to identify the most appropriate tools for each context. While numerous triatomine control methods exist, the literature lacks a compilation of the strategies used, a critical examination of their efficiency, and a particular focus on triatomine control in theunitedstatescompared to elsewhere in the Americas. Here, we present a review of the literature to assess historical intervention strategies of existing and developing triatomine control methods. For each method, we discuss progress in the field, future research to further advance the method, and limitations. While we found that pyrethroid insecticide is still the most commonly used method of triatomine and Chagas disease control, we suggest that complementing these techniques with alternative control methods in development will help to achieve Chagas disease reduction goals."

The genetic structure of the species is divided into seven distinct genetic groups, TcI to TcVI, and Tcbat, which have shown differences in terms of geographic distribution, biological properties, and susceptibility to drugs. However, the association between genetic variability and clinical forms of ChD has not yet been fully elucidated. The predominance of TcII and TcVI discrete typing units (DTUs) (genetic groups) is known to occur in several Brazilian regions and is associated with both the domestic and the wild cycles of ChD. Thus, this study aimed to verify the genotypes of the parasites present in 330 patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) from different Brazilianstatesattended at the Clinical Hospital of the Ribeirão Preto Medical School and to assess the existence of a correlation between the clinical forms with the main cardiovascular risk factors and the genetics of the parasite. Methodology Principal findings All patients with CCC were clinically evaluated through anamnesis, physical examination, biochemical tests, 12-lead electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and chest X-ray. Peripheral blood (5 mL) was collected in guanidine/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid from each patient for DNA extraction and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Chagas disease and genotyping of the parasite in the 7 DTUs. Parasite genotyping was performed using conventional multilocus PCR. Samples of only 175 patients were positive after amplification of the specific genes contained in the T. cruzi genotyping criteria. TcII (64/175), TcVI (9/175), and TcI (3/175) DTUs were predominant, followed by TcII/TcV/TcVI (74/175), and TcII/TcVI (23/ 175). The TcIII and TcIV DTU´s was detected in only one sample of CCC patients. Conclusions/Significance Our data corroborate previous findings, indicating the predominance of the TcII genotype in patients with CCC of Brazilian origin. Moreover, this study pioneered disclosing a direct correlation between the TcII DTU and severe CCC."
Differentiating Trypanosoma cruzi in a Host Mammalian Cell Imaged in Aqueous Liquid by Atmospheric Scanning Electron Microscopy.,"Takagi, Y., M. Sato, M. Naya and C. Sato.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=15701,2022,"Atmospheric Scanning Electron Microscopy (ASEM) is a powerful tool to observe a wet specimen at high resolution under atmospheric pressure. Here, we visualized a protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi over the course of its infection cycle in the host mammalian cell. This is the first observation of intracellular parasite using a liquidphase EM. Unlike regular SEM, aldehyde-fixed cell body of T. cruzi appears translucent, allowing the visualization of internal structures such as kinetoplast of trypomastigote and nucleus of amastigote. Plasma membrane of the host mammalian cell also appears translucent, which enabled direct observation of differentiating intracellular parasites and dynamic change of host cellular structures in their near-naturalstates. Various water-rich structures including micro- and macro- vesicles were visualized around T. cruzi. In addition, Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy exploiting open sample dish of ASEM allowed identification of parasite nucleus and transfected fluorescence-labeled parasites soon after internalization, while location of this morphological intermediate was otherwise obscure. Successful visualization of the differentiation of T. cruzi within the host cell demonstrated here opens up the possibility of using ASEM for observation of variety of intracellular parasites."

Barbosa Marcon.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=19158,2023,"In Brazil, blood donation is regulated by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and allstatesfollow the same protocol for clinical and laboratory screening. Brazil is an endemic country for Chagas disease (CD), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, and for leishmaniasis, caused by a species of Leishmania spp. Screening for leishmaniosis is not routinely performed by blood banks. Given the antigenic similarity between T. cruzi and Leishmania spp., cross-reactions in serological tests can occur, and inconclusive results for CD have been found. The objective of this study was to apply molecular techniques, e.g., nPCR, PCR, and qPCR, to clarify cases of blood donation candidates with non-negative serology for CD and to analyze the difference between the melting temperature during real-time PCR using SYBR Green. Thirty-seven cases that showed non-negative results for CD using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) tests from blood banks in Campo Grande, MS, and Campinas, SP, were analyzed. In the serum samples, 35 samples were evaluated by ELISA, and 24.3% (9/35) showed positive results for CD. nPCR was able to detect 12 positive results in 35 samples (34.28%). qPCR for T. cruzi was quantifiable in the samples that showed a value 0.002 par eq/mL (parasite equivalents per milliliter), and in 35 samples, 11 (31.42%) were positive. Of all evaluated samples using the described tests (CMIA, ELISA, nPCR, and qPCR), 18 (48.6%) were positive for CD. For MCA by qPCR, the melting temperature was 82.06 C  0.46 for T. cruzi and 81.9 C  0.24 for Leishmania infantum. The Mann–Whitney test showed a significant value of p < 0.0001. However, the differentiation between T. cruzi and L. infantum could not be considered due to temperature overlap. For leishmaniasis, of the 35 samples with non-negative serology for CD tested by the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), only one sample (2.85%) was positive (1:80). The PCR for Leishmania spp. was performed on 36 blood samples from donation candidates, and all were negative. qPCR for L. infantum showed 37 negative results for the 37 analyzed samples. The data presented here show the importance of performing two different tests in CD screening at blood banks. Molecular tests should be used for confirmation, thereby improving the blood donation system."
Bayesian Spatiotemporal Projection of Chagas Disease Incidence in Brazil.,"Roubenoff, E.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=18818,2023,"Chagas Disease is a parasitic infection caused by the T. Cruzi parasite endemic to Central and South America and transmitted through contact with Triatomine insects, commonly known as “kissing bugs.” Although the symptoms of Acute Chagas Disease (ACD) are nonspecific, untreated chronic infection can lead to heart disease, enlarged esophagus and colon, and stroke. Chagas disease has become increasingly rare owing to a series of public health interventions, including insect eradication campaigns in Brazil through the 1980’s that considerably reduced the number of new acute cases. However, hundreds of new acute cases still are diagnosed annually, primarily in thestatesof Pará, Amapá, and Acre. Moreover, the population in areas of high Chagas endemicity are changing: many areas are growing and becoming increasingly urban, whereas others are decreasing in population. We estimate the Incidence Rate (IR) for Acute Chagas disease over the period 2001-2019 in Brazil at the municipal level and investigate the variation of these rates with climatic factors. These estimates are used to project forward incidence of Acute Chagas Disease over the following decade 2020-2029. Modeling ACD presents numerous methodological challenges since incidence is rare, with extreme overdispersion of zero-case counts, and vectors exhibit a highly spatially- and temporally-clustered pattern. We use a spatially- and temporally-autoregressive small-area smoothing models to estimate the true latent risk in developing Acute Chagas Disease. The Bayesian model presented here involves spatio-temporal smoothing via a Zero-Inflated (Lambert 1992), Knorr-Held (2000)-Type spatio-temporal model with a BYM2 (Morris, 2019) spatial convolution to predict smoothed incidence rates of Chagas disease. As well, we include estimates of Brazil’s growing population and projected bioclimate to evaluate how climate and population change may affect ACD rates. We estimate that cases will continue to increase in the absence of control efforts, primarily driven by a growing peri-urban population in regions of Chagas endemicity."

Results There was a total of 4,376 HAs due to CD that resulted in death and 122,275 deaths from CD. The Southeast region recorded the highest proportions and rates of HAs resulting in death (63.9%, n = 2,796; 0.17/100,000 inhabitants), and overall deaths from CD (51.0%, n = 62,308; 3.79/100,000 inhabitants). The highest risk of CD-related death was found in males (Relative risk RR 1.27) and Afro-Brazilians (RR 1.63). There was an increase in hospital mortality from CD (Average Annual Percent Change AAPC 7.5, 95% Confidence Interval CI 5.3 to 9.9), and stability in the North, Northeast and Southeast regions. For CD-related mortality, a decrease was observed in the country (AAPC . 0.7%, 95%CI -0.9 to -0.5), with an increase in the Northeast region (AAPC 1.1%, 95%CI 0.6 to 1.6). Municipalities with a very high Brazilian Deprivation Index tended to show increased mortality (AAPC 2.1%, 95%CI 1.6 to 2.7), while the others showed a decrease. Conclusion Hospital case fatality and specific mortality due to CD are a relevant public health problem in Brazil. Differences related to gender, ethnicity, and social vulnerability reinforce the need for comprehensive care, and to ensure equity in access to health in the country. Municipalities,states, and regions with indicators that reveal higher morbidity and mortality need to be prioritized."

With a re-emergence in Venezuela during the past two decades, the spread of CD has proved susceptible to, and inhibitable by a digital, real-time surveillance system effectuated by Citizen Scientists in communities throughout the country. The #TraeTuChipo (#BringYourKissingBug) campaign implemented in January 2020, has served as such a strategy counting on community engagement to define the current ecological distribution of CD vectors despite the absence of a functional national surveillance program. This pilot campaign collected data through online surveys, social media platforms, and/or telephone text messages. A total of 79 triatomine bugs were reported from eighteen Venezuelanstates; 67 bugs were identified as Panstrongylus geniculatus, 1 as Rhodnius pictipes, 1 as Triatoma dimidiata, and 10 as Triatoma maculata. We analyzed 8 triatomine feces samples spotted from 4 Panstrongylus geniculatus which were confirmed positive by qPCR for T. cruzi. Further molecular characterization of discrete typing units (DTUs), revealed that all samples contained TcI, the most highly diverse and broadly distributed strain of T. cruzi. Moreover, analysis of the mitochondrial 12S gene revealed Myotis keaysi, Homo sapiens, and Gallus gallus as the main triatomine feeding sources. This study highlights a novel Citizen Science approach which may help improve the surveillance systems for CD in endemic countries."
European priority review vouchers for neglected disease product development.,"Ridley , D. B., A. M. Lasanta, F. S. Jones and S. K. Ridley.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=18822,2024,"Introduction Neglected diseases are a significant global health challenge. Encouraging the development of therapeutics and vaccines for these diseases would address an important unmet medical need. We propose a priority review voucher programme for the European Union (EU). The developer of a drug or vaccine for a neglected disease would receive a voucher for accelerated assessment of a different product at the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Methods This study uses retrospective observational data to estimate the potential commercial value of the proposed voucher programme using a five-step approach: (1) estimating the time saved in the EMA accelerated regulatory review; (2) gauging time reductions in accelerated pricing and reimbursement decisions by EU memberstates; (3) selecting 10 high-revenue products launched between 2015 and 2020 representing typical voucher users; (4) analysing IQVIA MIDAS sales data for the selected products and (5) calculating the net present value (NPV) of the voucher based on the 10 products. Results The accelerated EMA review would reduce regulatory time by an average of 182 days. Additionally, products could save more than a year in many memberstatesthrough an expedited 120-day pricing and reimbursement review. The estimated NPV of regulatory acceleration by two quarters would be €100 million. In addition, if France, Italy and Spain reviewed pricing and reimbursement in only 120 days, then the value would double. Conclusion An EU voucher estimated at more than 100 million, coupled with a USS100 million counterpart, offers a meaningful incentive for novel product development. However, the voucher programme should be part of a comprehensive strategy for tackling neglected diseases, rather than a standalone solution."

Currently there are seven discrete typing units (DTUs) of T. cruzi distributed in America, but there are still gaps about its distribution in some endemic regions.  Materials and Methods: Seventeen units isolated from Chiapas and Oaxaca in Mexico were identified by amplification of the C-5 sterol desaturase gene.  Results: Three DTUs of T. cruzi, TcI (6), TcII (10), and TcIV (1) were detected by comparing polymorphic sites in specific regions.  Conclusions: New DTUs are reported for bothstates, where TcII was the most common DTU. The genetic characterization of the isolates can help to understand the epidemiology of Chagas disease."

Here, we studied the role of host competence, geographic area provenance, and diversity of vector-host interactions as drivers of wild mammal infection risk to Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease. We performed a systematic sampling of wild mammals in 11statesof Mexico, from 2017 to 2018. We tested the positivity of T. cruzi with the Tc24 marker in tissues samples for 61 wild mammal species (524 specimens sampled). 26 mammal species were positive for T. cruzi, of which 11 are new hosts recorded in Mexico 75 specimens were positive and 449 were negative for T. cruzi infection, yielding an overall prevalence of 14.3%. The standardized infection risk of T. cruzi of our examined specimens was similar, no matter the host species or their geographic origins. Additionally, we used published data of mammal positives for T. cruzi to complement records of T. cruzi infection in wild mammals and inferred a trophic network of Triatoma spp. (vectors) and wild mammal species in Mexico, using spatial data-mining modelling. Infection with T. cruzi was not homogeneously distributed in the inferred trophic network. This information allowed us to develop a predictive model for T. cruzi infection risk for wild mammals in Mexico, considering risk as a function of the diversity of vector-host spatial associations in a large-scale geographic context, finding that the addition of competent vectors to a multi-host parasite system amplifies host infection risk. The diversity of vector-host interactions per se constitutes a relevant driver of infection risk because hosts and vectors are not isolated from each other."
Stroke in Chagas disease: from pathophysiology to clinical practice.,"Reis Lage, T. A., J. Teixeira Tupinambás, L. Bretas de Pádua, M. de Oliveira Ferreira, A. C. Ferreira, A. L. Teixeira and M. C. Pereira Nunes.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20139,2022,"Despite substantial progress toward its control, Chagas disease continues to be a major public health problem in Latin America and has become a global health concern. The disease affects approximately 6 million people, of whom 20–40% will develop cardiomyopathy over the years after the initial Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Chagas cardiomyopathy is the most serious and frequent manifestation of Chagas disease. Clinical manifestations vary widely according to the severity of myocardial dysfunction, ranging from asymptomatic to severe forms, including dilated cardiomyopathy with heart failure, arrhythmias, thromboembolism events, and sudden death. Chagas disease is a risk factor for stroke regardless of the severity of cardiomyopathy, which is a leading cause of chronic disability. Classically, stroke etiology in patients with Chagas disease is thought to be cardioembolic and related to apical aneurysm, mural thrombus, and atrial arrhythmias. Although most strokes are thromboembolic, other etiologies have been observed. Small vessel disease, atherosclerosis, and cryptogenic diseases have been reported in patients with Chagas disease and stroke. The potential mechanisms involved in non-embolic strokes include the presence of associated risk factors, pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic diseasestates, and endothelial dysfunction. However, the contribution of each mechanism to stroke in Chagas disease remains unclear. The review aims to provide an overview of stroke in Chagas disease, highlighting the main pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical presentation, approaches for prevention, and unanswered questions regarding treatment strategies."

Hasslocher-Moreno.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=19181,2023,"Background: Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected endemic disease with worldwide impact due to migration. Approximately 50–70% of individuals in the chronic phase of CD present the indeterminate form, characterized by parasitological and/or serological evidence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, but without clinical signs and symptoms. Subclinical abnormalities have been reported in indeterminate form of CD, including pro-inflammatorystatesand alterations in cardiac function, biomarkers and autonomic modulation. Moreover, individuals with CD are usually impacted on their personal and professional life, making social insertion difficult and impacting their mental health and quality of life (QoL). Physical exercise has been acknowledged as an important strategy to prevent and control numerous chronic-degenerative diseases, but unexplored in individuals with the indeterminate form of CD. The PEDI-CHAGAS study (which stands for “Home-Based Exercise Program in the Indeterminate Form of Chagas Disease” in Portuguese) aims to evaluate the effects of a home-based exercise program on physical and mental health outcomes in individuals with indeterminate form of CD. Methods and design: The PEDI-CHAGAS is a two-arm (exercise and control) phase 3 superiority randomized clinical trial including patients with indeterminate form of CD. The exclusion criteria are <18 years old, evidence of non-Chagasic cardiomyopathy, musculoskeletal or cognitive limitations that preclude the realization of exercise protocol, clinical contraindication for regular exercise, and regular physical exercise (1 per week). Participants will be assessed at baseline, and after three and 6 months of followup. The primary outcome will be QoL. Secondary outcomes will include blood pressure, physical fitness components, nutritional status, fatigability, autonomic modulation, cardiac morphology and function, low back pain, depression and anxiety, stress, sleep quality, medication use and adherence, and biochemical, inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers. Participants in the intervention group will undergo a home-based exercise program whilst those in the control group will receive only general information regarding the benefits of physical activity. Both groups will receive the same general nutritional counseling consisting of general orientations about healthy diets. Conclusion: The findings from the present study may support public health intervention strategies to improve physical and mental health parameters to be implemented more effectively in this population."

Computational quantum chemical calculations provided the normal modes of vibrations, the global chemical reactivity parameters, the most probable regions for electrophilic and nucleophilic reactive at- tacks, and the singletstatesfor BNZTHP chalcone. Regarding the activity against T. cruzi the compound exhibited more active on trypomastigote than epimastigote forms with lower toxic on LLC-MK2 host cells. Furthermore, it presented a more powerful inhibitory effect than benznidazole. From the molecular dock- ing studies showed that trypomastigote forms were able to interact with the cruzain, trypanothione re- ductase, and TcGAPDH enzymes, indicating good affinity toward the active pocket.

Since the pacemaker or cardioverter-defibrillator has become a highly relevant agent for treating these arrhythmias and Brazil has endemic areas for this infectious disease, the need to investigate its correlations becomes undeniable. This work aims to evaluate the prevalence and clinicalepidemiological profile of CD in individuals needing artificial cardiac stimulation in a tertiary service. Methods: Crosssectional observation study with 65 patients undergoing the device implantation procedure at Hospital do Coração de Natal [Heart Hospital from Natal (RN - Brazil)], from July 13/2022 to March 31/2023. The variables gender, age, origin, clinical conditions, knowledge about Triatomineus, and Anti-Trypanosoma Cruzi IgG antibody results were used to characterize the studied population. Data were collected using a specific form previously authorized by the Ethics Committee and with informed consent. Results: It was observed that 56% of those interviewed were elderly, and 18% were under 60 years of age. 69% come from the east zone of Rio Grande do Norte (RN), followed by users from the central region (12%), rural (12%) and western (6%) of Rio Grande do Norte (RN), with only 1% from otherstatesin Brazil. Regarding the associated pathologies of this group of patients, 64.6% of those interviewed were hypertensive (SAH), 27.6% are or were smokers and 24.6% had Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Regarding the diagnosis, 86% was demonstrated by electrocardiogram, in which 50.7% presented total atrioventricular block (CAVB). In addition, 05 patients (7.7%) had reactive anti-Trypanosoma Cruzi IgG antibodies, 02 of which were under 60 years of age. 02 patients came from the west zone of Rio Grande do Norte, 02 from the east zone and 01 from the central zone of RN. From this perspective, 33.8% of those interviewed stated that they had already had contact with this insect, while 66.2 had not. Conclusion: The clinical-epidemiological profile was men, elderly, from all over RN, smokers and /or people with DM and or SAH, with an electrocardiographic diagnosis of atrioventricular blocks, predominantly AVB. Furthermore, a low prevalence of Chagas disease was observed in these patients, as well as little self-declared contact with the triatomine.

We also estimated the potential impact of misclassification on the number of deaths attributed to ChD. Study design: Population-based descriptive study. Methods: We used the Mortality Information System (SIM; in Portuguese) data before and after routine GC investigation in 2015e2019 to evaluate ChD deaths detected among them.We identified priority GCs, which contributed more than 0.1 % to the percentage of total ChD deaths registered. Spearman's correlation was used to evaluate the association between the reclassification of priority GCs and ChD prevalence. Then, we applied the GC correction factors to estimate the number of deaths attributed to ChD. Results: 22,154 deaths were reported as ChD in the study period. Among them, 1004 deaths originally listed as priority GCs were deaths reclassified to ChD after an investigation in the SIM final database. Unspecific cardiomyopathy (10.2 %), unspecific heart diseases (4.7 %), and heart failure (2.8 %) were GCs with the highest proportions of reclassification to ChD in Brazil. Higher ChD prevalence at the state level was associated with a higher proportion of GC deaths reclassified as ChD. When applying correction factors identified after investigation, we estimated an increase of 26.4 % in registered ChD deaths, mostly instateswith higher endemicity. Conclusions: GCs might conceal deaths due to ChD, particularly in Brazil'sstateswith higher endemicity. The approach suggested in this study may offer an alternative method for estimating ChD-related deaths in endemic countries."

The aim of this article is to tell the story of their activism, highlighting key historical experiences and successful initiatives, from 1909 to 2019. The first association was created in 1987, in the city of Recife, Brazil. So far, thirty associations have been reported on five continents. They were created as independent non-profit civil society organisations and run democratically by affected people. Among the common associations’ objectives, we notably find: increase the visibility of the affected; make their voice heard; build bridges between patients, health system professionals, public health officials, policy makers and the academic and scientific communities. The International Federation of Associations of People Affected by CD - FINDECHAGAS, created in 2010 with the input of the Americas, Europe and the Western Pacific, counts as one of the main responses to the globalisation of CD. Despite all the obstacles and difficulties encountered, the Federation has thrived, grown, and matured.

This study aimed to describe CD vector control actions carried out in the 123 municipalities in Minas Gerais classified as at high risk of triatomine reinfestation in household units. An electronic form was sent to the municipal managers of the Regional Health Managements of Januária, Pedra Azul, Pirapora, Unaí and the Regional Health Superintendence of Montes Claros. The information was compiled, processed and analyzed in Excel. There was a 100% return on completed forms. The moment when control actions began was reported for 77.2% of the municipalities, with 82% of them starting in the 2000s. In 81.3% of the municipalities in the area there was at least one stoppage in control actions. vector control. Currently, at least one control action is being carried out in 63.4% of municipalities, the most frequent of which is surveillance with popular participation through Triatomine Information Posts. In 65% of the municipalities there were Endemic Disease Control Agents (ACEs) working with vector control actions and in 66% there was an endemic disease coordinator. Regarding professional training, 66% of ACEs who work with CD and 47% of coordinators underwent training focused on CD and triatomines. This exploratory study outlined a situational diagnosis of CD prevention and control actions currently carried out in municipalities with the highest risk of home reinfestation of triatomines in MG.

The taxonomy of this triatomine has been quite unstable: it was initially described as Eutriatoma tibiamaculata. Later, the species was transferred from the genus Eutriatoma to Triatoma. Although included in the genus Triatoma, the phylogenetic position of T. tibiamaculata in relation to other species of this genus has always been uncertain once this triatomine was grouped in all phylogenies with the genus Panstrongylus, rescuing T. tibiamaculata and P. megistus as sister species. Thus, we evaluated the generic status of T. tibiamaculata using phylogenetic and chromosomal analysis. Methods: Chromosomal (karyotype) and phylogenetic (with mitochondrial and nuclear markers) analyses were performed to assess the relationship between T. tibiamaculata and Panstrongylus spp. Results: The chromosomal and phylogenetic relationship of T. tibiamaculata and Panstrongylus spp. confirms the transfer of the species to Panstrongylus with the new combination: Panstrongylus tibiamaculatus. Conclusions: Based on chromosomal and phylogenetic characteristics, we state that P. tibiamaculatus comb. nov. belongs to the genus Panstrongylus and that the morphological features shared with Triatoma spp. represent homoplasies."
"The epidemiological importance of Panstrongylus megistus (Burmeister, 1835) (Hemiptera, Reduviidae, Triatominae) in the transmission of Chagas disease.","Faria Lemos Brighenti, B., J. de Oliveira, J.

Chagas disease (1909), described by Carlos Chagas, is a neglected illness with high incidence in the Americas. It is estimated that around 6 to 7 million people are affected, leading to the death of another 10 thousand annually. The transmission of Chagas disease occurs mainly through the feces of triatomines (insects commonly known as 'kissing bugs') infected with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent. One of its main vectors is Panstrongylus megistus, present in most Brazilianstatesand holding high rates of T. cruzi infection. This chapter aims to conduct a review on the epidemiological importance of P. megistus in the transmission of Chagas disease, addressing crucial data for disease control, such as the geographical distribution of the vector and its domiciliation capacity. Additionally, it provides information on symptoms, transmission, treatment, and diagnosis of Chagas disease. Keywords: Triatominae, domiciliation, epidemiology and P. megistus. RESUMO. A doença de Chagas (1909), descrita por Carlos Chagas, é uma doença negligenciada de grande incidência nas Américas. Estima-se que cerca de 6 a 7 milhões de pessoas são afetadas levando a morte outras 10 mil por ano. A transmissão da doença de Chagas ocorre principalmente por meio das fezes de triatomíneos (insetos conhecidos popularmente por 'barbeiros') infectadas pelo protozoário Tryapnosoma cruzi, agente etiológico. Um de seus principais vetores é Panstrongylus megistus, presente na maioria dos estados brasileiros e que detém altas taxas de infecção por T. cruzi. O presente capítulo tem como objetivo realizar uma revisão acerca da importância epidemiológica de P. megistus para a transmissão da doença de Chagas, abordando dados importantes para o controle da doença, como a distribuição geográfica do vetor e sua capacidade de domiciliação, além de informações sobre sintomatologia, transmissão, tratamento e diagnóstico da doença de Chagas.

Cases of autochthonous infections in the U.S. are not accurately tracked (Bennett et al. 2018, Valdez-Tah and Ibarra-Cerdena 2021). Although California has the highest number of residents living with Chagas disease in the U.S., it is still not a reportable disease in California, except in Los Angeles. Thus, continuing surveillance of Chagas disease infection among local populations of kissing bugs in all of California is important for accurate assessment of the public health risk and threat. In addition, we are concerned that Chagas disease may become more common in California and the rest of the U.S. in the future as climate change affects habitats and environments."

State and NGO coproduction of health care in the Gran Chaco.,"Falleti, T. G., S. L. Cunial, S. Bonczok Sotelo and F. Crudo.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20792,2024,"The collaboration between state and civil society in the delivery of public services is paramount to sustainable and participatory development in rural areas with marginalized populations. Previous research identified complementarity and embeddedness as two essential features of successful coproduction. However, most of the literature on coproduction studies users and providers who share the same language and culture, even if power asymmetries are high. We combine the literatures on non-state social welfare provision and on coproduction to analyze a collaboration betweenstatesand non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in multicultural and multilingual contexts. In such contexts, we argue, embeddedness requires not only language interpreters but also intercultural policies and training, without which the benefits of coproduction are lost in translation. Our study is based on a recent collaboration between thestatesof Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay and two health care NGOs that provide prenatal care to women in the Gran Chaco. In this region, a large portion of the population is Indigenous and maternal and infant mortality are high. Based on participant observation and in-depth interviews, combined with observational data, we analyze the experiences of public health care providers and NGO doctors involved in the intervention. We evaluate if there is complementarity between the state and the NGOs regarding access to preventive health care, diagnosis and treatment, and human resources in the health sector. Finally, we analyze whether state or NGO actors are embedded in local civil society or Indigenous communities. We find that this medical intervention significantly improves access to and delivery of health care to pregnant women, and promotes attention to neglected diseases such as Chagas. It also improves local human resources in the health sector. Despite these benefits, it lacks an intercultural approach to health care, limiting its potential, but also opening new opportunities for future research and practice."

The host immune response plays a pivotal role in disease progression. Ig isotypes may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Investigating these components can provide insights into the immunopathogenic mechanisms underlying CD. This cross-sectional study aims to establish a correlation between the Ig profile of individuals infected with T. cruzi with the clinical forms of chronic CD. Serum samples were collected from partner institutions in differentstatesof Brazil. Individuals diagnosed with chronic CD were categorized based on the clinical form of the disease. The indirect ELISA method using the recombinant chimeric Molecular Biology Institute of Parana membrane protein 8.4 as the antigen was used to determine the Ig profile, including total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. Ninety-seven serum samples from patients classified as negative (NEG, n 5 38), indeterminate (IND, n 5 24), mild cardiac (MC, n 5 20), and severe cardiac (SC, n 5 15) forms were analyzed. IgG1 exhibited greater levels compared with the other isotypes, showing a significant difference between the MC and IND groups. IgG3 levels were greater in individuals from the MC group compared with the SC group. IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes can serve as biomarkers to evaluate the progression of CD because they exhibit variations across clinical groups. Additional longitudinal studies are necessary to explore the relationship between antibody kinetics and the development of tissue damage."

It is estimated that around 6 million people are currently infected with the parasite in Latin America, and 25 million live in endemic areas with active transmission. The disease causes an estimated economic loss of USD 24 billion dollars annually, with a loss of 75,200 working years per year of life; it is responsible for around ~12,000 deaths annually. Although Mexico is an endemic country that recorded 10,186 new cases of Chagas disease during the period of 1990–2017, few studies have evaluated the genetic diversity of genes that could be involved in the prophylaxis and/or diagnosis of the parasite. One of the possible candidates proposed as a vaccine target is the 24 kDa trypomastigote excretory–secretory protein, Tc24, whose protection is linked to the stimulation of T. cruzi-specific CD8+ immune responses. (2) Methods: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the fine-scale genetic diversity and structure of Tc24 in T. cruzi isolates from Mexico, and to compare them with other populations reported in the Americas with the aim to reconsider the potential role of Tc24 as a key candidate for the prophylaxis and improvement of the diagnosis of Chagas disease in Mexico. (3) Results: Of the 25 Mexican isolates analysed, 48% (12) were recovered from humans and 24% (6) recovered from Triatoma barberi and Triatoma dimidiata. Phylogenetic inferences revealed a polytomy in the T. cruzi clade with two defined subgroups, one formed by all sequences of the DTU I and the other formed by DTU II–VI; both subgroups had high branch support. Genetic population analysis detected a single (monomorphic) haplotype of TcI throughout the entire distribution across both Mexico and South America. This information was supported by Nei’s pairwise distances, where the sequences of TcI showed no genetic differences. (4) Conclusions: Given that both previous studies and the findings of the present work confirmed that TcI is the only genotype detected from human isolates obtained from variousstatesof Mexico, and that there is no significant genetic variability in any of them, it is possible to propose the development of in silico strategies for the production of antigens that optimise the diagnosis of Chagas disease, such as quantitative ELISA methods that use this region of Tc24."

This triatomine species occurs in central Mexico, but little is known about its genetic variability. Using Cyt-b gene as a genetic marker, in this study, we determined the population genetic structure of T. mexicana collected from thestatesof Hidalgo, Guanajuato, and Queretaro where populations are largely peridomiciliary. A Bayesian approach was performed for the design of phylogenies, median-joining networks, and clustering among populations of T. mexicana. Our results show that the Hidalgo population was the most distinct, with the highest genetic and haplotypic variation (Hd = 0.963,  = 0.06129, and  = 0.05469). Moderate gene flow (Nm) was determined among populations of Hidalgo and Queretaro. Populations from the threestatesshowed differentiation (FST) values ranging from 0.22 to 0.3, suggesting an important genetic differentiation. The phylogenetic analysis showed the presence of five well-defined groups, as well as the haplotype network, where 24 haplotypes were observed forming five haplogroups with high mutational steps among them: 68 (Hgo-W2), 26 (Qto), 59 (Hgo-M), 44 (Hgo-W1), and 46 (Gto). Genetic isolation was apparently inferred in the Guanajuato population; however, the Mantel test did not show correlation between genetic (FST) and geographic (km) distances (p = 0.05). The STRU CTU RE analyses showed seven genetic clusters and it was observed that a single cluster predominates in each sampled location. However, genetic admixture was detected in four localities. Our results show evidence that there are multiple species within the collected sampling area."

Susceptibility to infection and vector competence depend on the parasite-vector relationship. Our objective was to evaluate the interaction between T. cruzi and these two triatomine vectors in pure and mixed experimental infections of T. cruzi strains from the same or different geographic regions.  Methods Fifth-instar nymphs of R. robustus and R. pictipes were fed on mice infected with four T. cruzi strains, namely genotypes TcIAM, TcIMG, TcIIPR, and TcIVAM, respectively, from the Brazilianstatesof Amazonas, Minas Gerais and Paraná. Over a period of 120 days, excreta were examined every 20 days to assess vector competence, and intestinal contents (IC) were examined every 30 days to determine susceptibility to infection.  Results The highest positive rate in the fresh examination (%+FE, 30.0%), the highest number of parasitic forms (PF, n = 1969) and the highest metacyclogenesis rate (%MC, 53.8%) in the excreta were recorded for R. robustus/TcIVAM. Examination of the IC of R. pictipes revealed a higher number of PF in infections with TcIAM (22,680 PF) and TcIIPR (19,845 PF) alone or in association (17,145 PF), as well as a %+FE of 75.0% with TcII, in comparison with the other genotypes. The highest %MC (100%) was recorded for the mixed infections of TcIAM with TcIIPR or TcIVAM in the IC of R. pictipes.  Conclusions Overall, both species were found to be susceptible to the T. cruzi strains studied. Rhodnius robustus showed vector competence for genotypes TcIVAM and TcIAM+TcIVAM and R. pictipes for TcIAM+TcIVAM and TcIAM+TcIIPR; there was elimination of infective forms as early as at 20 days. Our results suggest that both the genetics of the parasite and its geographic origin influence the susceptibility to infection and vector competence, alone or in association."

Moreira de Souza and F. Abad-Franch.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=18645,2022,"Triatoma costalimai is a little-known triatomine-bug species whose role as a vector of Chagas disease remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive review of the literature and assessed the evidence base from a public-health perspective. We found 89 individual documents/resources with information about T. costalimai. DNA-sequence and cytogenetic data indicate that T. costalimai belongs, together with T. jatai, in a distinct clade within the ‘pseudomaculata group’ of South American Triatoma. Triatoma costalimai is probably a narrow endemic of the Cerrado on the upper Tocantins River Basin and associated ranges/plateaus; there, the species thrives in the sandstone/limestone outcrops typical of the “Cerrado rupestre” (rocky-soil savanna) and “mata seca decídua calcária” (limestone-soil dry forest) phytophysiognomies. Wild T. costalimai appear to feed on whatever vertebrates are available in rocky outcrops, with lizards and rodents being most common. There is persuasive evidence that house invasion/infestation by T. costalimai has increased in frequency since the 1990s. The bugs often carry Trypanosoma cruzi, often defecate while feeding, have high fecundity/fertility, and, under overtly favorable conditions, can produce two generations per year. Current knowledge suggests that T. costalimai can transmit human Chagas disease in the upper Tocantins Basin; control-surveillance systems should ‘tag’ the species as a potentially important local vector in thestatesof Goiás and Tocantins, Brazil. Further research is needed to clarify (i) the drivers and dynamics of house invasion, infestation, and reinfestation by T. costalimai and (ii) the genetic structuring and vector capacity of the species, including its wild and non-wild populations."
