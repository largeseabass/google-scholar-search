In the present study, a molecular approach using cytochrome B and cytochrome oxidase I was implemented for the genetic identification and determination of the origin of that population. Phylogenetic analyses positively identified our studied specimens as belonging to the T. infestans clade based on genetic markers with high posterior probability values, and the haplotype network showed Uruguay, Chile and Argentina as probable countries of origin of the populations inmexico, which was supported by gene flow and migration index analyses. Due to the proximity of the port of Manzanillo to the collection sites, the introduced specimens were hypothesized to have travelled from the countries of origin tomexicoin a seed shipment inside a TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) maritime container. The identification of T. infestans inmexicorepresents a serious health problem, and the findings presented here indicate a novel pathway for displacing this vector with the possibility of transmission to any other part of the world, which should be further investigated."

Pregnant women and their children are of particular importance to screen as T. cruzi can be transmitted vertically. The objective of this study was to screen for T. cruzi infection among pregnant women from endemic areas seen at the Hospital General demexicofor prenatal care, so that they and their children may be quickly connected to CD treatment. Pregnant women were recruited through the hospital prenatal clinic and screened for T. cruzi infection using a series of serological and molecular tests. Of 150 screened patients, mean age 26.8 (SD 6.4), 30 (20.0%) were positive by at least one diagnostic test. Of these, only nine (6%) were positive as determined by PCR. Diagnosis of chronic CD is difficult in endemic places likemexicodue to the limitations of current commercially available diagnostic tests. Further evaluation of diagnostic performance of various assays could improve current CD diagnostic algorithms and proper care management in these regions. Genetic variability in the parasite may also play a role in the differing assay performances seen in this study, and this may be a valuable avenue of further research."
Interrupting Chagas Transmission in an Endemic Region of Guatemala: The Long-Term Impact of an Ecohealth Intervention.,"Pereira, F. M., D. Penados, P. L. Dorn, B. Alcántara and M. C. Monroy.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=15750,2022,"Triatoma dimidiata is the main vector of Chagas disease in southernmexico, Central America and northern South America. As an autochthonous vector, it moves readily among domestic, peri-domestic and sylvatic environments, making it difficult to control only using insecticide as this requires regular application, and re-infestation frequently occurs. Other social innovation alternatives such as those based on Ecohealth principles can be used to tackle the dynamics of the disease in an integral way. We asked whether an Ecohealth intervention, implemented beginning in 2001 in a highly infested village in southeastern Guatemala, was sustainable in the long term. This intervention included making low-cost house improvements to eliminate transmission risk factors such as repairing cracked walls, covering dirt floors with a cement-like substance and moving domestic animals outside. We assessed the long-term sustainability through entomological and house condition surveys, as well as an analysis of community satisfaction. We found over a 19-year period, infestation with T. dimidiata was reduced and maintained at a level where vector transmission is unlikely. This reduction coincided with a large proportion of villagers implementing the Ecohealth approach, improving their houses and managing their domestic animals to maintain the village at low risk for Chagas transmission. High levels of community satisfaction were also observed, which likely played a role in the long-term persistence of the modifications. Although the infestation has remained low, 11 years following the last intervention and as the population grew there has been an increase in the proportion of 'at-risk' houses pointing out the necessity of maintaining vigilance. The Ecohealth approach is a low-cost, sustainable approach for the long-term control of vector-borne Chagas disease. We recommend this approach including ongoing community monitoring and institutional response for the long-term, integrated control of Chagas disease."

In many areas in Latin America where T. cruzi is endemic, this cycle is poorly known, and its main reservoirs have not been identified. In this study we analyzed T. cruzi infection in bats and other small mammals from an Ecological Reserve in southeasternmexico. From January through March 2021, we captured wild individuals to extract cardiac and peripheral blood, and infection was detected by PCR of the mini-exon gene. In bats, the prevalence of infection was 16.36%, while in small mammals the prevalence was 28.57%. All of the samples that were positive for T. cruzi were identified as the TCI genotype. Our findings suggest that this zone, situated at the periphery of urban zones might have epidemiological relevance in the sylvatic cycle of T. cruzi and needs to be monitored. The infection of bats in this area is particularly concerning since the flight pattern of this populations overlaps with human settlements. Despite being subject to conservation protections, there continue to be anthropogenic actions that disturb the study area, which could exacerbate risks to public health."

Arellano.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=15760,2022,"Triatoma pallidipennis constitues one of the most important Chagas disease vector inmexico. Previous studies based on molecular data suggest T. pallidipennis as a complex of cryptic species. For that reason, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of T. pallidipennis using DNA sequences from the mitochondrial ND4 gene and the ITS- 2 gene. In addition, the divergence times were estimated, and possible new taxa were delimited with three species delimitation methods. Finally, genetic distances and possible connectivity routes based on shared haplotypes were obtained among the T. pallidipennis populations. Five haplogroups (possible cryptic species) were found, based on delimitation methods and genetic distances. Haplogroup divergence began about 3 Ma, in the Pleistocene. Moreover, none of the haplogroups showed potential connectivity routes between them, evidencing lack of gene flow. Our results suggest the existence of a new cryptic species complex within what is currently recognized as a T. pallidipennis."

His immunosuppression therapy included tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone. An endomyocar- dial biopsy revealed lymphocytic and eosinophilic inflammation, myocyte damage, and rare foci of in- tracellular organisms consistent with Trypanosoma cruzi amastigotes. The patient had no known history of Chagas disease. Upon additional questioning, the patient endorsed bites from reduviid bugs during childhood in El Salvador. Follow-up serum PCR testing was positive for T. cruzi DNA. Tests for other infec- tious organisms and donor specific antibodies were negative. This case illustrates the striking clinical and histologic similarities between acute cellular rejection and acute CDR with cardiac involvement in heart transplant patients, and thus emphasizes the importance of pre-transplant testing for Chagas in patients with epidemiologic risk factors."

Methods One hundred and 16 human blood samples and 34 dog blood samples were collected. The presence of anti-T. cruzi antibodies was determined using four different ELISA assays. Moreover, reactive ELISA sera from humans and dogs were processed by indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) to confirm the presence of anti-T. cruzi antibodies.  Results Serologic tests for T. cruzi infection showed a prevalence of 5.1% (6/116) in humans and of 50% (17/34) in owned dogs.  Conclusion The presence of animals (dogs, chickens and wild animals), as well as some characteristics of house construction were identified as risk factors for infestation and infection. Complementary studies must be carried out to allow a better understanding of the transmission dynamics in the state of Veracruz,mexico, and the implementation of adequate control programs."
A New Record of the Introduced Species Triatoma infestans (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in Mexico.,"Martínez-Hernández, F., G. Villalobos, O. D. Montañez-Valdez and J. A.

Fifty-nine specimens (71.2% adults) of the introduced species were collected from the peridomestic areas of a single house in the port of Manzanillo in the state of Colima,mexico. Thirty-one specimens (52.5%) were collected from the exterior walls of the house and were apparently attracted to light. The other specimens (47.5%) were associated with chickens. No specimen was infected with Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, the causative agent of Chagas disease, possibly because they were feeding on chickens. We speculate that the introduced species travelled from South America tomexicovia seed shipment in a twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) maritime container. Because Mexican phytosanitary regulations demand only the cargo to be inspected, the triatomines could have escaped notice during inspection. Subsequently, as the cargo was unloaded and the TEU was stored, the triatomines likely flew to and invaded the nearby residential areas. The rediscovery of this domestic vector of T. cruzi inmexicowarrants further investigation owing to the potential risk of transmission to the inhabitants of the study area."

Our study aimed to construct the ecological niche models (ENMs) of this understudied vector species and the parasite responsible for Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi). We modelled the ecological niches of both species under current and future climate change projections in 2050 using four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5. We also assessed the human population at risk of exposure to D. maxima bites, the hypothesis of ecological niche equivalency and similarity between D. maxima and T. cruzi, and finally the abundance centroid hypothesis. The ENM predicted a higher overlap between both species in the Western and Southern coastal regions of the Baja California Peninsula. The climate change scenarios predicted a Northern shift in the ecological niche of both species. Our findings suggested that the highly tourist destination of Los Cabos is a high-risk zone for Chagas disease circulation. Overall, the study provides valuable data to vector surveillance and control programs."

However, we do not have hard evidence about this phenomenon. Our objective was to estimate ChD’s seroprevalence in westernmexico, analyzing its association with socio-demographic variables. Methods: We surveyed 1264 habitants of 58 rural and urban localities in Jalisco, Colima, and Nayarit,mexico, identifying the ChD through indirect hemagglutination and Western Blot tests. We recorded socio-demographic and house characteristics, analyzing their association with ChD using Multiple Logistic Regression. Results: We found 85 ChD cases (seroprevalence of 6.7%). We found a significant correlation with low SES young females in rural areas (OR= 3.28; p= 0.002). However, no significant association of ChD with the SES, the SL, or the house’s quality was noticed. Conclusion: Young women living in rural areas with a low SES represent a risk population that deserves attention for preventive programs. We did not find an association of ChD with the rest of the variables in persons older than 31 years, suggesting that ChD transmission in this region is not a predominantly poverty or ignorance problem."
Diagnosis and Clinical Management of Chagas Disease: An Increasing Challenge in Non-Endemic Areas.,"Suárez, C., D. Nolder, A. García-Mingo, D. A. J. Moore and P. L. Chiodini.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=16694,2022,"Chagas disease (CD) is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and it is endemic in Central, South America,mexicoand the South of the United States. It is an important cause of early mortality and morbidity, and it is associated with poverty and stigma. A third of the cases evolve into chronic cardiomyopathy and gastrointestinal disease. The infection is transmitted vertically and by blood/organ donation and can reactivate with immunosuppression. Case identification requires awareness and screening programmes targeting the population at risk (women in reproductive age, donors, immunocompromised patients). Treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox is most effective in the acute phase and prevents progression to chronic phase when given to children. Treating women antenatally reduces but does not eliminate vertical transmission. Treatment is poorly tolerated, contraindicated during pregnancy, and has little effect modifying the disease in the chronic phase. Screening is easily performed with serology. Migration has brought the disease outside of the endemic countries, where the transmission continues vertically and via blood and tissue/organ donations. There are more than 32 million migrants from Latin America living in non-endemic countries. However, the infection is massively underdiagnosed in this setting due to the lack of awareness by patients, health authorities and professionals. Blood and tissue donation screening policies have significantly reduced transmission in endemic countries but are not universally established in the non-endemic setting. Antenatal screening is not commonly done. Other challenges include difficulties accessing and retaining patients in the healthcare system and lack of specific funding for the interventions. Any strategy must be accompanied by education and awareness campaigns directed to patients, professionals and policy makers. The involvement of patients and their communities is central and key for success and must be sought early and actively. This review proposes strategies to address challenges faced by non-endemic countries."
Life History Data of Dipetalogaster maxima (Hemiptera: Reduviidae).,"Meraz-Medina, T., B. Nogueda-Torres and J. A.

Its behavior and vectorial capacity have been scarcely studied, although such information is necessary to reliably estimate the importance of this species as a vector of T. cruzi in its distribution area. This study reports biological parameters related to the vectorial capacity of D. maxima. In particular, the egg-to-adult development time, number of blood meals required to molt, accumulative mortality, time to beginning of feeding, feeding and defecation times, fecundity, and fertility were examined. D. maxima took a median of 211 d to develop from egg to adult, requiring 11 meals in total. Almost two-thirds (63%) of specimens died during the cycle. The time to beginning of feeding was 1 min in all instars. Feeding times varied from 14 to 27 min. Most nymphs (except first-instar) defecated when feeding or immediately thereafter. A mean of 0.7 eggs//day was recorded, with an eclosion rate of 27.3%. Five of the eight studied parameters (mainly defecation delay) suggest the remarkable potential vectorial capacity of D. maxima, so it is necessary to maintain permanent surveillance of domiciliary populations of D. maxima, because they may be infected with T. cruzi."

Chemotherapeutic intervention is usually effective but associated with severe adverse events. The development of safer, more effective therapies is hampered by the lack of biomarker(s) (BMKs) for the early assessment of therapeutic outcomes. The mammal-dwelling trypomastigote parasite stage expresses glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored mucins (tGPI-MUC), whose O-glycans are mostly branched with terminal, nonreducing a-galactopyranosyl (a-Gal) glycotopes. These are absent in humans, and thus highly immunogenic and inducers of specific CD anti-a-Gal antibodies. In search for A-Gal-based BMKs, here we describe the synthesis of neoglycoprotein NGP11b, comprised of a carrier protein decorated with the branched trisaccharide Gala(1,2)[Gala(1,6)]GalB. By chemiluminescent immunoassay using sera plasma from chronic CD (CCD) patients from Venezuela andmexicoand healthy controls, NGP11b exhibited sensitivity and specificity similar to that of tGPI-MUC from genotype TcI, predominant in those countries. Preliminary evaluation of CCD patients subjected to chemotherapy showed a significant reduction in anti-a-Gal antibody reactivity to NGP11b. Our data indicated that NGP11b is a potential BMK for diagnosis and treatment assessment in CCD patients."

A Bayesian approach was performed for the design of phylogenies, median-joining networks, and clustering among populations of T. mexicana. Our results show that the Hidalgo population was the most distinct, with the highest genetic and haplotypic variation (Hd = 0.963,  = 0.06129, and  = 0.05469). Moderate gene flow (Nm) was determined among populations of Hidalgo and Queretaro. Populations from the three states showed differentiation (FST) values ranging from 0.22 to 0.3, suggesting an important genetic differentiation. The phylogenetic analysis showed the presence of five well-defined groups, as well as the haplotype network, where 24 haplotypes were observed forming five haplogroups with high mutational steps among them: 68 (Hgo-W2), 26 (Qto), 59 (Hgo-M), 44 (Hgo-W1), and 46 (Gto). Genetic isolation was apparently inferred in the Guanajuato population; however, the Mantel test did not show correlation between genetic (FST) and geographic (km) distances (p = 0.05). The STRU CTU RE analyses showed seven genetic clusters and it was observed that a single cluster predominates in each sampled location. However, genetic admixture was detected in four localities.

The true prevalence of Chagas disease inmexicois unknown. However, it has been estimated that 1.1–4 million people are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi , which represents a potential risk for transmission of the disease via contaminated blood. Aim of the Study. To determine the Chagas disease seroprevalence in donors from eight blood banks in the north ofmexicoCity, and the northeast of the State ofmexico. Study Design and Methods. Serum samples from blood donors ( n = 515,038) were tested to detect the presence of anti- Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies in eight blood banks. The serologic screening test was performed in each of the blood banks. To confirm the seropositive blood donors, only two out of the eight blood banks used a test with a different principle with the aim of identifying anti- Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies. All tests were validated by the Mexican Institute for Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference. Results. One thousand two hundred and ten blood donors were seropositive for Try- panosoma cruzi , which represents a 0.23% seroprevalence (95% CI 0.22–0.25%). Of the seropositive blood donors, 97.03 % resided in the northeast area of the State ofmexico,mexicoCity, and southern part of the State of Hidalgo. Conclusions. Active transmission of Chagas disease may be occurring in non-endemic regions in the northeast of the State ofmexico."

This illness is potentially life-threatening and highly disabling and represents a major public health concern in the endemic countries in Latin America. The analysis of the spatial and temporal occurrence of triatomine insects is critical, since control strategies strongly depend on the vector species found within each area. Such knowledge is non-existent in Hidalgo state, an endemic region of Chagas disease inmexico. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to analyze broad-scale spatial and temporal patterns of synanthropic triatomines collected in Hidalgo. Data was taken from the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE) ofmexicoand the state program of Vector Control of the Secretary of Health, covering the period of 1997–2019. Our analyses demonstrate a differential distribution of Triatoma dimidiata, T. mexicana, T. gerstaeckeri and T. barberi, which are the four predominant species, and that climate, temperature, and precipitation are some of the drivers of their distribution pattern. Notably, we report the presence of T. nitida, T. pallidipennis and T. phyllosoma for the first time in the state. In addition, we found seasonal variations of the populations of T. mexicana and T. gerstaeckeri, but not for T. dimidiata, whose population remains constant throughout the year. The insects were found mainly intradomicile (81.79%), followed by peridomicile (17.56%) and non-domestic areas (0.65%), with an average T. cruzi infection of 16.4%. Based on this evidence, priority sites for vector control intervention were identified. Our findings are very valuable for understanding the epidemiology of Chagas disease, the generation of future potential risk maps and for the development and implementation of effective and targeted vector control programs in Hidalgo state."
"Trends in Mortality from Ischemic Heart Disease in the Region of the Americas, 2000-2019.","Lanas, F. and A. Soto.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=17405,2022,"Background: In latest decades, mortality rates from ischemic heart disease (IHD) had declined steadily in most of the world as a consequence of improvements in prevention and therapy. Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze trends in mortality caused by IHD in the region of the Americas from 2000 to 2019. Methods: Estimates of the age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) due to IHD were extracted from the Data Portal on Noncommunicable Diseases, Mental Health, and External Causes (ENLACE), Pan American Health Organization. We used Joinpoint regression to analyze significant changes in mortality trends by country, gender, geographical sub-region, and country income, according to the World Bank classification. We also calculated the average annual percent change (AAPC) mortality rate for the overall period in the Americas as a whole and by country and sub-region. Results: In the region of the Americas, the AAMR from IHD decreased from 117.80 (95% uncertainty interval (UI)) 106.64–135.90) in 2000 to 73.64 (62.65–92.66) per 100,000 in 2019. In males, from 149.08 (95% UI 138.23–168.08) to 96.02 (95% UI 83.48–117.19) and in females 92.36 (95% UI 81.35–109.42) to 54.84 (95% UI 45.28– 71.76). The AAPC mortality rate in the region decreased –2.5% (95% CI: –2.7, –2.3), with joinpoints in 2007 and 2012, –2.3% (95% CI: –2.5, –2.1) in men and –2.7% (95% CI: –3.0, –2.5) in women. According to the sub-region analysis, the highest decrease was recorded in North America, AAPC –3.1% (95% CI: –3.3, –3.0) with one joinpoint in 2011, whereas there was a stagnation of the mortality rate in Central America,mexico, and Latin Caribbean with an AAPC of 0.1 (–0.2, 0.3) with one joinpoint in 2007. Conclusions: Age-adjusted mortality rate from IHD between 2000 and 2019 has decreased in the region of the Americas. However, different trends were observed, North America had the highest reduction in AAPC, while Central America,mexico, and Latin Caribbean Region had a stagnation. This trend was highly influenced by country income."

The present study designed to detect the presence of Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. in rodents living in the peri-urban area of Queretaro in centralmexico. This research was carried out during two seasons of collection of wild and domestic rodents, in three localities within the peri-urban area of the state of Queretaro. These collections were carried out during the dry season of February–May 2017 and in the rainy season of August–November 2017. Samples were obtained from the tail tip, from which DNA was purified using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit. End-point PCR was used for the identification of Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. A total of 82 rodents were caught, represented in three families, six genera and seven species, of which 29 (35.3%) were positive for Trypanosoma cruzi; 13 (15.8%) for Leishmania spp.; and 12 individuals presented coinfection with both parasites (14.6%). This study confirmed the presence of Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. in synanthropic rodents in the peri-urban area of Queretaro, where Chagas and Leishmaniosis diseases are not considered endemic. It is necessary to continue researching for the presence of vectors, as well as for the detection of diseases caused by parasites in humans and thus be able to confirm the transmission cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. in this central Mexican city."

Some of the most important biological parameters to estimate the vectorial capacity of a triatomine, such as the hatching of eggs, life cycle, feeding and defecation behaviors for each instar of a population of T. infestans introduced intomexicoare reported. The egg-to-adult development times of the three studied cohorts had a mean of 215.7 days. The mean total number of blood meals required to molt from first-instar nymphs to adults was 11.7. The cumulative mortality was 30.8%. The highest mortality rate was recorded for third-instar nymphs (10.3%), whereas the lowest rate (0.8%) was recorded for first-instar nymphs. All studied specimens began feeding as soon as a blood meal source was offered, showing aggressive behavior. Feeding times were 10 min for all instars, increasing according to instar, in a similar pattern to the development times and the required blood meals before molting. Most (57.7 -82.5%) of the studied specimens of the first- to third-instar nymphs and adults of T. infestans defecated when feeding (WF). The average number of eggs laid per female per day was 0.9, with an eclosion rate of 96.4%. The results of most of the studied parameters confirm the importance of T. infestans wherever it is found because of its potential high capacity for transmitting T. cruzi to hosts. Active entomological surveillance should be carried out in the area of the first discovery of the introduced T. infestans and its surroundings to avoid the dissemination of this effective vector species inmexico."
Reactions to bites from kissing bugs (primarily genus Triatoma).,"Goddard, J. and R. D. deShazo.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=17762,2022,"Triatoma insects (colloquial names include kissing bug, Mexican bed bug, and cone-nosed bug) are found primarily in the western and southern United States, Central and South America, andmexico(picture 1 and picture 2). Kissing bug bites are usually painless and undetected by the victim. However, these insects are of medical importance both because they can transmit the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease, and also because people can develop life-threatening allergic reactions to their bites. Local reactions to Triatoma bites, most commonly consisting of erythema and edema around the puncture sites (picture 3), develop in some patients and are managed symptomatically. (See 'Local reactions' above.) Allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to Triatoma bites typically occur in the middle of the night, as Triatoma are nocturnal and bite while the victim sleeps. With the exception of this one distinguishing feature, the signs and symptoms of Triatoma anaphylaxis may be identical to those resulting from other triggers. Fatal and near-fatal cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. Acute treatment of anaphylaxis following a Triatoma bite is identical to acute treatment of anaphylaxis of any etiology.Upon discharge, all patients with anaphylaxis should be equipped with an epinephrine autoinjector and an anaphylaxis emergency action plan to manage initial treatment of recurrent episodes. Epinephrine should be kept at the bedside in the future. Once a patient with anaphylaxis has been stabilized, the home (or relevant site) should be thoroughly searched for the blood-engorged insect as soon as possible.If necessary, pest management professionals may be called upon to aid in the inspection process.Identification of the insect is important for diagnosis because reagents for skin testing and laboratory diagnosis are not available.Proper insect identification can be obtained from a local college or university entomology department or the extension service at participating land-grant universities nationwide. Patients should be given information about how to prevent future contact with Triatoma, including modifications of their homes, bedrooms, and surrounding environment.If kissing bugs are suspected to be present or found in the home, a pest management professional should be contacted. Specific immunotherapy to reduce an allergic patient's sensitivity to Triatoma is not commercially available.Thus, avoidance and education about early recognition and treatment of recurrent allergic reactions is critical."

METHODS We used samples from various organs (heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, spleen, liver, esophagus, and stomach) corresponding to individuals of gray fox and spotted skunk, captured in the peridomicile of eight rural localities of Yucatan between the period 1990–2008. The presence of T. cruzi DNA in tissue samples was determined by PCR technique and histopathology study. RESULTS All the individuals studied had at least one tissue sample with T. cruzi DNA. The esophagus (9/13), heart (7/13), and skeletal muscle (6/13) were the organs with the highest frequency of T. cruzi DNA. No nests of amastigotes were found, however, microscopic observation revealed lesions characteristic of T. cruzi infection, such as inflammatory infiltrate by lymphocytes and histiocytes with or without necrosis of cardiomyocytes cells, and proliferation of fibrocytes, fibroblasts and collagen fibers (fibrosis). CONCLUSIONS Our results confirm that these two wild carnivores are natural hosts for T. cruzi in Yucatan,mexico. The synanthropic behavior of these two mammals in Yucatan makes it necessary to focus future studies on their role within the rural peridomiciliary transmission cycle of T. cruzi in the Yucatan Peninsula.

A significant difference was found in the period of egg-to-adult development between the five mammalian feeds (mean 195 days) and the chicken feed (221 days). The probability of survival was significantly lower in the chicken cohort (0.285). The total number of blood meals to moult from the first instar to the adult stage was the highest in the chicken cohort (10–15). This cohort had the significantly highest rate of females at the end cycle. The mean number of eggs laid per female and the egg eclosion rate were similar among the six food sources. Most results seemed to be influenced by the higher nutritional quality of the mammalian blood compared to the bird’s blood and the increased energy expenditure required for the digestion of bird blood. These results clearly show that T. pallidipennis, unlike other triatomine species, has a high reproductive capacity when feeding on different hosts."

Up to 8 million individuals inmexico, Central America, and South America are estimated to be infected with Chagas disease, the majority of whom are unaware of their condition. Infection is a chronic and potentially fatal condition if left untreated. Drugs that are currently on the market were empirically developed more than three decades ago. Purpose As a result, they frequently have severe side effects and low efficacy, especially in the common chronic form of the condition. Hence, this has resulted in searching for alternative therapeutic options to control this disease, and natural products could be explored to this effect. Method We employed molecular dynamics simulation and binding energy analyses to decipher and unravel the mechanistic inhibitory potential of five selected natural compounds as potential inhibitors of T. cruzi glucokinase for treating Chagas disease as an alternative therapy. Results The results revealed that CPD3 (ZINC 000002345225) displayed the highest binding activity, with a total binding energy of -35.16 kcal/mol, compared to other compounds. The PRED approach identified crucial moieties of CPD3 and several molecular interactions prominent in its binding activity, such as Hydrogen Bond, Alkyl, and Pi-Alkyl. ASN 308, GLY 306, LEU 187, THR 185, GLY 184, and ALA 182 played significant roles in the effective binding activity of CPD3, as evidenced in their steady complementary multiple interactions exhibited throughout the simulation period. In this study, we recommend CPD3 as a promising lead compound that can further promote more experimental investigations for the design of drugs for Chagas disease, thereby addressing the limitations of current therapy options. Conclusion These results showed that natural compounds could be potential candidates against the inhibition of T. cruzi glucokinase for treating Chagas disease as an alternative therapy."

Cruzamentos experimentais entre espécies agrupadas em gêneros diferentes, em geral, não resultam em híbridos, ou seja, existem barreiras reprodutivas pré-zigóticas instaladas. Assim, o presente estudo teve como objetivo realizar cruzamentos experimentais entre M. longipennis e T. mopan, com o intuito de avaliar o status genérico de Meccus. Além disso, revisitamos questões genéticas, taxonômicas e evolutivas relacionadas com o status específico das seis espécies que compõem o gênero Meccus. Híbridos foram obtidos para o cruzamento entre  T. mopan x T. longipennis, demonstrando que não existe barreira reprodutiva pré-zigótica instalada entre Meccus e Triatoma. Além disso, informações genéticas, taxonômicas e evolutivas revisitadas confirmaram o status específico das espécies inicialmente agrupadas no gênero Meccus. Nossos resultados demonstram que Meccus não é um gênero válido (o que resultou na sua sinonimização com Triatoma) e ressaltam que T. bassolsae, T. longipennis, T. mazzottii, T. pallidipennis, T. phyllosoma e T. picturata são espécies válidas."
"Disentangling the contributions of biotic and abiotic predictors in the niche and the species distribution model of Trypanosoma cruzi, etiological agent of Chagas disease.","Rengifo-Correa, L., C. González-Salazar and C. R. Stephens.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=18929,2023,"The potential benefits of incorporating biotic, as well as abiotic, predictors in niche and species distribution models (SDMs), as well as how to achieve this, is still debated, with their interpretability and explanatory potential being particularly questioned. It is therefore important to stress test modelling methodologies that include biotic factors against use cases where there is ample knowledge of the potential biotic component of the niche. Relatively well studied and important vector-borne diseases offer just such an opportunity, where knowledge of the agents involved in the transmission cycle –vectors and hosts– can serve to calibrate and test the niche model and corresponding SDM. Here, we study the contributions of biotic –14 vectors, 459 potential hosts– and abiotic –258 climatic categories– predictors to the explanatory and predictive features of the niche and corresponding SDM for the etiological agent of Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, inmexico. Using an established spatial data mining technique, we generate biotic, abiotic and biotic+abiotic niche and SDM models. We test our models by comparing predictions of the most important probable hosts of Chagas disease with a previously published list of confirmed hosts. We quantify, compare, and contrast the individual and total contributions of predictors to the niche and distribution of Chagas disease inmexico. We assess the relative predictive potential of these variables to model performance, showing that models that include relevant biotic niche variables lead to more predictive, more ecologically realistic SDMs. Our research illustrates a useful general procedure for identifying and ranking potential biotic interactions and for assessing the relative importance of biotic and abiotic predictors. We conclude that the inclusion of both abiotic and biotic predictors in SDMs not only provides more predictive and accurate models but also models that are more understandable and explainable from an ecological niche perspective."

Here we compare T. pallidipennis haplogroups using head and pronotum features, environmental characteristics of their habitats, and ecological niche modeling. To analyze variation in shape, images of the head and pronotum of the specimens were obtained and analyzed using methods based on landmarks and semi-landmarks. Ecological niche models were obtained from occurrence data, as well as a set of bioclimatic variables that characterized the environmental niche of each analyzed haplogroup. Deformation grids for head showed a slight displacement towards posterior region of pre-ocular landmarks. Greatest change in head shape was observed with strong displacement towards anterior region of antenniferous tubercle. Procrustes ANOVA and pairwise comparisons showed differences in mean head shape in almost all haplogroups. However, pairwise comparisons of mean pronotum shape only showed differences among three haplogroups. Correct classification of all haplogroups was not possible using discriminant analysis. Important differences were found among the environmental niches of the analyzed haplogroups. Ecological niche models of each haplogroup did not predict the climatic suitability areas of the other haplogroups, revealing differences in environmental conditions. Significant differences were found between at least two haplogroups, demonstrating distinct environmental preferences among them. Our results show how the analysis of morphometric variation and the characterization of the environmental conditions that define the climatic niche can be used to improve the delimitation of T. pallidipennis haplogroups that constitute cryptic species."

We characterized the genetic diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi circulating in five triatomine species (Triatoma gerstaeckeri, T. lecticularia, T.indictiva, T. sanguisuga and T. recurva) collected in Texas and Southern Arizona using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) with four single-copy loci (cytochrome oxidase subunit II- NADH dehydrogensase subunit 1 region (COII-ND1), mismatch-repair class 2 (MSH2), dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) and a nuclear gene with ID TcCLB.506529.310). All T. cruzi variants fall in two main genetic lineages: 75% of the samples corresponded to T. cruzi Discrete Typing Unit (DTU) I (TcI), and 25% to a North American specific lineage previously labelled TcIV-USA. Phylogenetic and sequence divergence analyses of our new data plus all previously published sequence data from those four loci collected in the USA, show that TcIV-USA is significantly different from any other previously defined T. cruzi DTUs. The significant level of genetic divergence between TcIV-USA and other T. cruzi DTUs should lead to an increased focus on understanding the epidemiological importance of this DTU, as well as its geographical range and pathogenicity in humans and domestic animals. Our findings further corroborate the fact that there is a high genetic diversity of the parasite in North America and emphasize the need for appropriate surveillance and vector control programs for Chagas disease in southern USA andmexico."

Chagas as a potential aetiology of dilated cardiomyopathy remains under-recognized. We present a case where multimodality imaging was essential in the diagnosis and management of Chagas heart disease. Case summary A 54-year-old man, originally frommexico, presented to the emergency department with chest pain and recurrent syncopal episodes, found to be in haemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring urgent cardioversion. Urgent coronary angiography revealed no obstructive disease. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed moderately reduced left ventricular systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction 35–40%) with apical akinesis and an aneurysm of the apical septum. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) confirmed a prominent apical aneurysm with dyskinesis of the apical septum, with the evidence of transmural myocardial late gadolinium enhancement of the entire left ventricular apex and a small apical thrombus. Serologic testing was positive for Trypanosoma cruzi IgG antibody, which was confirmed on repeat testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Patient underwent VT ablation and was discharged on guideline-directed medical therapy including a regimen of anticoagulation, beta-blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapies. He has had no subsequent syncope or VT. Discussion Chagas heart disease remains under-recognized and under-diagnosed despite the growing burden of T. cruzi infection in the USA. Suspicion for Chagas heart disease should be considered in patients presenting with heart failure symptoms and ventricular arrhythmias with the right corresponding history and imaging findings on echocardiogram and CMR."

The presence of the vector in urban areas in most cases is due to the passive transport of vectors, but recently, its presence seems to be linked to vector adaptation processes associated with climate change. This paper reports the occurrence of an infected triatomine in the peridomicile of a house in an urban area of Córdoba, Veracruz,mexico, where the species found is described, the molecular characteristics and resistance to BZN and NFX of the Trypanosoma cruzi isolate obtained, as well as serological data of the dwelling inhabitants.

Identification of inhibitors as drug candidates against Chagas disease.,"Cruz Araujo, S., R. Molina de Angelo, H. Barbosa, T. Alves Costa-Silva, A. G. Tempone, J. H. Ghilardi Lago and K. M. Honorio.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=19189,2023,"Chagas disease, after more than a century after its discovery, is still a major public health problem. It is estimated that approximately 10 million people worldwide are infected with T. cruzi. However, the situation is more critical in Latin America and other regions where the disease is endemic. The largest number of cases occurs in Brazil, Argentina, andmexicoas more than 100 million people in these regions are located in areas with a high risk of contamination by the vector. The need for new therapeutic alternatives is urgent, as the available drugs have severe limitations such as low efficacy and high toxicity. From this scenario, in this work, we employed the virtual screening technique using cruzain and BDF2 as key biological targets for the survival of the parasite. Our objective was to identify potential inhibitors of T. cruzi trypomastigotes, which could be considered drug candidates against Chagas disease. For this, we employed different in silico methodologies and the obtained results were corroborated using in vitro biological assays. For the VS studies, a database containing synthetic compounds was simulated at the binding site of cruzain and BDF2. In addition, pharmacophoric models were constructed in the initial phases of VS, as well as other advanced analyses (molecular dynamics simulations, calculations of binding free energy, and ADME prediction) were carried out and the results allowed the selection of potential inhibitors of T. cruzi. Based on the obtained data, 32 different compounds commercially available were subjected to biological tests against the trypomastigote form of T. cruzi. As result, 11 of those compounds displayed significant activity against T. cruzi and can be considered potential candidates for the treatment of Chagas disease."

Methods: A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted between March 2014 and October 2019 among Latin American migrants in six cities in Germany to obtain information on migration history, socioeconomic and insurance status, knowledge about CD, potential risk factors for Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and willingness to donate blood or organs. Results: 168 participants completed the questionnaire. The four countries with the highest proportion of participants contributing to the study population were Colombia,mexico, Peru and Ecuador. Before migrating to Europe, the majority of the study population resided in an urban setting in houses made of stone or concrete, had higher academic education and was integrated into the German healthcare and healthcare insurance system. The majority of all study participants were also willing to donate blood and organs and a quarter of them had donated blood previously. However, many participants lacked basic knowledge about symptoms and modes of transmission of Chagas disease. One out of 56 serologic tests (1.8%) performed was positive. The seropositive female participant born in Argentina had a negative PCR test and no signs of cardiac or other organ involvement. Conclusions: The study population does not reflect the population structure at risk for T. cruzi infection in endemic countries. Most participants had a low risk profile for infection with T. cruzi. Although the sample size was small and sampling was not representative of all persons at risk in Germany, the seroprevalence found was similar to studies previously conducted in Europe. As no systematic screening for T. cruzi in Latin American blood and organ donors as well as in women of child-bearing age of Latin American origin is implemented in Germany, a risk of occasional transmission of T. cruzi remains."

It is estimated that around 6 million people are currently infected with the parasite in Latin America, and 25 million live in endemic areas with active transmission. The disease causes an estimated economic loss of USD 24 billion dollars annually, with a loss of 75,200 working years per year of life; it is responsible for around ~12,000 deaths annually. Althoughmexicois an endemic country that recorded 10,186 new cases of Chagas disease during the period of 1990–2017, few studies have evaluated the genetic diversity of genes that could be involved in the prophylaxis and/or diagnosis of the parasite. One of the possible candidates proposed as a vaccine target is the 24 kDa trypomastigote excretory–secretory protein, Tc24, whose protection is linked to the stimulation of T. cruzi-specific CD8+ immune responses. (2) Methods: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the fine-scale genetic diversity and structure of Tc24 in T. cruzi isolates frommexico, and to compare them with other populations reported in the Americas with the aim to reconsider the potential role of Tc24 as a key candidate for the prophylaxis and improvement of the diagnosis of Chagas disease inmexico. (3) Results: Of the 25 Mexican isolates analysed, 48% (12) were recovered from humans and 24% (6) recovered from Triatoma barberi and Triatoma dimidiata. Phylogenetic inferences revealed a polytomy in the T. cruzi clade with two defined subgroups, one formed by all sequences of the DTU I and the other formed by DTU II–VI; both subgroups had high branch support. Genetic population analysis detected a single (monomorphic) haplotype of TcI throughout the entire distribution across bothmexicoand South America. This information was supported by Nei’s pairwise distances, where the sequences of TcI showed no genetic differences. (4) Conclusions: Given that both previous studies and the findings of the present work confirmed that TcI is the only genotype detected from human isolates obtained from various states ofmexico, and that there is no significant genetic variability in any of them, it is possible to propose the development of in silico strategies for the production of antigens that optimise the diagnosis of Chagas disease, such as quantitative ELISA methods that use this region of Tc24."

Es endémica en 21 países de América Central y Sudamérica (según datos de la OMS), en el área comprendida entre México y Argentina (exceptuando las islas del Caribe); aunque debido a los movimientos migratorios que se han producido en las últimas décadas en todo el mundo, la enfermedad actualmente puede ser diagnosticada en cualquier país, principalmente de Norteamérica y Europa. Se estima que unos 6-7 millones de personas están infectadas de forma global en el mundo, y se diagnostican aproximadamente 30 mil casos nuevos anuales (OMS), por todas las formas de transmisión. Se producen un promedio de 12.000 muertes al año y aproximadamente unos 8.600 recién nacidos (RN) nacen al año con la enfermedad, tras haberse infectado durante la gestación. Dentro de Europa, España es el país con mayor número de personas con EC, siendo aquellas originarias de Bolivia las que representan la mayoría de los casos, alcanzando el 81% del total. Se puede transmitir por: a) vía vectorial: tras la picadura de un insecto de la familia de los triatominos (conocido como chinche “del beso”, vinchuca, chipo o chiribico según las localizaciones geográficas), produciéndose el paso a la sangre del parásito por el rascado de la piel b) transfusión o trasplante de órganos; c) vía vertical, desde la mujer embarazada a su hijo (vía de transmisión principal en nuestro medio y el resto de áreas no endémicas); y d) vía oral (alimentos contaminados con las heces de los insectos vectores) y accidente de laboratorio; siendo estas dos vías poco frecuentes. La mujer gestante infectada puede estar asintomática y por tanto desconocer el riesgo de transmisión vertical. Ésta oscila en torno al 2% en áreas no endémicas y alcanza el 4-6% en algunas zonas endémicas1. La enfermedad podría pasar desapercibida durante los primeros años de vida del niño y diagnosticarse ya en fase crónica. Por ello es necesaria la realización del cribado en las embarazadas procedentes de áreas endémicas y el seguimiento posnatal en caso de positividad2. Es vital descartar la infección congénita en hijos de madre con EC, ya que el tratamiento del niño en estos casos conduce a casi el 100% de curaciones (evitando complicaciones futuras) y presenta menor tasa de reacciones adversas que en edades más tardías."

Prevalence was calculated using (i) positive cases detected in a serological test (ELISA and Western blot), (ii) positive cases detected in a qPCR test, and (iii) positive cases detected by both techniques. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were determined individually for serology, qPCR and for both techniques used simultaneously. The prevalence observed varied: for serology, 25.8% of the dogs and 7.9% of the owners were seropositive, while for qPCR 29.2% of the dogs and 10.1% of the owners were identified as positive. Combination of serological and molecular techniques resulted in a prevalence of 38.2% for dogs and 12.4% for their owners. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive values calculated for both techniques improved when both techniques were used simultaneously (sensitivity of 92.4% and specificity of 100% for infected dogs and sensitivity of 93.4% and specificity of 100% for infected owners). Combined use of serological tests and qPCR allowed identifying a greater number of positive cases in dogs and their owners. This strategy may help implement adequate and timely epidemiological surveillance of American trypanosomiasis in order to prevent the appearance of new cases of Trypanosoma cruzi infections in endemic zones."

The main transmission mechanism for the parasite in endemic areas is contact with the feces of an infected triatomine bug. Part of the life cycle of T. cruzi occurs in the digestive tract of triatomines, where vector and parasite engage in a close interaction at a proteomic–molecular level. This interaction triggers replication and differentiation processes in the parasite that can affect its infectivity for the vertebrate host. With the aim of compiling and analyzing information from indexed publications on transcripts, proteins, and glycoproteins in the guts of fasting, fed, and T. cruzi-infected triatomines in the period 2000–2022, a systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Fifty-five original research articles retrieved from PubMed and ScienceDirect were selected; forty-four papers reported 1–26,946 transcripts, and twenty-one studies described 1–2603 peptides/proteins."

Materials and Methods: A triatomine was collected in a peridomestic environment of a rural dwelling in the state of Chiapas. The triatomine was identified morphologically as an adult female Eratyrus cuspidatus Stal. Results: Microscopic analysis revealed flagellate forms of T. cruzi in the feces of the E. cuspidatus collected. This was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Amplification of the mini-exon gene showed that the T. cruzi infecting E. cuspidatus corresponded to lineage I. Conclusions: This is the first report frommexicoof E. cuspidatus found infected in a human dwelling, which represents an important adaptation process to inhabit human environments."

This study describes the infection by T. fariai in field-collected eggs of T. dimidiata (Hemiptera: Reduviidae). The eggs were obtained in the peridomicile of a house in Tuetal Sur (Alajuela Province, Costa Rica). The wasp progeny, observed 24 h after receiving the eggs, consisted mainly of females (94.0%). The species confirmation was carried out by analysis of the male genitalia and DNA sequences corresponding to a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 mitochondrial gene (COI). The identity of the wasp, based on analysis of sequences, places the local strain in proximity to specimens collected in Veracruz,mexico. The characterization of strains of T. fariai could be useful for the identification of the best candidates to be employed in the biological control of T. dimidiata."
Merging socioecological variables to predict risk of Chagas disease.,"Rocha-Ortega, M., A. Nava-Bolanos and A. Cordoba-Aguilar.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=19980,2024,"How far are we from predicting the occurrence of zoonotic diseases? In this paper we have made use of both socioecological and ecological variables to predict Chagas disease occurrence. Chagas disease involves, Trypanosoma cruzi, a complex life-cycle parasite which requires two hosts: blood-feeding triatomine insects and vertebrate hosts including humans. We have used a common risk assessment method combined with datasets that imply critical environmental and socioeconomic drivers of Chagas dynamics to predict the occurrence of this disease. We also carried out a network analysis to assess the interactions among triatomines and mammal host species given their human contact via whether hunted, domesticated or associated with anthropogenic landscapes inmexico. We found that social backwardness variation, lack of health services and altitude had the largest relative influence Chagas events. Triatoma pallidipennis made use of the largest host diversity. Host species shared by the highest number of different triatomines were a woodrat, the highly appreciated bushmeat, and racoon. These results indicate both the predominance of socio-economic factors over ecological ones, and how close we are from predicting zoonotic diseases. 1. Introduction Globalization and land use conversion have given place to an unprecedented mixing of wild species, humans and domesticated animals that are unusual in the sense that they had previously occurred as unconnected biological communities (Stephens et al., 2021). In such circumstances, zoonotic pandemics and emerging infectious diseases have become new challenges from varying interfaces and interactions between humans and non-human organisms (Friedman et al., 2022). Zoonotic diseases are multifactorial, whereby pathogen prevalence, intermediate host and vector diversity and populations, landscape structure, socioeconomic, political, scientific advances, environmental and climate status are the principal factors that explain geographical and social prevalence (Cascio et al., 2011; Gibb et al., 2020; Lawler et al., 2021). The relative importance of each of these variables needs to be carefully assessed. Thus, in this paper we have examined the link between socioeconomic factors and host diversity on the risk of acquiring Chagas disease. Socioeconomic factors influence how human diseases emerge and persist since they affect how individuals live, their quality of life, and their environmental"

Here, we studied the role of host competence, geographic area provenance, and diversity of vector-host interactions as drivers of wild mammal infection risk to Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease. We performed a systematic sampling of wild mammals in 11 states ofmexico, from 2017 to 2018. We tested the positivity of T. cruzi with the Tc24 marker in tissues samples for 61 wild mammal species (524 specimens sampled). 26 mammal species were positive for T. cruzi, of which 11 are new hosts recorded inmexico75 specimens were positive and 449 were negative for T. cruzi infection, yielding an overall prevalence of 14.3%. The standardized infection risk of T. cruzi of our examined specimens was similar, no matter the host species or their geographic origins. Additionally, we used published data of mammal positives for T. cruzi to complement records of T. cruzi infection in wild mammals and inferred a trophic network of Triatoma spp. (vectors) and wild mammal species inmexico, using spatial data-mining modelling. Infection with T. cruzi was not homogeneously distributed in the inferred trophic network. This information allowed us to develop a predictive model for T. cruzi infection risk for wild mammals inmexico, considering risk as a function of the diversity of vector-host spatial associations in a large-scale geographic context, finding that the addition of competent vectors to a multi-host parasite system amplifies host infection risk. The diversity of vector-host interactions per se constitutes a relevant driver of infection risk because hosts and vectors are not isolated from each other."

Waleckx.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20034,2023,"In the Yucatan Peninsula,mexico, Triatoma dimidiata is the main vector of Chagas disease. This is a native species in the region that principally inhabits sylvatic habitats. Nevertheless, it shows a tolerant behavior to anthropogenic disturbance, with adult bugs frequently infesting human dwellings, principally during the warm and dry season. Yet, whether the temporal variation of abundance is independent of the habitat and how this is related to the infection rate with Trypanosoma cruzi in Yucatan is still poorly understood. The objective of this study was to simultaneously analyze the temporal variations of T. dimidiata abundance and infection with T. cruzi in domestic and sylvatic habitats from two localities of rural Yucatan (Sudzal, 20 52 19 N, 88 59 20 W and Teya, 21 02 55 N, 89 04 25 W) to help for the further improvement of locally adapted strategies aimed at controlling T. cruzi vector transmission. Using community participation and a combination of different trapping techniques, we collected T. dimidiata bugs during 29 consecutive months within domestic and sylvatic habitats. We then assessed by PCR the infection of the bugs with T. cruzi. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the effect of climatic variables on the abundance of T. dimidiata and the effect of bug sex, season and habitat on the prevalence of infection with T. cruzi. Overall, 3640 specimens of T. dimidiata were collected. We clearly observed peaks of maximum abundance in both habitats during the warm and dry season and found a negative association of bug abundance with relative humidity. The overall prevalence of infection of the bugs with T. cruzi was 15.2 %. Additionally, bugs collected in domestic habitats displayed a significantly higher prevalence of infection than sylvatic bugs (19.6% vs. 6.1 %, respectively), suggesting an increased risk of T. cruzi transmission related with anthropogenic disturbance. Our study is the first to describe the annual pattern of abundance of T. dimidiata in sylvatic habitats of rural Yucatan and constitutes a contribution to the knowledge of T. dimidiata ecology and of T. cruzi transmission cycle dynamics in the region. In Yucatan, where the use of mosquito nets has shown to be effective to limit human dwelling infestation by T. dimidiata, reinforcing the awareness of local residents about the increased risk of T. cruzi transmission during the warm and dry season when realizing activities in the sylvatic ambient should be, among others, also considered to improve control strategies and limit the risk of vector transmission."

American Trypanosomiasis is endemic in much ofmexico, Central and South America 1,11. it is estimated that 6 million individuals are infected throughout Latin America, while 300,000 are infected in the U.S.1, 10, 11,16 Chagas disease has two clearly differentiated phases. Initially, the acute phase lasts about two months after infection, they may have a skin lesion or a purplish swelling of an eyelid, they may have fever, headache, enlarged lymph nodes, pallor, muscle aches, shortness of breath, swelling, and abdominal or chest pain. During the chronic phase, the infection can cause sudden death due to cardiac arrhythmias or progressive heart failure due to destruction of the cardiac muscle and its innervations. 15 Appropriate diagnostics for acute infection, nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) from blood is recommended; For chronic infection, serological testing is employed. Antitrypanosomal agents, benznidazole and nifurtimox, have shown efficacy in treating T. cruzi infection, The most serious complication is chronic chagasic heart disease, since it is the main cause of death in sick patients."

Chagas disease is recognized by the World Health Organization as one of the most neglected tropical diseases with 6–8 million cases and 50,000 resulting deaths per year (Rassi et al. 2010; WHO 2022). Humans and animals usually become infected with T. cruzi after being bitten by triatomine bugs, T. cruzi insect vectors that are often referred to as kissing or conenose bugs (Figure 1). Triatomine bugs infected with T. cruzi are only found in the Americas. Chagas disease cases caused by triatomine bug transmission generally occur inmexico, Central America, and South America. However, this disease is becoming more recognized in non-endemic areas, such as the United States, due to the migration of asymptomatic infected people to these areas (CDC 2022a). Currently, approximately 300,000 people are infected with Chagas disease in the United States, with 18,000 of these individuals in Florida (Bern and Montgomery 2009; Levesque 2021; Irish et al. 2022). Additionally, approximately 75 suspected or confirmed human Chagas disease cases resulting from local transmission via triatomines were documented in the United States from 2000 to 2018 (Lynn et al. 2020). However, more research is needed to understand the true risk of transmission in areas of the United States where triatomines are present. Awareness of Chagas disease and its vectors, transmission routes, symptoms, diagnoses, and treatments is critical in endemic and non-endemic areas of the world to ensure that Chagas disease cases are detected and treated early (Ramsey and Schofield 2003; Forsyth et al. 2022).

En áreas endémicas como México, América Central o América del Sur, la mayoría de las infecciones son transmitidas por el vector Triatoma infestans. Sin embargo, la infección también puede ser adquirida de forma congénita, a través de transfusiones de sangre, trasplante de órganos, contaminación de líquidos o alimentos, o accidentes laborales[82-84]. El plan de lucha contra el vector y las mejoras en los controles de los hemoderivados impulsado por las diferentes iniciativas de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) posibilitó disminuir la incidencia de nuevos casos vectoriales en áreas rurales y o aquellos producidos por transfusiones [85,86[. Por otro lado, las migraciones crecientes desde zonas rurales hacia áreas urbanas comunes en América Latina cambiaron el patrón epidemiológico tradicional y diseminándose también a países de Europa y Asia[87,88]. Actualmente, en regiones de Latinoamérica como Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay y Uruguay, donde existe un control parcial del vector, otras vías de transmisión como la transplacentaria cobran importancia epidemiológica (Figura 9)[89].  Se estima que en la Región de las Américas existen cerca de dos millones de mujeres en edad reproductiva infectadas por T. cruzi, de las cuales 3 a 10% transmitirán la infección al feto por vía transplacentaria, con un promedio anual de 8.000 nacimientos de infantes con enfermedad de Chagas adquirida en forma vertical89. En el último informe de la OPS del año 2022 los países que reportaron seroprevalencia para la enfermedad de Chagas en recién nacidos (RNs) expuestos en el año 2020 fueron: Bolivia (n: 76), Argentina (n: 37), Chile (n: 20) y Paraguay (n: 3) [89]. La transmisión transplacentaria representa alrededor de 40% del total de los casos de enfermedad de Chagas, y se calcula una transmisión de enfermedad congénita de entre 2 y 8% [90]. Existe seguramente, un subregistro de casos ya que la prevalencia en mujeres gestantes de otras regiones endémicas es mayor; tal es el caso de Bolivia, que con 9 a 15% de afectación en embarazo, debería arrojar mayor número de casos transplacentarios [89]. En Argentina, la prevalencia de infección en la mujer embarazada oscila entre 1 y 13%. Entre los países de América Latina y el Caribe con mayores tasas de incidencia por 1.000 nacidos vivos estimada para el año 2010 destacan Paraguay (3,4), Belice (3,3), Ecuador (3,2), Bolivia (2,3), Argentina (2,1), El Salvador (1,9), Honduras (1,3), Nicaragua (1,2), Colombia (1,1) y Venezuela (1,1) (Figura 10) [91]. Desde el año 2010, la OPS ha incorporado a la iniciativa ETMI plus a la enfermedad de Chagas con el objetivo de eliminar la vía de transmisión transplacentaria, dado que constituye un gran problema de salud pública [2]. Es necesario implementar el tamizaje en mujeres embarazadas como parte de la atención prenatal universal, junto con la vigilancia, el diagnóstico y el tratamiento de todos los RNs cuyas madres están infectadas [92,93]. Se ha comprobado que el tratamiento es efectivo y puede lograr una curación completa si se establece en los primeros meses de vida (Tabla 6) [94,95]. La recomendación actual sugiere dar tratamiento con benznidazol y nifurtimox a las mujeres en edad fértil y a las madres con seropositividad para T. cruzi después del embarazo dado que el mismo evita la transmisión transplacentaria y evita la aparición  de nuevos casos."

Triatoma sinaloensis exhibited the shortest development time (155 days), with a median of 12 blood meals. Mortality rates varied from 35% to 45% in the 3 studied cohorts. All 3 cohorts were aggressive, initiating feeding within 0.5-1 min, and had similar feeding periods ranging from 10 to 18 min. A majority (75.3-97.9%) of the hybrids defecated when feeding, immediately after feeding, or in less than 1 min post-feeding. In contrast, only 7-42% of nymphs of T. sinaloensis defecated during the same period. Our results regarding the 6 parameters studied confirm the potential role of T. p. nahuatlae as an efficient vector of T. cruzi. Triatoma sinaloensis, on the other hand, exhibited limited vectorial capacity primarily due to its poor defecation behavior.

Vidal-Martínez.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20633,2024,"Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi mainly transmitted through the feces of Triatominae bugs, is a significant zoonosis in Latin America and is increasingly becoming a concern in the USA. Since the 1950s, chemical insecticides have been the primary method for controlling these bugs, yet resistance has emerged, prompting exploration into alternative approaches. In this investigation, we propose the examination of different concentrations of entomopathogenic nematodes (Heterorhabditis indica) and their symbiotic bacteria (Photorhabdus luminescens) on one ofmexicos key vectors, Triatoma dimidiata, under laboratory conditions. Two experiments were conducted under controlled conditions of temperature (28C) and humidity (70%). The first experiment involved three treatments: 2250, 4500, and 9000 nematodes per milliliter (n/ml) in sterile soil. The second experiment utilized concentrations of 5, 50, 500, and 5000 n/ml. Data were analyzed using survival curves for asymmetric intervals and multiple comparisons tests. Specimens were examined using electron microscopy and histology to assess the presence of nematodes and tissue damage in T. dimidiata. The results of the first experiment demonstrated that the nematode induced an accumulated average mortality ranging from 55.5% (2250 n/ml) to 100% (4500 and 9000 n/ml) within 144 hours. In the second experiment, the 5000 n/ml concentration yielded 87.5% mortality at 86 hours, while the most profitable was 500 n/ml, causing 75% mortality from 84 hours onwards. Survival analysis indicated treatment-induced mortality, with significant differences between treatments and controls. Electron microscopy and histology revealed the presence of nematodes and symbiotic bacteria in T. dimidiatas digestive system, along with tissue damage. Based on these analyses, we assert that the Heterorhabditis indica and Photorhabdus luminescens nematode-bacteria complex can cause mortality in adult Triatoma dimidiata under laboratory conditions Keywords.

La enfermedad de Chagas, causada por el protozoo Trypanosoma cruzi y transmitida principalmente a través de las heces de los insectos Triatominae, es una zoonosis importante en América Latina y se está convirtiendo cada vez más en una preocupación en los Estados Unidos. Desde la década de 1950, los insecticidas químicos han sido el método principal para controlar estos insectos, pero ha surgido resistencia, lo que ha llevado a la exploración de enfoques alternativos. En esta investigación, proponemos el examen de diferentes concentraciones de nematodos entomopatógenos ( Heterorhabditis indica ) y sus bacterias simbióticas ( Photorhabdus luminescens ) en uno de los vectores clave de México, Triatoma dimidiata, en condiciones de laboratorio. Se realizaron dos experimentos en condiciones controladas de temperatura (28C) y humedad (70%). El primer experimento implicó tres tratamientos: 2250, 4500 y 9000 nematodos por mililitro (n/ml) en suelo estéril. El segundo experimento utilizó concentraciones de 5, 50, 500 y 5000 n/ml. Los datos se analizaron mediante curvas de supervivencia para intervalos asimétricos y pruebas de comparaciones múltiples. Las muestras se examinaron mediante microscopía electrónica e histología para evaluar la presencia de nematodos y daño tisular en T. dimidiata .Los resultados del primer experimento demostraron que el nematodo indujo una mortalidad promedio acumulada que oscilaba entre el 55,5% (2250 n/ml) y el 100% (4500 y 9000 n/ml) en 144 horas. En el segundo experimento, la concentración de 5000 n/ml produjo un 87,5% de mortalidad a las 86 horas, mientras que la más rentable fue la de 500 n/ml, provocando un 75% de mortalidad a partir de las 84 horas. El análisis de supervivencia indicó mortalidad inducida por el tratamiento, con diferencias significativas entre tratamientos y controles. La microscopía electrónica y la histología revelaron la presencia de nematodos y bacterias simbióticas en el sistema digestivo de T. dimidiata , junto con daño tisular. Con base en estos análisis, afirmamos que el complejo nematodo-bacteria Heterorhabditis indica y Photorhabdus luminescens puede causar mortalidad en adultos de Triatoma dimidiata en condiciones de laboratorio.

In the Clinic Chagas Disease.,"Hochberg, N. S. and S. P. Montgomery.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20708,2023,"Chagas disease, which is caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a leading neglected tropical disease in the United States. An estimated 240 000 to 350 000 persons in the United States are infected, primarily immigrants frommexico, Central America, and South America, where the disease is endemic. The parasite is transmitted by the triatomine bug but can also be passed through blood transfusion, via organ transplant, or congenitally. Approximately 30% of infected persons later develop cardiac and/or gastrointestinal complications. Health care providers should consider screening at-risk patients with serologic testing. Early diagnosis and treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox can help prevent complications. Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a leading cause of parasitic infection in the United States, with an estimated 240 000 to 350 000 cases (1, 2). In Latin America, an estimated 5.7 million people were infected in 2010 (3). About 1.2 million persons are affected by Chagas cardiomyopathy, and up to 12 000 deaths are estimated to be caused by Chagas disease each year (4, 5), mostly due to severe cardiac complications (6–9)."

Fairley.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20769,2024,"Introduction: Climate change has negatively impacted the agricultural and socioeconomic infrastructure of Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries leading to conditions that promote human migration. It has also led to emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases. This pilot study aimed to identify climate-related drivers of migration and to describe the burden of climate-sensitive neglected tropical diseases (NTD) in immigrants living in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Methods: First generation immigrants from LAC countries living in the Atlanta-metro area were recruited between May and December 2021. Participants completed a survey concerning demographics, socioeconomics, living conditions in their country of origin and living conditions in Atlanta, and motivations for migration. Blood and stool samples were collected to identify Chagas disease and soil-transmitted helminths, and skin exams screened for leprosy and leishmaniasis. Descriptive, univariate, and multivariable analyses of this dataset looked at the association between a climate-driven motivation to migrate and geographic and socioeconomic factors. Results: Fifty-seven individuals were recruited representing 11 LAC countries of origin. Most originated from Central America (n=32; 56%) andmexico(n=13; 23%). Forty-two participants reported a change in climate or weather in their country of origin prior to moving and direct climate drivers of migration(e.g., floods, drought, etc.) were identified by 12 participants (21.1%). Infectious diseases screening found one definitive case of Chagas (2.5%) out of 40 blood samples screened. Food insecurity was significantly associated with a climate-related factor for migrating: aOR = 6.3 (95% CI 1.1, 35.5). Conclusions: While most participants did not directly identify climate change as a reason for migration, our study reveals many factors such as food insecurity, agricultural occupations, and region of origin that may underlie climate-motivated migration. Finding one case of Chagas was also noteworthy and shows the need for improved surveillance for this important NTD."

These compounds can, nevertheless, cause negative effects on environmental and human health as well as induce resistance in triatomines. Therefore, we need to look for more sustainable alternatives. Triatoma pallidipennis is one of the main chagasic vectors inmexico. We evaluated the insecticidal effectiveness of two oils (neem and cinnamon), and two desiccants (potassium salts of fatty acids and diatomaceous earth), on 3rd instar nymphs of T. pallidipennis. The laboratory test involved direct exposure of the treatments to the insects. We found that diatomaceous earths caused 80 % mortality of nymphs after 30 days. Meanwhile, the cumulative mortality for the other treatments did not exceed 50 %. When applied to inert surfaces, the powder formulation of diatomaceous earth demonstrated greater effectiveness than the aqueous suspension. Thus, diatomaceous earth could be a promising alternative for an environmentally friendly control of triatomines."

Molina-Trinidad.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20898,2024,"Triatomines are insect vectors of the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This occurs when the triatomine defecates on the skin of the vertebrate host when it bites its host for feeding. This lesion causes the penetration of T. cruzi, whose infective phase is the tripomastigote, and the non-infective replicative phase epimastigote. Although the effects of T. cruzi on the development and survival of different species of triatomine bugs are known, it has not been fully described how the parasite affects many of the species that inhabitmexico. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of the presence of T. cruzi on triatomine development and survival. For this, five triatomines of each instar of each species, Triatoma barberi and Triatoma longipennis, were inoculated, from their second instar to their adult stage, female or male. Each triatomine was infected with 3-5 x105 parasites and they were incubated for 100 days and the kinetic of parasites in the feces and T. cruzi phases were recorded. The results showed that T. barberi and T. longipennis development was affected in all stages because of T. cruzi infection. It was greater for T. longipennis, both in its mortality, as well as time to molt in each phase."
