"Molecular data confirm Triatoma pallidipennis Stal, 1872 (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae), as a novel cryptic species complex","Cruz, D. D. and E. Arellano.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=15760,2022,"Triatoma pallidipennis constitues one of the most important Chagas disease vector inmexico. Previous studies based on molecular data suggest T. pallidipennis as a complex of cryptic species. For that reason, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of T. pallidipennis using DNA sequences from the mitochondrial ND4 gene and the ITS- 2 gene. In addition, the divergence times were estimated, and possible new taxa were delimited with three species delimitation methods. Finally, genetic distances and possible connectivity routes based on shared haplotypes were obtained among the T. pallidipennis populations. Five haplogroups (possible cryptic species) were found, based on delimitation methods and genetic distances. Haplogroup divergence began about 3 Ma, in the Pleistocene. Moreover, none of the haplogroups showed potential connectivity routes between them, evidencing lack of gene flow. Our results suggest the existence of a new cryptic species complex within what is currently recognized as a T. pallidipennis.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Considerando la problemática actual de las enfermedades reemergentes el presente estudio se realizó con los objetivos de delimitar la distribución actual de T. nitida en Latinoamérica, identificar las variables ambientales de mayor influencia sobre la distribución de la especie para el clima futuro (2041- 2060 y 2081-2100) bajo los escenarios SSP1-2.6 y SSP5-8.5 (GtCO2) e identificar las nuevas zonas con alta idoneidad de hábitat. Se generó una base de datos con 55 registros geográficos. Se descargaron 19 variables bioclimáticas del periodo actual con resolución de 2.5 arc-min. Para la proyección del clima futuro se consideró el modelo de Beijing Climate Center-Climate System Model para los años 2041-2060 y 2081-2100 bajo los escenarios SSP1-2.6 y SSP5-8.5. La superficie estimada para Latinoamérica fue de 2,089,284 km2, abarcando 17 países y 13 estados de México con zonas potenciales para la presencia de la especie. La superficie estimada para los climas futuros fue de 205,515 km2 para 2041-2060 y de 857 km2 para 2081-2100, siendo la mayor distribución en los estados de Oaxaca y Chiapas en México y los países centro y sudamericanos Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela, y Brasil. Se puede señalar que bajo este modelo la tendencia de disminución del área de distribución de T. nitida representa un menor riesgo epidemiológico para la población humana. Aunque la tendencia de los resultados muestran dicha disminución, se encontraron nuevas zonas geográficas de invasión las cuales poseen características climáticas ideales para el establecimiento del vector, lo que podría contribuir a su adaptación, incrementar su capacidad vectorial, así como ampliar la distribución de la enfermedad de Chagas a nuevas zonas de Latinoamérica, por lo anterior es importante considerar las áreas con alta idoneidad de hábitat.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Almeida and K. Michael.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=17228,2022,"Chagas disease (CD) is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and affects 6–7 million people worldwide. The diagnosis is still challenging, due to extensive parasite diversity encompassing seven genotypes (TcI-VI and Tcbat) with diverse ecoepidemiological, biological, and pathological traits. Chemotherapeutic intervention is usually effective but associated with severe adverse events. The development of safer, more effective therapies is hampered by the lack of biomarker(s) (BMKs) for the early assessment of therapeutic outcomes. The mammal-dwelling trypomastigote parasite stage expresses glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored mucins (tGPI-MUC), whose O-glycans are mostly branched with terminal, nonreducing a-galactopyranosyl (a-Gal) glycotopes. These are absent in humans, and thus highly immunogenic and inducers of specific CD anti-a-Gal antibodies. In search for A-Gal-based BMKs, here we describe the synthesis of neoglycoprotein NGP11b, comprised of a carrier protein decorated with the branched trisaccharide Gala(1,2)[Gala(1,6)]GalB. By chemiluminescent immunoassay using sera plasma from chronic CD (CCD) patients from Venezuela andmexicoand healthy controls, NGP11b exhibited sensitivity and specificity similar to that of tGPI-MUC from genotype TcI, predominant in those countries. Preliminary evaluation of CCD patients subjected to chemotherapy showed a significant reduction in anti-a-Gal antibody reactivity to NGP11b. Our data indicated that NGP11b is a potential BMK for diagnosis and treatment assessment in CCD patients.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

The true prevalence of Chagas disease inmexicois unknown. However, it has been estimated that 1.1–4 million people are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi , which represents a potential risk for transmission of the disease via contaminated blood. Aim of the Study. To determine the Chagas disease seroprevalence in donors from eight blood banks in the north ofmexicoCity, and the northeast of the State ofmexico. Study Design and Methods. Serum samples from blood donors ( n = 515,038) were tested to detect the presence of anti- Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies in eight blood banks. The serologic screening test was performed in each of the blood banks. To confirm the seropositive blood donors, only two out of the eight blood banks used a test with a different principle with the aim of identifying anti- Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies. All tests were validated by the Mexican Institute for Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference. Results. One thousand two hundred and ten blood donors were seropositive for Try- panosoma cruzi , which represents a 0.23% seroprevalence (95% CI 0.22–0.25%). Of the seropositive blood donors, 97.03 % resided in the northeast area of the State ofmexico,mexicoCity, and southern part of the State of Hidalgo. Conclusions.

Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze trends in mortality caused by IHD in the region of the Americas from 2000 to 2019. Methods: Estimates of the age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) due to IHD were extracted from the Data Portal on Noncommunicable Diseases, Mental Health, and External Causes (ENLACE), Pan American Health Organization. We used Joinpoint regression to analyze significant changes in mortality trends by country, gender, geographical sub-region, and country income, according to the World Bank classification. We also calculated the average annual percent change (AAPC) mortality rate for the overall period in the Americas as a whole and by country and sub-region. Results: In the region of the Americas, the AAMR from IHD decreased from 117.80 (95% uncertainty interval (UI)) 106.64–135.90) in 2000 to 73.64 (62.65–92.66) per 100,000 in 2019. In males, from 149.08 (95% UI 138.23–168.08) to 96.02 (95% UI 83.48–117.19) and in females 92.36 (95% UI 81.35–109.42) to 54.84 (95% UI 45.28– 71.76). The AAPC mortality rate in the region decreased –2.5% (95% CI: –2.7, –2.3), with joinpoints in 2007 and 2012, –2.3% (95% CI: –2.5, –2.1) in men and –2.7% (95% CI: –3.0, –2.5) in women. According to the sub-region analysis, the highest decrease was recorded in North America, AAPC –3.1% (95% CI: –3.3, –3.0) with one joinpoint in 2011, whereas there was a stagnation of the mortality rate in Central America,mexico, and Latin Caribbean with an AAPC of 0.1 (–0.2, 0.3) with one joinpoint in 2007. Conclusions: Age-adjusted mortality rate from IHD between 2000 and 2019 has decreased in the region of the Americas. However, different trends were observed, North America had the highest reduction in AAPC, while Central America,mexico, and Latin Caribbean Region had a stagnation. This trend was highly influenced by country income.",,,,,,,,,,left_only
Reactions to bites from kissing bugs (primarily genus Triatoma),"Goddard, J. and R. D. deShazo.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=17762,2022,"Triatoma insects (colloquial names include kissing bug, Mexican bed bug, and cone-nosed bug) are found primarily in the western and southern United States, Central and South America, andmexico(picture 1 and picture 2). Kissing bug bites are usually painless and undetected by the victim. However, these insects are of medical importance both because they can transmit the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease, and also because people can develop life-threatening allergic reactions to their bites. Local reactions to Triatoma bites, most commonly consisting of erythema and edema around the puncture sites (picture 3), develop in some patients and are managed symptomatically. (See 'Local reactions' above.) Allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to Triatoma bites typically occur in the middle of the night, as Triatoma are nocturnal and bite while the victim sleeps. With the exception of this one distinguishing feature, the signs and symptoms of Triatoma anaphylaxis may be identical to those resulting from other triggers. Fatal and near-fatal cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. Acute treatment of anaphylaxis following a Triatoma bite is identical to acute treatment of anaphylaxis of any etiology.Upon discharge, all patients with anaphylaxis should be equipped with an epinephrine autoinjector and an anaphylaxis emergency action plan to manage initial treatment of recurrent episodes. Epinephrine should be kept at the bedside in the future. Once a patient with anaphylaxis has been stabilized, the home (or relevant site) should be thoroughly searched for the blood-engorged insect as soon as possible.If necessary, pest management professionals may be called upon to aid in the inspection process.Identification of the insect is important for diagnosis because reagents for skin testing and laboratory diagnosis are not available.Proper insect identification can be obtained from a local college or university entomology department or the extension service at participating land-grant universities nationwide. Patients should be given information about how to prevent future contact with Triatoma, including modifications of their homes, bedrooms, and surrounding environment.If kissing bugs are suspected to be present or found in the home, a pest management professional should be contacted. Specific immunotherapy to reduce an allergic patient's sensitivity to Triatoma is not commercially available.Thus, avoidance and education about early recognition and treatment of recurrent allergic reactions is critical.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Resultados: La reactividad de las tres pruebas osciló entre el 70,5 % para el ELISA de Wiener y, para las pruebas rápidas, el 81,0% para T-Detect y el 90,4 % para Stat- Pak. La reactividad de las pruebas varió significativamente entre países, siendo mayor en Argentina y menor en México. Considerando al menos dos pruebas serológicas reactivas para confirmación, menos de 12 % de los casos en Argentina no fueron detectados, más de 21 % en Honduras y más de 72 % en México. Las diferencias en el rendimiento de la prueba entre países no se asociaron con la parasitemia, sino con diferencias en los valores de anticuerpos contra los antígenos ELISA. Conclusiones: Tanto las diferencias geográficas en las cepas de T. cruzi, como las diferencias genéticas entre las poblaciones humanas, pudieron contribuir a las discrepancias en las pruebas.

METHODS We used samples from various organs (heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, spleen, liver, esophagus, and stomach) corresponding to individuals of gray fox and spotted skunk, captured in the peridomicile of eight rural localities of Yucatan between the period 1990–2008. The presence of T. cruzi DNA in tissue samples was determined by PCR technique and histopathology study. RESULTS All the individuals studied had at least one tissue sample with T. cruzi DNA. The esophagus (9/13), heart (7/13), and skeletal muscle (6/13) were the organs with the highest frequency of T. cruzi DNA. No nests of amastigotes were found, however, microscopic observation revealed lesions characteristic of T. cruzi infection, such as inflammatory infiltrate by lymphocytes and histiocytes with or without necrosis of cardiomyocytes cells, and proliferation of fibrocytes, fibroblasts and collagen fibers (fibrosis). CONCLUSIONS Our results confirm that these two wild carnivores are natural hosts for T. cruzi in Yucatan,mexico. The synanthropic behavior of these two mammals in Yucatan makes it necessary to focus future studies on their role within the rural peridomiciliary transmission cycle of T. cruzi in the Yucatan Peninsula.

Up to 8 million individuals inmexico, Central America, and South America are estimated to be infected with Chagas disease, the majority of whom are unaware of their condition. Infection is a chronic and potentially fatal condition if left untreated. Drugs that are currently on the market were empirically developed more than three decades ago. Purpose As a result, they frequently have severe side effects and low efficacy, especially in the common chronic form of the condition. Hence, this has resulted in searching for alternative therapeutic options to control this disease, and natural products could be explored to this effect. Method We employed molecular dynamics simulation and binding energy analyses to decipher and unravel the mechanistic inhibitory potential of five selected natural compounds as potential inhibitors of T. cruzi glucokinase for treating Chagas disease as an alternative therapy. Results The results revealed that CPD3 (ZINC 000002345225) displayed the highest binding activity, with a total binding energy of -35.16 kcal/mol, compared to other compounds. The PRED approach identified crucial moieties of CPD3 and several molecular interactions prominent in its binding activity, such as Hydrogen Bond, Alkyl, and Pi-Alkyl. ASN 308, GLY 306, LEU 187, THR 185, GLY 184, and ALA 182 played significant roles in the effective binding activity of CPD3, as evidenced in their steady complementary multiple interactions exhibited throughout the simulation period. In this study, we recommend CPD3 as a promising lead compound that can further promote more experimental investigations for the design of drugs for Chagas disease, thereby addressing the limitations of current therapy options. Conclusion These results showed that natural compounds could be potential candidates against the inhibition of T. cruzi glucokinase for treating Chagas disease as an alternative therapy.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

"Análise do status genérico e específico de Meccus Stal, 1859 (Hemiptera, Triatominae)","Cesaretto, N. R.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=18873,2023,"O gênero Meccus é composto por seis espécies que apresentam distribuição restrita ao México, onde são responsáveis por 67% das transmissões vetoriais de Trypanosoma cruzi para humanos. A taxonomia de Meccus é bastante complexa, uma vez que o gênero já foi alterado diversas vezes: em 1859 foi descrito como Meccus; no entanto, em 1979, as espécies desse gênero foram agrupadas em Triatoma. Em 2000, o gênero Meccus foi revalidado pela estreita relação morfológica, bem como sinapomorfias das espécies agrupadas nesse gênero (dados confirmados por análises moleculares). Além disso, o gênero Meccus é um grupo parafilético, uma vez que M. longipennis é mais próximo filogeneticamente de Triatoma do que dos outros Meccus. Existem diversas propostas de reorganização taxonômicas para os grupos pertencentes à tribo Triatomini. Entre elas, sugere-se que Meccus, Mepraia e Nesotriatoma sejam gêneros ou complexos de espécies pertencentes ao gênero Triatoma. Cruzamentos experimentais entre espécies agrupadas em gêneros diferentes, em geral, não resultam em híbridos, ou seja, existem barreiras reprodutivas pré-zigóticas instaladas. Assim, o presente estudo teve como objetivo realizar cruzamentos experimentais entre M. longipennis e T. mopan, com o intuito de avaliar o status genérico de Meccus. Além disso, revisitamos questões genéticas, taxonômicas e evolutivas relacionadas com o status específico das seis espécies que compõem o gênero Meccus. Híbridos foram obtidos para o cruzamento entre  T. mopan x T. longipennis, demonstrando que não existe barreira reprodutiva pré-zigótica instalada entre Meccus e Triatoma. Além disso, informações genéticas, taxonômicas e evolutivas revisitadas confirmaram o status específico das espécies inicialmente agrupadas no gênero Meccus. Nossos resultados demonstram que Meccus não é um gênero válido (o que resultou na sua sinonimização com Triatoma) e ressaltam que T. bassolsae, T. longipennis, T. mazzottii, T. pallidipennis, T. phyllosoma e T. picturata são espécies válidas.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Chagas as a potential aetiology of dilated cardiomyopathy remains under-recognized. We present a case where multimodality imaging was essential in the diagnosis and management of Chagas heart disease. Case summary A 54-year-old man, originally frommexico, presented to the emergency department with chest pain and recurrent syncopal episodes, found to be in haemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring urgent cardioversion. Urgent coronary angiography revealed no obstructive disease. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed moderately reduced left ventricular systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction 35–40%) with apical akinesis and an aneurysm of the apical septum. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) confirmed a prominent apical aneurysm with dyskinesis of the apical septum, with the evidence of transmural myocardial late gadolinium enhancement of the entire left ventricular apex and a small apical thrombus. Serologic testing was positive for Trypanosoma cruzi IgG antibody, which was confirmed on repeat testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Patient underwent VT ablation and was discharged on guideline-directed medical therapy including a regimen of anticoagulation, beta-blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapies. He has had no subsequent syncope or VT. Discussion Chagas heart disease remains under-recognized and under-diagnosed despite the growing burden of T. cruzi infection in the USA. Suspicion for Chagas heart disease should be considered in patients presenting with heart failure symptoms and ventricular arrhythmias with the right corresponding history and imaging findings on echocardiogram and CMR.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Honorio.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=19189,2023,"Chagas disease, after more than a century after its discovery, is still a major public health problem. It is estimated that approximately 10 million people worldwide are infected with T. cruzi. However, the situation is more critical in Latin America and other regions where the disease is endemic. The largest number of cases occurs in Brazil, Argentina, andmexicoas more than 100 million people in these regions are located in areas with a high risk of contamination by the vector. The need for new therapeutic alternatives is urgent, as the available drugs have severe limitations such as low efficacy and high toxicity. From this scenario, in this work, we employed the virtual screening technique using cruzain and BDF2 as key biological targets for the survival of the parasite. Our objective was to identify potential inhibitors of T. cruzi trypomastigotes, which could be considered drug candidates against Chagas disease. For this, we employed different in silico methodologies and the obtained results were corroborated using in vitro biological assays. For the VS studies, a database containing synthetic compounds was simulated at the binding site of cruzain and BDF2. In addition, pharmacophoric models were constructed in the initial phases of VS, as well as other advanced analyses (molecular dynamics simulations, calculations of binding free energy, and ADME prediction) were carried out and the results allowed the selection of potential inhibitors of T. cruzi. Based on the obtained data, 32 different compounds commercially available were subjected to biological tests against the trypomastigote form of T. cruzi. As result, 11 of those compounds displayed significant activity against T. cruzi and can be considered potential candidates for the treatment of Chagas disease.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Methods: A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted between March 2014 and October 2019 among Latin American migrants in six cities in Germany to obtain information on migration history, socioeconomic and insurance status, knowledge about CD, potential risk factors for Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and willingness to donate blood or organs. Results: 168 participants completed the questionnaire. The four countries with the highest proportion of participants contributing to the study population were Colombia,mexico, Peru and Ecuador. Before migrating to Europe, the majority of the study population resided in an urban setting in houses made of stone or concrete, had higher academic education and was integrated into the German healthcare and healthcare insurance system. The majority of all study participants were also willing to donate blood and organs and a quarter of them had donated blood previously. However, many participants lacked basic knowledge about symptoms and modes of transmission of Chagas disease. One out of 56 serologic tests (1.8%) performed was positive. The seropositive female participant born in Argentina had a negative PCR test and no signs of cardiac or other organ involvement. Conclusions: The study population does not reflect the population structure at risk for T. cruzi infection in endemic countries. Most participants had a low risk profile for infection with T. cruzi. Although the sample size was small and sampling was not representative of all persons at risk in Germany, the seroprevalence found was similar to studies previously conducted in Europe. As no systematic screening for T. cruzi in Latin American blood and organ donors as well as in women of child-bearing age of Latin American origin is implemented in Germany, a risk of occasional transmission of T. cruzi remains.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

It is estimated that around 6 million people are currently infected with the parasite in Latin America, and 25 million live in endemic areas with active transmission. The disease causes an estimated economic loss of USD 24 billion dollars annually, with a loss of 75,200 working years per year of life; it is responsible for around ~12,000 deaths annually. Althoughmexicois an endemic country that recorded 10,186 new cases of Chagas disease during the period of 1990–2017, few studies have evaluated the genetic diversity of genes that could be involved in the prophylaxis and/or diagnosis of the parasite. One of the possible candidates proposed as a vaccine target is the 24 kDa trypomastigote excretory–secretory protein, Tc24, whose protection is linked to the stimulation of T. cruzi-specific CD8+ immune responses. (2) Methods: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the fine-scale genetic diversity and structure of Tc24 in T. cruzi isolates frommexico, and to compare them with other populations reported in the Americas with the aim to reconsider the potential role of Tc24 as a key candidate for the prophylaxis and improvement of the diagnosis of Chagas disease inmexico. (3) Results: Of the 25 Mexican isolates analysed, 48% (12) were recovered from humans and 24% (6) recovered from Triatoma barberi and Triatoma dimidiata. Phylogenetic inferences revealed a polytomy in the T. cruzi clade with two defined subgroups, one formed by all sequences of the DTU I and the other formed by DTU II–VI; both subgroups had high branch support. Genetic population analysis detected a single (monomorphic) haplotype of TcI throughout the entire distribution across bothmexicoand South America. This information was supported by Nei’s pairwise distances, where the sequences of TcI showed no genetic differences. (4) Conclusions: Given that both previous studies and the findings of the present work confirmed that TcI is the only genotype detected from human isolates obtained from various states ofmexico, and that there is no significant genetic variability in any of them, it is possible to propose the development of in silico strategies for the production of antigens that optimise the diagnosis of Chagas disease, such as quantitative ELISA methods that use this region of Tc24.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Es endémica en 21 países de América Central y Sudamérica (según datos de la OMS), en el área comprendida entre México y Argentina (exceptuando las islas del Caribe); aunque debido a los movimientos migratorios que se han producido en las últimas décadas en todo el mundo, la enfermedad actualmente puede ser diagnosticada en cualquier país, principalmente de Norteamérica y Europa. Se estima que unos 6-7 millones de personas están infectadas de forma global en el mundo, y se diagnostican aproximadamente 30 mil casos nuevos anuales (OMS), por todas las formas de transmisión. Se producen un promedio de 12.000 muertes al año y aproximadamente unos 8.600 recién nacidos (RN) nacen al año con la enfermedad, tras haberse infectado durante la gestación. Dentro de Europa, España es el país con mayor número de personas con EC, siendo aquellas originarias de Bolivia las que representan la mayoría de los casos, alcanzando el 81% del total. Se puede transmitir por: a) vía vectorial: tras la picadura de un insecto de la familia de los triatominos (conocido como chinche “del beso”, vinchuca, chipo o chiribico según las localizaciones geográficas), produciéndose el paso a la sangre del parásito por el rascado de la piel b) transfusión o trasplante de órganos; c) vía vertical, desde la mujer embarazada a su hijo (vía de transmisión principal en nuestro medio y el resto de áreas no endémicas); y d) vía oral (alimentos contaminados con las heces de los insectos vectores) y accidente de laboratorio; siendo estas dos vías poco frecuentes. La mujer gestante infectada puede estar asintomática y por tanto desconocer el riesgo de transmisión vertical. Ésta oscila en torno al 2% en áreas no endémicas y alcanza el 4-6% en algunas zonas endémicas1. La enfermedad podría pasar desapercibida durante los primeros años de vida del niño y diagnosticarse ya en fase crónica.

We performed a systematic sampling of wild mammals in 11 states ofmexico, from 2017 to 2018.

The standardized infection risk of T. cruzi of our examined specimens was similar, no matter the host species or their geographic origins. Additionally, we used published data of mammal positives for T. cruzi to complement records of T. cruzi infection in wild mammals and inferred a trophic network of Triatoma spp. (vectors) and wild mammal species inmexico, using spatial data-mining modelling. Infection with T. cruzi was not homogeneously distributed in the inferred trophic network. This information allowed us to develop a predictive model for T. cruzi infection risk for wild mammals inmexico, considering risk as a function of the diversity of vector-host spatial associations in a large-scale geographic context, finding that the addition of competent vectors to a multi-host parasite system amplifies host infection risk.

Nevertheless, it shows a tolerant behavior to anthropogenic disturbance, with adult bugs frequently infesting human dwellings, principally during the warm and dry season. Yet, whether the temporal variation of abundance is independent of the habitat and how this is related to the infection rate with Trypanosoma cruzi in Yucatan is still poorly understood. The objective of this study was to simultaneously analyze the temporal variations of T. dimidiata abundance and infection with T. cruzi in domestic and sylvatic habitats from two localities of rural Yucatan (Sudzal, 20 52 19 N, 88 59 20 W and Teya, 21 02 55 N, 89 04 25 W) to help for the further improvement of locally adapted strategies aimed at controlling T. cruzi vector transmission. Using community participation and a combination of different trapping techniques, we collected T. dimidiata bugs during 29 consecutive months within domestic and sylvatic habitats. We then assessed by PCR the infection of the bugs with T. cruzi. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the effect of climatic variables on the abundance of T. dimidiata and the effect of bug sex, season and habitat on the prevalence of infection with T. cruzi. Overall, 3640 specimens of T. dimidiata were collected. We clearly observed peaks of maximum abundance in both habitats during the warm and dry season and found a negative association of bug abundance with relative humidity. The overall prevalence of infection of the bugs with T. cruzi was 15.2 %. Additionally, bugs collected in domestic habitats displayed a significantly higher prevalence of infection than sylvatic bugs (19.6% vs. 6.1 %, respectively), suggesting an increased risk of T. cruzi transmission related with anthropogenic disturbance. Our study is the first to describe the annual pattern of abundance of T. dimidiata in sylvatic habitats of rural Yucatan and constitutes a contribution to the knowledge of T. dimidiata ecology and of T. cruzi transmission cycle dynamics in the region. In Yucatan, where the use of mosquito nets has shown to be effective to limit human dwelling infestation by T. dimidiata, reinforcing the awareness of local residents about the increased risk of T. cruzi transmission during the warm and dry season when realizing activities in the sylvatic ambient should be, among others, also considered to improve control strategies and limit the risk of vector transmission.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

En Morelos, existen grupos de científicos que realizan investigaciones sobre el control de la población de chinches, así como estudios para conocer el número real de afectados por la enfermedad. Entre estos destacan los grupos liderados por el Dr. Celso Ramos y Dr. Mario Henry del Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública. Además, el Dr. Chimal de la Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos, quien fue pionero en investigar la enfermedad de Chagas en exdonadores de sangre humana, a través de pruebas moleculares, como la Reacción en Cadena de la Polimerasa, mejor conocida como PCR. Esta prueba se realiza utilizando pequeñísimas cantidades de ADN y ayuda a confirmar la infección por el parásito. Un objetivo importante de estas investigaciones es desarrollar nuevas técnicas moleculares para facilitar el diagnóstico. También se han realizado estudios poblacionales en embarazadas, niños, hombres y donadores, en diversos países de Latinoamérica, con la finalidad de calcular con exactitud el número de personas afectadas y tener datos reales que pongan en evidencia la importancia del diagnóstico y tratamiento oportuno, así como la necesidad de apoyar a las personas que desarrollan complicaciones cardíacas. Además, diferentes grupos de científicos están investigando antígenos que puedan ser utilizados en el desarrollo de vacunas para así evitar las secuelas de la etapa crónica. Con base en los resultados de dichos estudios, se está proponiendo que algunas de estas nuevas pruebas moleculares se integren de forma obligatoria para realizar el tamizaje en todas las mujeres embarazadas y en todos los centros de transfusión sanguínea del país, con el objetivo de disminuir la propagación de la enfermedad de Chagas. Los chagólogos participan activamente en la difusión y concientización de la enfermedad, a través de la integración de asociaciones sin fines de lucro. Un ejemplo es la Asociación Chagas con Ciencia y Conocimiento, que genera y difunde el conocimiento obtenido en los laboratorios de investigación y trabaja en impulsar una política integral en conjunto con las autoridades de salud para combatir la enfermedad de Chagas. Gracias a esa labor de difusión y concientización de diferentes asociaciones de América Latina, la Organización Panamericana de la Salud (OPS) declaró el 14 de abril como el Día Mundial de la Enfermedad de Chagas. Este es un espacio de debate y discusión desde el punto de vista científico, con autoridades de los sistemas de salud, para mejorar la atención y apoyo a todos los afectados. Es importante que sepas que, si tú o un familiar sufren de las secuelas crónicas de Chagas, existen asociaciones mexicanas no gubernamentales que brindan apoyo. Entre ellas está la Asociación Mexicana de Personas Afectadas por la Enfermedad de Chagas (AMEPACH) que actúa como enlace con los sistemas de salud para facilitar el tratamiento a pacientes afectados crónicamente. Otra asociación relevante es Salvando Latidos, que está integrada por cardiólogos que brindan atención clínica especializado a pacientes con secuelas cardiacas crónicas en estado de vulnerabilidad; asimismo, brindan asesoría a médicos que quieran capacitarse para el diagnóstico oportuno de la enfermedad de Chagas y evitar que se diagnostique sólo tomando en cuenta un lugar visitado y el buen humor, como en Dr. House.",,,,,,,,,,left_only
Guías Latinoamericanas de Infecciones Congénitas y Perinatales de la Sociedad Latinoamericana de Infectología Pediátrica (SLIPE). Parte I - Enfermedad de Chagas,"Altcheh, J., G. Moscatelli and S. Moroni.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20455,2024,"La enfermedad de Chagas, causada por el parásito Trypanosoma cruzi, afecta a cerca de 6-8 millones de personas en el mundo. En áreas endémicas como México, América Central o América del Sur, la mayoría de las infecciones son transmitidas por el vector Triatoma infestans. Sin embargo, la infección también puede ser adquirida de forma congénita, a través de transfusiones de sangre, trasplante de órganos, contaminación de líquidos o alimentos, o accidentes laborales[82-84]. El plan de lucha contra el vector y las mejoras en los controles de los hemoderivados impulsado por las diferentes iniciativas de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) posibilitó disminuir la incidencia de nuevos casos vectoriales en áreas rurales y o aquellos producidos por transfusiones [85,86[. Por otro lado, las migraciones crecientes desde zonas rurales hacia áreas urbanas comunes en América Latina cambiaron el patrón epidemiológico tradicional y diseminándose también a países de Europa y Asia[87,88]. Actualmente, en regiones de Latinoamérica como Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay y Uruguay, donde existe un control parcial del vector, otras vías de transmisión como la transplacentaria cobran importancia epidemiológica (Figura 9)[89].  Se estima que en la Región de las Américas existen cerca de dos millones de mujeres en edad reproductiva infectadas por T. cruzi, de las cuales 3 a 10% transmitirán la infección al feto por vía transplacentaria, con un promedio anual de 8.000 nacimientos de infantes con enfermedad de Chagas adquirida en forma vertical89. En el último informe de la OPS del año 2022 los países que reportaron seroprevalencia para la enfermedad de Chagas en recién nacidos (RNs) expuestos en el año 2020 fueron: Bolivia (n: 76), Argentina (n: 37), Chile (n: 20) y Paraguay (n: 3) [89]. La transmisión transplacentaria representa alrededor de 40% del total de los casos de enfermedad de Chagas, y se calcula una transmisión de enfermedad congénita de entre 2 y 8% [90]. Existe seguramente, un subregistro de casos ya que la prevalencia en mujeres gestantes de otras regiones endémicas es mayor; tal es el caso de Bolivia, que con 9 a 15% de afectación en embarazo, debería arrojar mayor número de casos transplacentarios [89]. En Argentina, la prevalencia de infección en la mujer embarazada oscila entre 1 y 13%. Entre los países de América Latina y el Caribe con mayores tasas de incidencia por 1.000 nacidos vivos estimada para el año 2010 destacan Paraguay (3,4), Belice (3,3), Ecuador (3,2), Bolivia (2,3), Argentina (2,1), El Salvador (1,9), Honduras (1,3), Nicaragua (1,2), Colombia (1,1) y Venezuela (1,1) (Figura 10) [91]. Desde el año 2010, la OPS ha incorporado a la iniciativa ETMI plus a la enfermedad de Chagas con el objetivo de eliminar la vía de transmisión transplacentaria, dado que constituye un gran problema de salud pública [2]. Es necesario implementar el tamizaje en mujeres embarazadas como parte de la atención prenatal universal, junto con la vigilancia, el diagnóstico y el tratamiento de todos los RNs cuyas madres están infectadas [92,93]. Se ha comprobado que el tratamiento es efectivo y puede lograr una curación completa si se establece en los primeros meses de vida (Tabla 6) [94,95]. La recomendación actual sugiere dar tratamiento con benznidazol y nifurtimox a las mujeres en edad fértil y a las madres con seropositividad para T. cruzi después del embarazo dado que el mismo evita la transmisión transplacentaria y evita la aparición  de nuevos casos.",,,,,,,,,,left_only
Heterorhabditis indica a possible new biological control agent against the vector of Chagas disease,"Smith-Avila, S., C. Ibarra-Cerdeña, J. E. Barranco-Florido and V. M. Vidal-Martínez.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20633,2024,"Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi mainly transmitted through the feces of Triatominae bugs, is a significant zoonosis in Latin America and is increasingly becoming a concern in the USA. Since the 1950s, chemical insecticides have been the primary method for controlling these bugs, yet resistance has emerged, prompting exploration into alternative approaches. In this investigation, we propose the examination of different concentrations of entomopathogenic nematodes (Heterorhabditis indica) and their symbiotic bacteria (Photorhabdus luminescens) on one ofmexicos key vectors, Triatoma dimidiata, under laboratory conditions. Two experiments were conducted under controlled conditions of temperature (28C) and humidity (70%). The first experiment involved three treatments: 2250, 4500, and 9000 nematodes per milliliter (n/ml) in sterile soil. The second experiment utilized concentrations of 5, 50, 500, and 5000 n/ml. Data were analyzed using survival curves for asymmetric intervals and multiple comparisons tests. Specimens were examined using electron microscopy and histology to assess the presence of nematodes and tissue damage in T. dimidiata. The results of the first experiment demonstrated that the nematode induced an accumulated average mortality ranging from 55.5% (2250 n/ml) to 100% (4500 and 9000 n/ml) within 144 hours. In the second experiment, the 5000 n/ml concentration yielded 87.5% mortality at 86 hours, while the most profitable was 500 n/ml, causing 75% mortality from 84 hours onwards. Survival analysis indicated treatment-induced mortality, with significant differences between treatments and controls. Electron microscopy and histology revealed the presence of nematodes and symbiotic bacteria in T. dimidiatas digestive system, along with tissue damage. Based on these analyses, we assert that the Heterorhabditis indica and Photorhabdus luminescens nematode-bacteria complex can cause mortality in adult Triatoma dimidiata under laboratory conditions Keywords. Kissing bug, Trypanosoma cruzi, Disease, Biological control. La enfermedad de Chagas, causada por el protozoo Trypanosoma cruzi y transmitida principalmente a través de las heces de los insectos Triatominae, es una zoonosis importante en América Latina y se está convirtiendo cada vez más en una preocupación en los Estados Unidos. Desde la década de 1950, los insecticidas químicos han sido el método principal para controlar estos insectos, pero ha surgido resistencia, lo que ha llevado a la exploración de enfoques alternativos. En esta investigación, proponemos el examen de diferentes concentraciones de nematodos entomopatógenos ( Heterorhabditis indica ) y sus bacterias simbióticas ( Photorhabdus luminescens ) en uno de los vectores clave de México, Triatoma dimidiata, en condiciones de laboratorio. Se realizaron dos experimentos en condiciones controladas de temperatura (28C) y humedad (70%). El primer experimento implicó tres tratamientos: 2250, 4500 y 9000 nematodos por mililitro (n/ml) en suelo estéril. El segundo experimento utilizó concentraciones de 5, 50, 500 y 5000 n/ml. Los datos se analizaron mediante curvas de supervivencia para intervalos asimétricos y pruebas de comparaciones múltiples. Las muestras se examinaron mediante microscopía electrónica e histología para evaluar la presencia de nematodos y daño tisular en T. dimidiata .Los resultados del primer experimento demostraron que el nematodo indujo una mortalidad promedio acumulada que oscilaba entre el 55,5% (2250 n/ml) y el 100% (4500 y 9000 n/ml) en 144 horas. En el segundo experimento, la concentración de 5000 n/ml produjo un 87,5% de mortalidad a las 86 horas, mientras que la más rentable fue la de 500 n/ml, provocando un 75% de mortalidad a partir de las 84 horas. El análisis de supervivencia indicó mortalidad inducida por el tratamiento, con diferencias significativas entre tratamientos y controles. La microscopía electrónica y la histología revelaron la presencia de nematodos y bacterias simbióticas en el sistema digestivo de T. dimidiata , junto con daño tisular. Con base en estos análisis, afirmamos que el complejo nematodo-bacteria Heterorhabditis indica y Photorhabdus luminescens puede causar mortalidad en adultos de Triatoma dimidiata en condiciones de laboratorio.

Fairley.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20769,2024,"Introduction: Climate change has negatively impacted the agricultural and socioeconomic infrastructure of Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries leading to conditions that promote human migration. It has also led to emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases. This pilot study aimed to identify climate-related drivers of migration and to describe the burden of climate-sensitive neglected tropical diseases (NTD) in immigrants living in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Methods: First generation immigrants from LAC countries living in the Atlanta-metro area were recruited between May and December 2021. Participants completed a survey concerning demographics, socioeconomics, living conditions in their country of origin and living conditions in Atlanta, and motivations for migration. Blood and stool samples were collected to identify Chagas disease and soil-transmitted helminths, and skin exams screened for leprosy and leishmaniasis. Descriptive, univariate, and multivariable analyses of this dataset looked at the association between a climate-driven motivation to migrate and geographic and socioeconomic factors. Results: Fifty-seven individuals were recruited representing 11 LAC countries of origin. Most originated from Central America (n=32; 56%) andmexico(n=13; 23%). Forty-two participants reported a change in climate or weather in their country of origin prior to moving and direct climate drivers of migration(e.g., floods, drought, etc.) were identified by 12 participants (21.1%). Infectious diseases screening found one definitive case of Chagas (2.5%) out of 40 blood samples screened. Food insecurity was significantly associated with a climate-related factor for migrating: aOR = 6.3 (95% CI 1.1, 35.5). Conclusions: While most participants did not directly identify climate change as a reason for migration, our study reveals many factors such as food insecurity, agricultural occupations, and region of origin that may underlie climate-motivated migration. Finding one case of Chagas was also noteworthy and shows the need for improved surveillance for this important NTD.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Consistent with prior seroprevalence studies, Chagas disease is rare, and identifying those at highest risk of infection remains a challenge. As a result, universal screening of children born in Latin America may be the optimal method for identifying asymptomatic infections. Among those children born in theunitedstatesto mothers who lived in Latin America, maternal screening is likely a more cost-efficient approach than testing all secondgeneration children. Early identification of Chagas disease enables children to receive well-tolerated, highly effective antiparasitic medications, preventing severe morbidity during adulthood.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

D. Roachell, T. L. Cropper and S. A. Hamer.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=17263,2022,"Background Triatomine insects, vectors of the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), are challenging to locate in sylvatic habitats. Collection techniques used in theunitedstatesoften rely on methods to intercept seasonally dispersing adults or on community scientists’ encounters. Neither method is suited for detecting nidicolous habitats, which is important for vector control. Furthermore, manual inspection of suspected harborages is unlikely to reveal novel locations and host associations. Similar to a team that used a trained dog to detect sylvatic triatomines in Paraguay, we worked with a trained scent detection dog to detect sylvatic locations of triatomines across Texas. Principle methodology Findings Ziza, a 3-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer previously naturally infected with T. cruzi, was trained to detect triatomines. Over the course of 6 weeks in the fall of 2017, the dog and her handler visited 18 sites across Texas. The dog detected 60 triatomines at 7 locations; an additional 50 triatomines were contemporaneously collected at these sites without the assistance of the dog. Approximately 0.98 triatomines per hour were found when only humans were conducting searches; when working with the dog, approximately 1.71 triatomines per hour were found. In total, 3 adults and 107 nymphs of four species (Triatoma gerstaeckeri, Triatoma protracta, Triatoma sanguisuga, and Triatoma indictiva) were collected. PCR testing of a subset revealed T. cruzi infection, including DTUs TcI and TcIV, in 28% of nymphs (n=100) and 66% of adults (n=3). Blood meal analysis of a subset of triatomines (n=5) revealed feeding on Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus) and eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus). Conclusion Significance A trained scent detection dog enhanced triatomine detections in sylvatic habitats. This approach is especially effective at detecting triatomine nymphs and nidicolous locations. With new knowledge of specific sylvatic habitats and key hosts fed upon by triatomines, there are opportunities for continued exploration of novel vector control methods to block the transmission of T. cruzi to humans and domestic animals.",,,,,,,,,,left_only
How does academia respond to the burden of infectious and parasitic disease?,"Zhao, W., L. Wang and L. Zhang.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=17316,2022,"Background: Academic research is one of the main avenues through which humans can fight the threat of infectious diseases. However, there have been concerns regarding whether the academic system has provided sufficient efforts to fight infectious diseases we potentially face. Answering these questions could contribute to evidence-based recommendations for setting research priorities and third-mission policies. Methods: With a focus on one of the most common categories of communicable diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases (IPDs), we searched Web of Science for articles and reviews relevant to IPDs published during the period 2000–2019 and retrieved WHO data on disease burden in corresponding years. The academic response patterns were explored by IPD subcategory and by human development level (an index established by theunitedNations). We conduct the analysis in particular to gain insight into the dynamic relationship between disease burden and research effort on IPDs, scientific efforts contributed by countries with different development levels, and the variation trends in international joint efforts. Results: The greatest burden of IPDs is clustered in the developing regions of Africa, but has received academic response from both developed and developing countries. Highly developed countries dominate the ranks of academic research in this area, yet there is also a clear increase in research efforts from the countries most affected, despite their low human development scale. In fact, the overall analysis reveals an improved capability for addressing local problems from African regions. In terms of international collaboration, highly developed countries such as theunitedstatesandunitedKingdom have commonly collaborated with needy regions, whereas prolific but developing nations, like China, have not. Conclusions: From a global perspective, academia has positively responded to health needs caused by IPDs. Although the relevant research output contribution is primarily from the highly developed countries, concentrated and specialized efforts from the undeveloped regions to ease their local burden can be clearly observed. Our findings also indicate a tendency to focus more on local health needs for both developed and undeveloped regions. The insights revealed in this study should benefit a more informed and systemic plan of research priorities.",,,,,,,,,,left_only
Reactions to bites from kissing bugs (primarily genus Triatoma),"Goddard, J. and R. D. deShazo.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=17762,2022,"Triatoma insects (colloquial names include kissing bug, Mexican bed bug, and cone-nosed bug) are found primarily in the western and southernunitedstates, Central and South America, and Mexico (picture 1 and picture 2). Kissing bug bites are usually painless and undetected by the victim. However, these insects are of medical importance both because they can transmit the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease, and also because people can develop life-threatening allergic reactions to their bites. Local reactions to Triatoma bites, most commonly consisting of erythema and edema around the puncture sites (picture 3), develop in some patients and are managed symptomatically. (See 'Local reactions' above.) Allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to Triatoma bites typically occur in the middle of the night, as Triatoma are nocturnal and bite while the victim sleeps. With the exception of this one distinguishing feature, the signs and symptoms of Triatoma anaphylaxis may be identical to those resulting from other triggers. Fatal and near-fatal cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. Acute treatment of anaphylaxis following a Triatoma bite is identical to acute treatment of anaphylaxis of any etiology.Upon discharge, all patients with anaphylaxis should be equipped with an epinephrine autoinjector and an anaphylaxis emergency action plan to manage initial treatment of recurrent episodes. Epinephrine should be kept at the bedside in the future. Once a patient with anaphylaxis has been stabilized, the home (or relevant site) should be thoroughly searched for the blood-engorged insect as soon as possible.If necessary, pest management professionals may be called upon to aid in the inspection process.Identification of the insect is important for diagnosis because reagents for skin testing and laboratory diagnosis are not available.Proper insect identification can be obtained from a local college or university entomology department or the extension service at participating land-grant universities nationwide. Patients should be given information about how to prevent future contact with Triatoma, including modifications of their homes, bedrooms, and surrounding environment.If kissing bugs are suspected to be present or found in the home, a pest management professional should be contacted. Specific immunotherapy to reduce an allergic patient's sensitivity to Triatoma is not commercially available.Thus, avoidance and education about early recognition and treatment of recurrent allergic reactions is critical.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

We queried TriNetX, a global research network, to identify patients with dual-positive IgG serology for Trypanosoma cruzi. We captured outcomes of interest for up to 5 years. We found 429 patients with evidence of dual-positive T. cruzi IgG out of 19,831 patients with an available test result from 31U.S. medical centers. The positive proportion for those tested was 2.2%, up to 4.6% among Hispanics. We found a prevalence of a positive Chagas serology of 0.02% among Hispanics. Cardiomyopathy risk reached an annual rate of 1.3% during the initial 5 years of follow-up among patients with the indeterminate form.

Genetic diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi infecting raccoons (Procyon lotor) in two metropolitan areas of southern Louisiana: implications for parasite transmission networks,"Majeau, A., E. Cloherty, A. Nikki Anderson, S. C. Straif-Bourgeois, E. Dumonteil, and C. Herrera",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=18910,2023,"Abstract Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, exists as an anthropozoonosis in Louisiana. Raccoons are an important reservoir, as they demonstrate high prevalence and maintain high parasitemia longer than other mammals. Given the complex nature of parasite transmission networks and importance of raccoons as reservoirs that move between sylvatic and domestic environments, detailing the genetic diversity of T. cruzi in raccoons is crucial to assess risk to human health. Using a next-generation sequencing approach targeting the mini-exon, parasite diversity was assessed in two metropolitan areas of Louisiana. Sequences were analysed along with those previously identified in other mammals and vectors to determine if any association exists between ecoregion and parasite diversity. Parasites were identified from discrete typing units (DTUs) TcI, TcII, TcIV, TcV, and TcVI. DTUs TcII, TcV, and TcVI are previously unreported in raccoons in the US. TcI was the most abundant DTU, comprising nearly 80% of all sequences. All but one raccoon harboured multiple haplotypes, some demonstrating mixed infections of different DTUs. Furthermore, there is significant association between DTU distribution and level III ecoregion in Louisiana. Finally, while certain sequences were distributed across multiple tissues, others appeared to have tissue-specific tropism. Taken together, these findings indicate that ongoing surveillance of T. cruzi in theunitedstates(US) should be undertaken across ecoregions to fully assess risk to human health.

Successful parasites, such as the causative agent of CD, Trypanosoma cruzi have adapted to specific hosts during their phylogenesis. In this work, we have assembled an interactive network of the complex relations that occur between molecules within T. cruzi. An expert curation strategy was combined with a text-mining approach to screen 10,234 full-length research articles and over 200,000 abstracts relevant to T. cruzi. We obtained a scale-free network consisting of 1055 nodes and 874 edges, and composed of 838 proteins, 43 genes, 20 complexes, 9 RNAs, 36 simple molecules, 81 phenotypes, and 37 known pharmaceuticals. Further, we deployed an automated docking pipeline to conduct large-scale docking studies involving several thousand drugs and potential targets to identify network-based binding propensities. These experiments have revealed that the existing FDA-approved drugs benznidazole (Bz) and nifurtimox (Nf) show comparatively high binding energies to the T. cruzi network proteins (e.g., PIF1 helicase-like protein, trans-sialidase), when compared with control datasets consisting of proteins from other pathogens. We envisage this work to be of value to those interested in finding new vaccines for CD, as well as drugs against the T. cruzi parasite.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Conventional tests are currently used with very good results but require time, laboratory infrastructure, and expertise. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are an alternative as the results are immediate and do not require specialized knowledge, making them suitable for epidemiologic studies and promising as a screening tool. Nevertheless, few studies conducted comparative evaluations of RDTs to validate the results and assess their performance. In this study, we analyzed four trades of rapid tests (OnSite Chagas Ab Combo Rapid Test-unitedstates, SD Bioline Chagas ABunitedstates, WL Check Chagas-Argentina, and TR Chagas Bio-Manguinhos- Brazil) using a panel of 190 samples, including sera from 111 infected individuals, most of whom had low T. cruzi antibody levels. An additional 59 samples from uninfected individuals and 20 sera from individuals with other diseases, mainly visceral leishmaniasis, were included. All tests were performed by three independent laboratories in a blinded manner. Results showed differences in sensitivity from 92.8 to 100%, specificity from 78.5 to 92.4%, and accuracy from 90.5 to 95.3% among the four assays. The results presented here show that all four RDTs have high overall diagnostic ability. However, WL Check Chagas and TR Chagas Bio-Manguinhos were considered most suitable for use in screening studies due to their high sensitivity combined with good performance. Although these two RDTs have high sensitivity, a positive result should be confirmed with other tests to confirm or rule out reactivity/ positivity, especially considering possible cross-reactivity with individuals with leishmaniasis or toxoplasmosis.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), it is one of six parasitic diseases in theunitedstatestargeted by the Centers for Disease Control as a public health problem in need of action. An estimated 300,000 people are infected with T. cruzi in theunitedstates(US). Although its morbidity, mortality and economic burden are high, awareness of Chagas disease is lacking among many healthcare providers in the US. The purpose of this analysis is to determine if the number of diagnostic tests performed at a community health center serving an at-risk population for Chagas disease increased after information sessions. A secondary aim was to determine if there was a difference by provider type, i.e., nurse practitioner vs. physician, or by specialty in the number of patients screened. Methodology/Principal findings We conducted a retrospective data analysis of the number of Chagas serology tests performed at a community health center before and after information sessions for clinicians. A time series analysis was conducted focusing on the Adult and Family Medicine Departments at East Boston Neighborhood Health Center (EBNHC). Across all departments there were 1,957 T. cruzi tests performed before the sessions vs. 2,623 after the sessions. Interrupted time series analysis across departments indicated that testing volume was stable over time prior to the sessions (pre-period slope = +4.1 per month; p = 0.12), followed by an immediate shift after the session (+51.6; p = 0.03), while testing volume remained stable over time after the session (post-period slope = -6.0 per month; p = 0.11).

National regulatory authorities, such as theunitedstatesFood and Drug Administration (FDA), play an essential role in this effort to ensure access to safe and effective medical products by working within a set of legal frameworks and regulatory functions. However, medical product development for NTDs remains neglected, as combating NTDs is not a viable commercial market for pharmaceutical companies. To spur research and development (R&D) of NTD products, the US government has authorized various programs and policies to engage pharmaceutical companies, many of which provide FDA with the legal authority to implement NTD programs and pathways. Thus, this review provides a clear overview of the various regulatory pathways and programs employed by the FDA to increase the availability of NTD drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. The review assesses the available information on various regulatory considerations and their impact on NTD product development as a first step in estimating the importance of such programs. Next, findings related to currently approved NTD products through these programs are discussed. Lastly, gaps in NTD R&D are identified and suggestions on how to address these are presented. The available data shows that while such incentive programs are factored into companies’ decisions to pursue NTD R&D, approved products for NTDs remains vastly insufficient. Most approved products that utilize these NTD regulatory pathways and programs are overwhelmingly for tuberculosis and malaria—both of which are not considered NTDs by the World Health Organization (WHO). Dedicated efforts are needed to facilitate and accelerate NTD product including employing multiple incentive programs, regular assessment of such programs, and leveraging on public–private partnerships.",,,,,,,,,,left_only
Exclusion of Horizontal and Vertical Transmission as Major Sources of Trypanosoma cruzi Infections in a Breeding Colony of Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta),"Kiehl, W. M., C. L. Hodo, G. L. Hamer, S.

This parasite is endemic to the southernunitedstateswhere outdoor-housed NHP at biomedical facilities are at risk of infection. In addition to the direct morbidity caused by T. cruzi, infected animals are of limited biomedical research use because infections can produce confounding pathophysiologic changes even in animals with no clinical disease. In part due to concerns for direct T. cruzi transmission between animals, infected NHP at some institutions have been culled, removed, or otherwise isolated from uninfected animal populations. However, data that document horizontal or vertical transmission in captive NHP in theunitedstatesare not available. To evaluate the potential for inter-animal transmission and to identify environmental factors that affect the distribution of new infections in NHPs, we conducted a retrospective epidemiologic study of a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) breeding colony in south Texas. We used archived biologic samples and husbandry records to identify the time and location of macaque seroconversion. These data were used to perform a spatial analysis of how geographic location and animal associations affected the spread of disease and to infer the importance of horizontal or vertical routes of transmission. The majority of T. cruzi infections were spatially clustered, suggesting that environmental factors promoted vector exposure in various areas of the facility. Although we cannot not rule out horizontal transmission, our data suggest that horizontal transmission was not a critical route for spread for the disease. Vertical transmission was not a contributing factor in this colony. In conclusion, our findings suggest that local triatome vectors were the major source of T. cruzi infections in captive macaques in our colony. Therefore, limiting contact with vectors, rather than segregation of infected macaques, is a key strategy for disease prevention at institutions that house macaques outdoors in the southernunitedstates.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

T. cruzi is transmitted to humans by the bite of triatomine vectors; both the parasite and disease are endemic in Latin America and theunitedstates. In the last decades, population migration has changed the classic epidemiology of T. cruzi, contributing to its global spread to traditionally nonendemic countries. Screening is recommended for Latin American populations residing in non-endemic countries. Methods The present study analyzes the epidemiological characteristics of 2,820 Latin American individuals who attended the International Health Service (IHS) of the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona between 2002 and 2019. The initial assessment of organ damage among positive cases of T. cruzi infection was analyzed, including the results of electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, barium enema and esophagogram. Results Among all the screened individuals attending the clinic, 2,441 (86.6%) were born in Bolivia and 1,993 (70.7%) were female. Of individuals, 1,517 (81.5%) reported previous exposure to the vector, which is a strong risk factor associated with T. cruzi infection; 1,382 individuals were positive for T. cruzi infection. The first evaluation of individuals with confirmed T. cruzi infection, showed 148 (17.1%) individuals with Chagasic cardiomyopathy, the main diagnostic method being an ECG and the right bundle branch block (RBBB) for the most frequent disorder; 16 (10.8%) individuals had a normal ECG and were diagnosed of Chagasic cardiomyopathy by echocardiogram. Conclusions We still observe many Latin American individuals who were at risk of T. cruzi infection in highly endemic areas in their countries of origin, and who have not been previously tested for T. cruzi infection. In fact, even in Spain, a country with one of the highest proportion of diagnosis of Latin American populations, T. cruzi infection remains underdiagnosed. The screening of Latin American populations presenting with a similar profile as reported here should be promoted. ECG is considered necessary to assess Chagasic cardiomyopathy in positive individuals, but echocardiograms should also be considered as a diagnostic approach given that it can detect cardiac abnormalities when the ECG is normal.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

This study aimed to identify the suite of mammalian reservoirs of T. cruzi in Florida. We also compared infection prevalence in raccoon populations sampled from within and outside of the estimated distribution of the common T. cruzi vector in Florida to gain insight into how the arthropod vector distribution impacts the distribution of infected reservoirs in the state. Finally, to investigate the impact of peridomestic landscapes on parasite prevalence, we compared the prevalence of T. cruzi-infected raccoons and opossums across five paired peridomestic and sylvatic sites.

It is a progressive myocarditis with features of biventricular dysfunction, ventricular arrhythmias and thromboembolic complications. Data suggests that patients with acute Chagas disease can proceed to chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy without an intervening indeterminate phase. The objective of this paper is to describe a case where acute chagas disease progressed to chagas cardiomyopathy over 4 months in a young woman who visited the Bahamas, which has not been reported before. Case: Our patient is a 25-year-old woman who presented with shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance over the past 3 months. She visited the Bahamas 4 months ago during which she had multiple insect bites. Her vital signs were normal temperature, blood pressure of 153/101mmHg, HR of 97 and O2 saturation 100% on RA. Physical exam was positive for crackles and bilateral lower extremity edema. pro-BNP 459. Other labs sent included Trypanosoma cruzi IgG antibodies, HIV, SPEP.

She was admitted to the cardiology service for expedited work-up and close monitoring. Decision-making: An transthoracic echocardiogram was unremarkable. The patient underwent left heart catheterization to rule out “silent” coronary artery disease as etiology of conduction disturbances, which demonstrated patent coronary arteries. Prior to a pacemaker referral, a cardiac MRI was obtained as sarcoidosis and other infiltrative pathologies were on the differential. The MRI demonstrated late gadolinium enhancement consistent with epicardial scar in the inferiorlateral wall of the left ventricle. One of the treating physicians recognized the pattern as being characteristic of Chagas disease in the literature, and sent for the antibody test, which came back positive. Conclusion: Chagas disease is traditionally not thought to be present in the Mid-Atlantic region of theunitedstates, unless the patient has clear history of travel from an endemic region. However, Chagas disease should be on the differential for patients suspected of having infiltrative cardiac disease given its increased incidence in theunitedstates.",,,,,,,,,,left_only
Sensitivity analysis for causality in observational studies for regulatory science,"Díaz, I., H. Lee, E. Kiciman, E. J. Schenck, M. Akacha, D. Follman and D. Ghosh.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20745,2023,"Objective: TheunitedstatesCongress passed the 21st Century Cures Act mandating the development of Food and Drug Administration guidance on regulatory use of real-world evidence. The Forum on the Integration of Observational and Randomized Data conducted a meeting with various stakeholder groups to build consensus around best practices for the use of real-world data (RWD) to support regulatory science. Our companion paper describes in detail the context and discussion of the meeting, which includes a recommendation to use a causal roadmap for study designs using RWD. This article discusses one step of the roadmap: the specification of a sensitivity analysis for testing robustness to violations of causal model assumptions. Methods: We present an example of a sensitivity analysis from a RWD study on the effectiveness of Nifurtimox in treating Chagas disease, and an overview of various methods, emphasizing practical considerations on their use for regulatory purposes. Results: Sensitivity analyses must be accompanied by careful design of other aspects of the causal roadmap. Their prespecification is crucial to avoid wrong conclusions due to researcher degrees of freedom. Sensitivity analysis methods require auxiliary information to produce meaningful conclusions; it is important that they have at least two properties: the validity of the conclusions does not rely on unverifiable assumptions, and the auxiliary information required by the method is learnable from the corpus of current scientific knowledge. Conclusions: Prespecified and assumption-lean sensitivity analyses are a crucial tool that can strengthen the validity and trustworthiness of effectiveness conclusions for regulatory science.",,,,,,,,,,left_only
Ecological interactions of Triatoma sanguisuga (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) and risk for human infection with Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in Illinois and Louisiana,"Dumonteil, E., W. Tu, F. A. Jiménez and C. Herrera.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20775,2024,"Triatoma sanguisuga (Leconte) is one of the most widely distributed kissing bugs in theunitedstates, associated with an extensive zoonotic circulation of Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, in a large part of the country. However, the actual risk for human infection in theunitedstatesis poorly understood. Here, we further assessed the ecology of T. sanguisuga bugs collected in residents houses in Illinois and Louisiana, using a metagenomic approach to identify their blood-feeding sources, T. cruzi parasites and gut microbiota. Blood meal analysis revealed feeding on domestic animals (dogs, cats, pigs, goats, and turkeys), synanthropic species (raccoons, opossums, and squirrels), as well as the more sylvatic white-tail deer. Human blood was identified in 11/14 (78%) of bugs, highlighting a frequent vector-human contact. The infection rate with T. cruzi was 53% (8/15), and most infected bugs (6/8) had fed on humans. A total of 41 bacterial families were identified, with significant differences in microbiota alpha and beta diversity between bugs from Louisiana and Illinois. However, predicted metabolic functions remained highly conserved, suggesting important constraints to fulfill their role in bug biology. These results confirmed a significant risk for vector-borne transmission of T. cruzi to humans in Louisiana and Illinois, which warrants more active screening for human infections. Also, while there is broad plasticity in the bacterial composition of T. sanguisuga microbiota, there are strong constraints to preserve metabolic profile and function, making it a good target for novel vector control strategies.",,,,,,,,,,left_only
In vitro diagnostic methods of Chagas disease in the clinical laboratory: a scoping review,"Ascanio, L. C., S. Carroll, A. Paniz-Mondolfi and J. D. Ramírez.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20956,2024,"Background: Chagas disease (CD), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is a global health concern with expanding geographical reach. Despite improved and accessible test methods, diagnosing CD in its various phases remains complex. The existence of clinical scenarios, including immunosuppressed patients, transplant-related CD reactivation, transfusion-associated cases, and orally transmitted acute infections, adds to the diagnostic challenge. No singular gold standard test exists for all phases, and recommendations from PAHO and the CDC advocate for the use of two serological methods for chronic CD diagnosis, while molecular methods or direct parasite detection are suggested for the acute phase. Given the complexity in the diagnostic landscape of CD, the goal of this scoping review is to characterize available diagnostic tests for CD in the clinical laboratory. Methods: A literature search in PubMed was conducted on studies related to In vitro diagnosis (IVD) in humans published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese language as of 28 August 2023, and extended backward with no predefined time frame. Studies underwent title and abstract screening, followed by full-text review. Studies included were classified based on the diagnostic method used. Test methods were grouped as serological, molecular, and other methods. Performance, availability, and regulatory status were also characterized. Results: Out of 85 studies included in the final review, 115 different tests were identified. These tests comprised 89 serological test types, 21 molecular test types, and 5 other test methods. Predominant serological tests included ELISA (38 studies, 44.70%), Rapid tests (19 studies, 22.35%), and chemiluminescence (10 studies, 11.76%). Among molecular tests, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays were notable. Twenty-eight tests were approved globally for IVD or donor testing, all being serological methods. Molecular assays lacked approval for IVD in theunitedstates, with only European and Colombian regulatory acceptance. Discussion and conclusion: Serological tests, specifically ELISAs, remain the most used and commercially available diagnostic methods. This makes sense considering that most Chagas disease diagnoses occur in the chronic phase and that the WHO gold standard relies on 2 serological tests to establish the diagnosis of chronic Chagas. ELISAs are feasible and relatively low-cost, with good performance with sensitivities ranging between 77.4% and 100%, and with specificities ranging between 84.2% and 100%. Molecular methods allow the detection of specific variants but rely on the parasites presence, which limits their utility to parasitemia levels. Depending on the PCR method and the phase of the disease, the sensitivity ranged from 58.88 to 100% while the mean specificity ranged from 68.8% to 100%. Despite their performance, molecular testing remains mostly unavailable for IVD use. Only 3 molecular tests are approved for IVD, which are available only in Europe. Six commercial serological assays approved by the FDA are available for blood and organ donor screening. Currently, there are no guidelines for testing CD oral outbreaks. Although more evidence is needed on how testing methods should be used in special clinical scenarios, a comprehensive approach of clinical assessment and diagnostics tests, including not IVD methods, is required for an accurate CD diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,,left_only
Correlation of TcII discrete typing units with severe chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy in patients from various Brazilian geographic regions,"Tavares de Oliveira, M., C. A. Fuzo, M. C. da Silva, E. A. Donadi, J. Santana da Silva, H. Turin Moreira, A. Schmidt and J. A. Marin-Neto.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=19123,2022,"Background Chagas disease (ChD) is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. The genetic structure of the species is divided into seven distinct genetic groups, TcI to TcVI, and Tcbat, which have shown differences in terms of geographic distribution, biological properties, and susceptibility to drugs. However, the association between genetic variability and clinical forms of ChD has not yet been fully elucidated. The predominance of TcII and TcVI discrete typing units (DTUs) (genetic groups) is known to occur in several Brazilian regions and is associated with both the domestic and the wild cycles of ChD. Thus, this study aimed to verify the genotypes of the parasites present in 330 patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) from different Brazilianstatesattended at the Clinical Hospital of the Ribeirão Preto Medical School and to assess the existence of a correlation between the clinical forms with the main cardiovascular risk factors and the genetics of the parasite. Methodology Principal findings All patients with CCC were clinically evaluated through anamnesis, physical examination, biochemical tests, 12-lead electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and chest X-ray. Peripheral blood (5 mL) was collected in guanidine/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid from each patient for DNA extraction and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Chagas disease and genotyping of the parasite in the 7 DTUs. Parasite genotyping was performed using conventional multilocus PCR. Samples of only 175 patients were positive after amplification of the specific genes contained in the T. cruzi genotyping criteria. TcII (64/175), TcVI (9/175), and TcI (3/175) DTUs were predominant, followed by TcII/TcV/TcVI (74/175), and TcII/TcVI (23/ 175). The TcIII and TcIV DTU´s was detected in only one sample of CCC patients. Conclusions/Significance Our data corroborate previous findings, indicating the predominance of the TcII genotype in patients with CCC of Brazilian origin. Moreover, this study pioneered disclosing a direct correlation between the TcII DTU and severe CCC.",,,,,,,,,,left_only
Differentiating Trypanosoma cruzi in a Host Mammalian Cell Imaged in Aqueous Liquid by Atmospheric Scanning Electron Microscopy,"Takagi, Y., M. Sato, M. Naya and C. Sato.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=15701,2022,"Atmospheric Scanning Electron Microscopy (ASEM) is a powerful tool to observe a wet specimen at high resolution under atmospheric pressure. Here, we visualized a protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi over the course of its infection cycle in the host mammalian cell. This is the first observation of intracellular parasite using a liquidphase EM. Unlike regular SEM, aldehyde-fixed cell body of T. cruzi appears translucent, allowing the visualization of internal structures such as kinetoplast of trypomastigote and nucleus of amastigote. Plasma membrane of the host mammalian cell also appears translucent, which enabled direct observation of differentiating intracellular parasites and dynamic change of host cellular structures in their near-naturalstates. Various water-rich structures including micro- and macro- vesicles were visualized around T. cruzi. In addition, Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy exploiting open sample dish of ASEM allowed identification of parasite nucleus and transfected fluorescence-labeled parasites soon after internalization, while location of this morphological intermediate was otherwise obscure. Successful visualization of the differentiation of T. cruzi within the host cell demonstrated here opens up the possibility of using ASEM for observation of variety of intracellular parasites.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Barbosa Marcon.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=19158,2023,"In Brazil, blood donation is regulated by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and allstatesfollow the same protocol for clinical and laboratory screening. Brazil is an endemic country for Chagas disease (CD), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, and for leishmaniasis, caused by a species of Leishmania spp. Screening for leishmaniosis is not routinely performed by blood banks. Given the antigenic similarity between T. cruzi and Leishmania spp., cross-reactions in serological tests can occur, and inconclusive results for CD have been found. The objective of this study was to apply molecular techniques, e.g., nPCR, PCR, and qPCR, to clarify cases of blood donation candidates with non-negative serology for CD and to analyze the difference between the melting temperature during real-time PCR using SYBR Green. Thirty-seven cases that showed non-negative results for CD using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) tests from blood banks in Campo Grande, MS, and Campinas, SP, were analyzed. In the serum samples, 35 samples were evaluated by ELISA, and 24.3% (9/35) showed positive results for CD. nPCR was able to detect 12 positive results in 35 samples (34.28%). qPCR for T. cruzi was quantifiable in the samples that showed a value 0.002 par eq/mL (parasite equivalents per milliliter), and in 35 samples, 11 (31.42%) were positive. Of all evaluated samples using the described tests (CMIA, ELISA, nPCR, and qPCR), 18 (48.6%) were positive for CD. For MCA by qPCR, the melting temperature was 82.06 C  0.46 for T. cruzi and 81.9 C  0.24 for Leishmania infantum. The Mann–Whitney test showed a significant value of p < 0.0001. However, the differentiation between T. cruzi and L. infantum could not be considered due to temperature overlap. For leishmaniasis, of the 35 samples with non-negative serology for CD tested by the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), only one sample (2.85%) was positive (1:80). The PCR for Leishmania spp. was performed on 36 blood samples from donation candidates, and all were negative. qPCR for L. infantum showed 37 negative results for the 37 analyzed samples. The data presented here show the importance of performing two different tests in CD screening at blood banks. Molecular tests should be used for confirmation, thereby improving the blood donation system.",,,,,,,,,,left_only
Bayesian Spatiotemporal Projection of Chagas Disease Incidence in Brazil,"Roubenoff, E.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=18818,2023,"Chagas Disease is a parasitic infection caused by the T. Cruzi parasite endemic to Central and South America and transmitted through contact with Triatomine insects, commonly known as “kissing bugs.” Although the symptoms of Acute Chagas Disease (ACD) are nonspecific, untreated chronic infection can lead to heart disease, enlarged esophagus and colon, and stroke. Chagas disease has become increasingly rare owing to a series of public health interventions, including insect eradication campaigns in Brazil through the 1980’s that considerably reduced the number of new acute cases. However, hundreds of new acute cases still are diagnosed annually, primarily in thestatesof Pará, Amapá, and Acre. Moreover, the population in areas of high Chagas endemicity are changing: many areas are growing and becoming increasingly urban, whereas others are decreasing in population. We estimate the Incidence Rate (IR) for Acute Chagas disease over the period 2001-2019 in Brazil at the municipal level and investigate the variation of these rates with climatic factors. These estimates are used to project forward incidence of Acute Chagas Disease over the following decade 2020-2029. Modeling ACD presents numerous methodological challenges since incidence is rare, with extreme overdispersion of zero-case counts, and vectors exhibit a highly spatially- and temporally-clustered pattern. We use a spatially- and temporally-autoregressive small-area smoothing models to estimate the true latent risk in developing Acute Chagas Disease. The Bayesian model presented here involves spatio-temporal smoothing via a Zero-Inflated (Lambert 1992), Knorr-Held (2000)-Type spatio-temporal model with a BYM2 (Morris, 2019) spatial convolution to predict smoothed incidence rates of Chagas disease. As well, we include estimates of Brazil’s growing population and projected bioclimate to evaluate how climate and population change may affect ACD rates. We estimate that cases will continue to increase in the absence of control efforts, primarily driven by a growing peri-urban population in regions of Chagas endemicity.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Method This is a mixed ecological study with spatial and temporal trends, based on national population data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health - hospital admissions (HA) and death certificates (DC). Records with CD as a primary or secondary cause of death in HA and/or as an underlying or associated cause of death in DC were evaluated. Temporal trends were analysed by Joinpoint regression and the spatial distribution of age- and gender-adjusted rates, spatial moving averages, and standardized morbidity ratios. Results There was a total of 4,376 HAs due to CD that resulted in death and 122,275 deaths from CD. The Southeast region recorded the highest proportions and rates of HAs resulting in death (63.9%, n = 2,796; 0.17/100,000 inhabitants), and overall deaths from CD (51.0%, n = 62,308; 3.79/100,000 inhabitants). The highest risk of CD-related death was found in males (Relative risk RR 1.27) and Afro-Brazilians (RR 1.63). There was an increase in hospital mortality from CD (Average Annual Percent Change AAPC 7.5, 95% Confidence Interval CI 5.3 to 9.9), and stability in the North, Northeast and Southeast regions. For CD-related mortality, a decrease was observed in the country (AAPC . 0.7%, 95%CI -0.9 to -0.5), with an increase in the Northeast region (AAPC 1.1%, 95%CI 0.6 to 1.6). Municipalities with a very high Brazilian Deprivation Index tended to show increased mortality (AAPC 2.1%, 95%CI 1.6 to 2.7), while the others showed a decrease. Conclusion Hospital case fatality and specific mortality due to CD are a relevant public health problem in Brazil. Differences related to gender, ethnicity, and social vulnerability reinforce the need for comprehensive care, and to ensure equity in access to health in the country. Municipalities,states, and regions with indicators that reveal higher morbidity and mortality need to be prioritized.",,,,,,,,,,left_only
European priority review vouchers for neglected disease product development,"Ridley , D. B., A. M. Lasanta, F. S. Jones and S. K. Ridley.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=18822,2024,"Introduction Neglected diseases are a significant global health challenge. Encouraging the development of therapeutics and vaccines for these diseases would address an important unmet medical need. We propose a priority review voucher programme for the European Union (EU). The developer of a drug or vaccine for a neglected disease would receive a voucher for accelerated assessment of a different product at the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Methods This study uses retrospective observational data to estimate the potential commercial value of the proposed voucher programme using a five-step approach: (1) estimating the time saved in the EMA accelerated regulatory review; (2) gauging time reductions in accelerated pricing and reimbursement decisions by EU memberstates; (3) selecting 10 high-revenue products launched between 2015 and 2020 representing typical voucher users; (4) analysing IQVIA MIDAS sales data for the selected products and (5) calculating the net present value (NPV) of the voucher based on the 10 products. Results The accelerated EMA review would reduce regulatory time by an average of 182 days. Additionally, products could save more than a year in many memberstatesthrough an expedited 120-day pricing and reimbursement review. The estimated NPV of regulatory acceleration by two quarters would be €100 million. In addition, if France, Italy and Spain reviewed pricing and reimbursement in only 120 days, then the value would double. Conclusion An EU voucher estimated at more than 100 million, coupled with a USS100 million counterpart, offers a meaningful incentive for novel product development. However, the voucher programme should be part of a comprehensive strategy for tackling neglected diseases, rather than a standalone solution.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Here, we studied the role of host competence, geographic area provenance, and diversity of vector-host interactions as drivers of wild mammal infection risk to Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease. We performed a systematic sampling of wild mammals in 11statesof Mexico, from 2017 to 2018. We tested the positivity of T. cruzi with the Tc24 marker in tissues samples for 61 wild mammal species (524 specimens sampled). 26 mammal species were positive for T. cruzi, of which 11 are new hosts recorded in Mexico 75 specimens were positive and 449 were negative for T. cruzi infection, yielding an overall prevalence of 14.3%. The standardized infection risk of T. cruzi of our examined specimens was similar, no matter the host species or their geographic origins. Additionally, we used published data of mammal positives for T. cruzi to complement records of T. cruzi infection in wild mammals and inferred a trophic network of Triatoma spp. (vectors) and wild mammal species in Mexico, using spatial data-mining modelling. Infection with T. cruzi was not homogeneously distributed in the inferred trophic network. This information allowed us to develop a predictive model for T. cruzi infection risk for wild mammals in Mexico, considering risk as a function of the diversity of vector-host spatial associations in a large-scale geographic context, finding that the addition of competent vectors to a multi-host parasite system amplifies host infection risk. The diversity of vector-host interactions per se constitutes a relevant driver of infection risk because hosts and vectors are not isolated from each other.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Pereira Nunes.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=20139,2022,"Despite substantial progress toward its control, Chagas disease continues to be a major public health problem in Latin America and has become a global health concern. The disease affects approximately 6 million people, of whom 20–40% will develop cardiomyopathy over the years after the initial Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Chagas cardiomyopathy is the most serious and frequent manifestation of Chagas disease. Clinical manifestations vary widely according to the severity of myocardial dysfunction, ranging from asymptomatic to severe forms, including dilated cardiomyopathy with heart failure, arrhythmias, thromboembolism events, and sudden death. Chagas disease is a risk factor for stroke regardless of the severity of cardiomyopathy, which is a leading cause of chronic disability. Classically, stroke etiology in patients with Chagas disease is thought to be cardioembolic and related to apical aneurysm, mural thrombus, and atrial arrhythmias. Although most strokes are thromboembolic, other etiologies have been observed. Small vessel disease, atherosclerosis, and cryptogenic diseases have been reported in patients with Chagas disease and stroke. The potential mechanisms involved in non-embolic strokes include the presence of associated risk factors, pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic diseasestates, and endothelial dysfunction. However, the contribution of each mechanism to stroke in Chagas disease remains unclear.

Approximately 50–70% of individuals in the chronic phase of CD present the indeterminate form, characterized by parasitological and/or serological evidence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, but without clinical signs and symptoms. Subclinical abnormalities have been reported in indeterminate form of CD, including pro-inflammatorystatesand alterations in cardiac function, biomarkers and autonomic modulation. Moreover, individuals with CD are usually impacted on their personal and professional life, making social insertion difficult and impacting their mental health and quality of life (QoL). Physical exercise has been acknowledged as an important strategy to prevent and control numerous chronic-degenerative diseases, but unexplored in individuals with the indeterminate form of CD. The PEDI-CHAGAS study (which stands for “Home-Based Exercise Program in the Indeterminate Form of Chagas Disease” in Portuguese) aims to evaluate the effects of a home-based exercise program on physical and mental health outcomes in individuals with indeterminate form of CD. Methods and design: The PEDI-CHAGAS is a two-arm (exercise and control) phase 3 superiority randomized clinical trial including patients with indeterminate form of CD. The exclusion criteria are <18 years old, evidence of non-Chagasic cardiomyopathy, musculoskeletal or cognitive limitations that preclude the realization of exercise protocol, clinical contraindication for regular exercise, and regular physical exercise (1 per week). Participants will be assessed at baseline, and after three and 6 months of followup. The primary outcome will be QoL. Secondary outcomes will include blood pressure, physical fitness components, nutritional status, fatigability, autonomic modulation, cardiac morphology and function, low back pain, depression and anxiety, stress, sleep quality, medication use and adherence, and biochemical, inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers. Participants in the intervention group will undergo a home-based exercise program whilst those in the control group will receive only general information regarding the benefits of physical activity. Both groups will receive the same general nutritional counseling consisting of general orientations about healthy diets. Conclusion: The findings from the present study may support public health intervention strategies to improve physical and mental health parameters to be implemented more effectively in this population.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

There was an increase in hospital mortality from CD (Average Annual Percent Change [AAPC] 7.5, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 5.3 to 9.9), and stability in the North, Northeast and Southeast regions. For CD-related mortality, a decrease was observed in the country (AAPC - 0.7%, 95%CI -0.9 to -0.5), with an increase in the Northeast region (AAPC 1.1%, 95%CI 0.6 to 1.6). Municipalities with a very high Brazilian Deprivation Index tended to show increased mortality (AAPC 2.1%, 95%CI 1.6 to 2.7), while the others showed a decrease. Conclusion Hospital case fatality and specific mortality due to CD are a relevant public health problem in Brazil. Differences related to gender, ethnicity, and social vulnerability reinforce the need for comprehensive care, and to ensure equity in access to health in the country. Municipalities,states, and regions with indicators that reveal higher morbidity and mortality need to be prioritized.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Since the pacemaker or cardioverter-defibrillator has become a highly relevant agent for treating these arrhythmias and Brazil has endemic areas for this infectious disease, the need to investigate its correlations becomes undeniable. This work aims to evaluate the prevalence and clinicalepidemiological profile of CD in individuals needing artificial cardiac stimulation in a tertiary service. Methods: Crosssectional observation study with 65 patients undergoing the device implantation procedure at Hospital do Coração de Natal [Heart Hospital from Natal (RN - Brazil)], from July 13/2022 to March 31/2023. The variables gender, age, origin, clinical conditions, knowledge about Triatomineus, and Anti-Trypanosoma Cruzi IgG antibody results were used to characterize the studied population. Data were collected using a specific form previously authorized by the Ethics Committee and with informed consent. Results: It was observed that 56% of those interviewed were elderly, and 18% were under 60 years of age. 69% come from the east zone of Rio Grande do Norte (RN), followed by users from the central region (12%), rural (12%) and western (6%) of Rio Grande do Norte (RN), with only 1% from otherstatesin Brazil. Regarding the associated pathologies of this group of patients, 64.6% of those interviewed were hypertensive (SAH), 27.6% are or were smokers and 24.6% had Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Regarding the diagnosis, 86% was demonstrated by electrocardiogram, in which 50.7% presented total atrioventricular block (CAVB). In addition, 05 patients (7.7%) had reactive anti-Trypanosoma Cruzi IgG antibodies, 02 of which were under 60 years of age. 02 patients came from the west zone of Rio Grande do Norte, 02 from the east zone and 01 from the central zone of RN. From this perspective, 33.8% of those interviewed stated that they had already had contact with this insect, while 66.2 had not. Conclusion: The clinical-epidemiological profile was men, elderly, from all over RN, smokers and /or people with DM and or SAH, with an electrocardiographic diagnosis of atrioventricular blocks, predominantly AVB. Furthermore, a low prevalence of Chagas disease was observed in these patients, as well as little self-declared contact with the triatomine. However, we live in an endemic area, and considering this user profile, it is crucial that health services act in the screening and provisional intervention process, avoiding worsening.

We also estimated the potential impact of misclassification on the number of deaths attributed to ChD. Study design: Population-based descriptive study. Methods: We used the Mortality Information System (SIM; in Portuguese) data before and after routine GC investigation in 2015e2019 to evaluate ChD deaths detected among them.We identified priority GCs, which contributed more than 0.1 % to the percentage of total ChD deaths registered. Spearman's correlation was used to evaluate the association between the reclassification of priority GCs and ChD prevalence. Then, we applied the GC correction factors to estimate the number of deaths attributed to ChD. Results: 22,154 deaths were reported as ChD in the study period. Among them, 1004 deaths originally listed as priority GCs were deaths reclassified to ChD after an investigation in the SIM final database. Unspecific cardiomyopathy (10.2 %), unspecific heart diseases (4.7 %), and heart failure (2.8 %) were GCs with the highest proportions of reclassification to ChD in Brazil. Higher ChD prevalence at the state level was associated with a higher proportion of GC deaths reclassified as ChD. When applying correction factors identified after investigation, we estimated an increase of 26.4 % in registered ChD deaths, mostly instateswith higher endemicity. Conclusions: GCs might conceal deaths due to ChD, particularly in Brazil'sstateswith higher endemicity. The approach suggested in this study may offer an alternative method for estimating ChD-related deaths in endemic countries.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

As one of the World Health Organization Neglected Tropical Diseases undoubtedly calls for comprehensive healthcare, transcending a restricted biomedical approach. After more than a century since their discovery, in 1909, people affected by CD are still frequently marginalised and/or neglected. The aim of this article is to tell the story of their activism, highlighting key historical experiences and successful initiatives, from 1909 to 2019. The first association was created in 1987, in the city of Recife, Brazil. So far, thirty associations have been reported on five continents. They were created as independent non-profit civil society organisations and run democratically by affected people. Among the common associations’ objectives, we notably find: increase the visibility of the affected; make their voice heard; build bridges between patients, health system professionals, public health officials, policy makers and the academic and scientific communities. The International Federation of Associations of People Affected by CD - FINDECHAGAS, created in 2010 with the input of the Americas, Europe and the Western Pacific, counts as one of the main responses to the globalisation of CD. Despite all the obstacles and difficulties encountered, the Federation has thrived, grown, and matured. As a result of this mobilisation along with the support of many national and international partners, in May 2019 the 72nd World Health Assembly decided to establish World Chagas Disease Day, on 14 April.

Previous research identified complementarity and embeddedness as two essential features of successful coproduction. However, most of the literature on coproduction studies users and providers who share the same language and culture, even if power asymmetries are high. We combine the literatures on non-state social welfare provision and on coproduction to analyze a collaboration betweenstatesand non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in multicultural and multilingual contexts. In such contexts, we argue, embeddedness requires not only language interpreters but also intercultural policies and training, without which the benefits of coproduction are lost in translation. Our study is based on a recent collaboration between thestatesof Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay and two health care NGOs that provide prenatal care to women in the Gran Chaco. In this region, a large portion of the population is Indigenous and maternal and infant mortality are high. Based on participant observation and in-depth interviews, combined with observational data, we analyze the experiences of public health care providers and NGO doctors involved in the intervention. We evaluate if there is complementarity between the state and the NGOs regarding access to preventive health care, diagnosis and treatment, and human resources in the health sector. Finally, we analyze whether state or NGO actors are embedded in local civil society or Indigenous communities. We find that this medical intervention significantly improves access to and delivery of health care to pregnant women, and promotes attention to neglected diseases such as Chagas.

Falcón-Lezama, R. Tapia-Conyer and C. R. Stephens.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=19302,2023,"(1) Background: Chagas disease is the main neglected tropical disease in America. It is estimated that around 6 million people are currently infected with the parasite in Latin America, and 25 million live in endemic areas with active transmission. The disease causes an estimated economic loss of USD 24 billion dollars annually, with a loss of 75,200 working years per year of life; it is responsible for around ~12,000 deaths annually. Although Mexico is an endemic country that recorded 10,186 new cases of Chagas disease during the period of 1990–2017, few studies have evaluated the genetic diversity of genes that could be involved in the prophylaxis and/or diagnosis of the parasite. One of the possible candidates proposed as a vaccine target is the 24 kDa trypomastigote excretory–secretory protein, Tc24, whose protection is linked to the stimulation of T. cruzi-specific CD8+ immune responses. (2) Methods: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the fine-scale genetic diversity and structure of Tc24 in T. cruzi isolates from Mexico, and to compare them with other populations reported in the Americas with the aim to reconsider the potential role of Tc24 as a key candidate for the prophylaxis and improvement of the diagnosis of Chagas disease in Mexico. (3) Results: Of the 25 Mexican isolates analysed, 48% (12) were recovered from humans and 24% (6) recovered from Triatoma barberi and Triatoma dimidiata. Phylogenetic inferences revealed a polytomy in the T. cruzi clade with two defined subgroups, one formed by all sequences of the DTU I and the other formed by DTU II–VI; both subgroups had high branch support. Genetic population analysis detected a single (monomorphic) haplotype of TcI throughout the entire distribution across both Mexico and South America. This information was supported by Nei’s pairwise distances, where the sequences of TcI showed no genetic differences. (4) Conclusions: Given that both previous studies and the findings of the present work confirmed that TcI is the only genotype detected from human isolates obtained from variousstatesof Mexico, and that there is no significant genetic variability in any of them, it is possible to propose the development of in silico strategies for the production of antigens that optimise the diagnosis of Chagas disease, such as quantitative ELISA methods that use this region of Tc24.",,,,,,,,,,left_only

Toledo.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=16648,2022,"Background Rhodnius robustus and Rhodnius pictipes are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (CD), that are found in the Brazilian Amazon region. Susceptibility to infection and vector competence depend on the parasite-vector relationship. Our objective was to evaluate the interaction between T. cruzi and these two triatomine vectors in pure and mixed experimental infections of T. cruzi strains from the same or different geographic regions.  Methods Fifth-instar nymphs of R. robustus and R. pictipes were fed on mice infected with four T. cruzi strains, namely genotypes TcIAM, TcIMG, TcIIPR, and TcIVAM, respectively, from the Brazilianstatesof Amazonas, Minas Gerais and Paraná. Over a period of 120 days, excreta were examined every 20 days to assess vector competence, and intestinal contents (IC) were examined every 30 days to determine susceptibility to infection.  Results The highest positive rate in the fresh examination (%+FE, 30.0%), the highest number of parasitic forms (PF, n = 1969) and the highest metacyclogenesis rate (%MC, 53.8%) in the excreta were recorded for R. robustus/TcIVAM. Examination of the IC of R. pictipes revealed a higher number of PF in infections with TcIAM (22,680 PF) and TcIIPR (19,845 PF) alone or in association (17,145 PF), as well as a %+FE of 75.0% with TcII, in comparison with the other genotypes. The highest %MC (100%) was recorded for the mixed infections of TcIAM with TcIIPR or TcIVAM in the IC of R. pictipes.  Conclusions Overall, both species were found to be susceptible to the T. cruzi strains studied. Rhodnius robustus showed vector competence for genotypes TcIVAM and TcIAM+TcIVAM and R. pictipes for TcIAM+TcIVAM and TcIAM+TcIIPR; there was elimination of infective forms as early as at 20 days. Our results suggest that both the genetics of the parasite and its geographic origin influence the susceptibility to infection and vector competence, alone or in association.",,,,,,,,,,left_only
"Triatoma costalimai, a neglected vector of Trypanosoma cruzi in the Cerrado savannas of South America: A comprehensive review","Lima de Miranda, V., R. Gurgel-Goncalves, R. C. Moreira de Souza and F. Abad-Franch.",https://bibtri.cepave.edu.ar/download.php?id=18645,2022,"Triatoma costalimai is a little-known triatomine-bug species whose role as a vector of Chagas disease remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive review of the literature and assessed the evidence base from a public-health perspective. We found 89 individual documents/resources with information about T. costalimai. DNA-sequence and cytogenetic data indicate that T. costalimai belongs, together with T. jatai, in a distinct clade within the ‘pseudomaculata group’ of South American Triatoma. Triatoma costalimai is probably a narrow endemic of the Cerrado on the upper Tocantins River Basin and associated ranges/plateaus; there, the species thrives in the sandstone/limestone outcrops typical of the “Cerrado rupestre” (rocky-soil savanna) and “mata seca decídua calcária” (limestone-soil dry forest) phytophysiognomies. Wild T. costalimai appear to feed on whatever vertebrates are available in rocky outcrops, with lizards and rodents being most common. There is persuasive evidence that house invasion/infestation by T. costalimai has increased in frequency since the 1990s. The bugs often carry Trypanosoma cruzi, often defecate while feeding, have high fecundity/fertility, and, under overtly favorable conditions, can produce two generations per year. Current knowledge suggests that T. costalimai can transmit human Chagas disease in the upper Tocantins Basin; control-surveillance systems should ‘tag’ the species as a potentially important local vector in thestatesof Goiás and Tocantins, Brazil. Further research is needed to clarify (i) the drivers and dynamics of house invasion, infestation, and reinfestation by T. costalimai and (ii) the genetic structuring and vector capacity of the species, including its wild and non-wild populations.",,,,,,,,,,left_only
