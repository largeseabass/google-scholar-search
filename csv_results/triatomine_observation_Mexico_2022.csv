New records of Triatoma huehuetenanguensis in an urban area of Southwest Mexico,"The recently described Triatoma huehuetenanguensis, has been reported in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and Honduras. In Mexico, the species has been collected primarily in rural areas; it has the potential to colonize human dwellings, however, its contribution to Chagas outbreaks remains unclear. In 2021, T. huehuetenanguensis was first observed at Tuxtla Gutierrez city, Chiapas; then a collection for the species was performed. A total of 308 houses were inspected in the intra and peridomestic structures. Only 3 houses (0.97%) were infested. Triatoma huehuetenangensis was the only triatomine specie recorded and four males were collected. None of the bugs tested positive for Trypanosoma infection. We do not have evidence to suggest that urban human-vector contact still limited, and a possible domestication process is possible. The presence of reservoirs, the vector species and the parasite demonstrate that Tuxtla Gutierrez could be at risk of a Chagas disease outbreak.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/84db90e43284856ed5acde66826bf785344bba9a,84db90e43284856ed5acde66826bf785344bba9a,"Carlos Espinosa-Gonzalez, Eduardo Dávalos-Becerril, Fabián Correa-Morales, Cassandra González-Acosta, Royer López-Bello, J.

"Multidisciplinary approach detects speciation within the kissing bug Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus populations (Hemiptera, Heteroptera, Reduviidae)","BACKGROUND Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus (Hemiptera-Reduviidae) is a triatomine species with a wide geographic distribution and a broad phenotypic variability. In some countries, this species is found infesting and colonising domiciliary ecotopes representing an epidemiological risk factor as a vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, etiological agent of Chagas disease. In spite of this, little is known about P. rufotuberculatus genetic diversity. METHODS Cytogenetic studies and DNA sequence analyses of one nuclear (ITS-2) and two mitochondrial DNA sequences (cyt b and coI) were carried out in P. rufotuberculatus individuals collected in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico. Moreover, a geometric morphometrics study was applied to Bolivian, Colombian, Ecuadorian and French Guiana samples. OBJECTIVES To explore the genetic and phenetic diversity of P. rufotuberculatus from different countries, combining chromosomal studies, DNA sequence analyses and geometric morphometric comparisons. FINDINGS We found two chromosomal groups differentiated by the number of X chromosomes and the chromosomal position of the ribosomal DNA clusters. In concordance, two main morphometric profiles were detected, clearly separating the Bolivian sample from the other ones. Phylogenetic DNA analyses showed that both chromosomal groups were closely related to each other and clearly separated from the remaining Panstrongylus species. High nucleotide divergence of cyt b and coI fragments were observed among P. rufotuberculatus samples from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico (Kimura 2-parameter distances higher than 9%). MAIN CONCLUSIONS Chromosomal and molecular analyses supported that the two chromosomal groups could represent different closely related species. We propose that Bolivian individuals constitute a new Panstrongylus species, being necessary a detailed morphological study for its formal description. The clear morphometric discrimination based on the wing venation pattern suggests such morphological description might be conclusive.",2022,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64cf98ca6909879bc2fa5578f206989c1c5bc958,64cf98ca6909879bc2fa5578f206989c1c5bc958,"S.

Distribution patterns of Triatominae (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in the Americas: an analysis based on networks and endemicity,"Triatominae, commonly known as kissing bugs, are a group of approximately 150 species of hematophagous reduviids, some of which are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of the Chagas disease. Distributional patterns of triatomines have been studied based on macroecological and historical biogeographic approaches, but the definition of distributional patterns and areas of endemism are yet to be defined based on objective criteria. We used two methods to identify biogeographic units in the Triatominae: the endemicity analysis based on an optimality criterion (NDM/VNDM software) and a network approach aimed to simplify and highlight the underlying structure in species distributions (Infomap Bioregions). Information on species distributions was obtained from a data paper, comprising 21 815 records for 135 triatomine species occurring in the Americas. The resulting areas of each method were clustered using a meta consensus criterion based on dissimilarities and interpreted as recurrent areas. The NDM areas show a nested structure, presenting greater restrictions to the inclusion of species in a given area, requiring broad sympatry. In contrast, bioregions emphasize spatial patterns with better‐delimited areas and species occurrences do not need to be highly congruent. When areas were clustered based on their species composition two clear patterns arose from both methods: (i) areas within the southern Amazon and southeast South America, especially in the Chacoan subregion, formed a cluster, and (ii) areas north of the Amazon, Pacific, Mesoamerica, Mexican transition zone and Nearctic formed another cluster. Moreover, within each of these two clusters, there was a latitudinal gradient of the areas in the Americas showing spatial similarity between the areas found in both methods. Results of both methods show well‐bound areas separating the triatomine fauna in the Brazilian subregions, resulting in the recognition of areas corresponding to the biomes Chaco, Pampa, Cerrado, and Caatinga, and, to a lesser extent, the Atlantic Forest.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f990ddd21499a7358bc3e4fe11d65996dd19f941,f990ddd21499a7358bc3e4fe11d65996dd19f941,"A.

"Meccus pallidipennis and Triatoma bassolsae as Main Vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi: The Case of Xayacatlán de Bravo, Puebla, Mexico","Abstract. Until recently, the State of Puebla, Mexico had no official reported chronic cases of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas. The State has conditions of social and ecological marginalization for transmission of infectious agents to be effective. Entomological indices and triatomines at the municipality of Xayacatlán de Bravo, Puebla were analyzed, as well as the DTU of circulating T. cruzi. In total, 117 triatomines were collected. The isolated strains of T. cruzi were molecularly characterized using the 24Sa rRNA and miniexon markers. Results indicated Meccus pallidipennis Stål and Triatoma bassolsae are at the municipality of Xayacatlán de Bravo. We found natural infection rate of 33.3%, and the circulating DTU was TcI. Data indicated the need to study biological and bionomic aspects associated with triatomines that are adapting to human dwelling.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fb10a1074b48852ce9096becc84e435dacc24c0e,fb10a1074b48852ce9096becc84e435dacc24c0e,"J.

Life History Data of Dipetalogaster maxima (Hemiptera: Reduviidae),"Abstract Dipetalogaster maxima (Uhler) is a triatomine species that has been found to be infected by Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas in the habitats of the most important tourist areas of Mexico. Its behavior and vectorial capacity have been scarcely studied, although such information is necessary to reliably estimate the importance of this species as a vector of T. cruzi in its distribution area. This study reports biological parameters related to the vectorial capacity of D. maxima. In particular, the egg-to-adult development time, number of blood meals required to molt, accumulative mortality, time to beginning of feeding, feeding and defecation times, fecundity, and fertility were examined. D. maxima took a median of 211 d to develop from egg to adult, requiring 11 meals in total. Almost two-thirds (63%) of specimens died during the cycle. The time to beginning of feeding was 1 min in all instars. Feeding times varied from 14 to 27 min. Most nymphs (except first-instar) defecated when feeding or immediately thereafter. A mean of 0.7 eggs/♀/day was recorded, with an eclosion rate of 27.3%. Five of the eight studied parameters (mainly defecation delay) suggest the remarkable potential vectorial capacity of D. maxima, so it is necessary to maintain permanent surveillance of domiciliary populations of D. maxima, because they may be infected with T. cruzi.

Impact of home improvements and health education on the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas in a rural area of western Mexico,"ABSTRACT: Chagas disease is one of the most important vector-borne diseases in Latin America. Instituting home improvement preventive measures and increasing health education contribute to successful control of the triatomine insect vector. The impact of home and road improvements and health education upon the inhabitants of 37 human dwellings in three small towns in western Mexico were studied. Initially, few house roofs were made of concrete and few walls were cement-lined. Almost all houses initially lacked metal window screens and none used barbed wire fences. One year after the intervention, all of these measures were more common, and almost 100% of houses continued to use window screens and barbed wire fences ten years post-intervention. By ten years post-intervention, >75% of houses had cement-lined walls. Initially, 24.3% of human dwellings were infested with Triatoma longipennis Usinger; at one and ten years post-intervention, only 2.7% of dwellings were infested. The abundance of peridomestic opossums decreased after intervention and remained low ten years later. Approximately 10% of dogs were infected in both surveys. Human infections decreased from 2.98% to zero by 13 years post-intervention. Implementation of these intervention measures led to the successful control of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas transmission in these towns.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ad779ee45b69eb2c9462118ff9d0e47dbb34d1f1,ad779ee45b69eb2c9462118ff9d0e47dbb34d1f1,"B.

"Toward New Epidemiological Landscapes of Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida, Trypanosomatidae) Transmission under Future Human-Modified Land Cover and Climatic Change in Mexico","Chagas disease, caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi, is an important yet neglected disease that represents a severe public health problem in the Americas. Although the alteration of natural habitats and climate change can favor the establishment of new transmission cycles for T. cruzi, the compound effect of human-modified landscapes and current climate change on the transmission dynamics of T. cruzi has until now received little attention. A better understanding of the relationship between these factors and T. cruzi presence is an important step towards finding ways to mitigate the future impact of this disease on human communities. Here, we assess how wild and domestic cycles of T. cruzi transmission are related to human-modified landscapes and climate conditions (LUCC-CC). Using a Bayesian datamining framework, we measured the correlations among the presence of T. cruzi transmission cycles (sylvatic, rural, and urban) and historical land use, land cover, and climate for the period 1985 to 2012. We then estimated the potential range changes of T. cruzi transmission cycles under future land-use and -cover change and climate change scenarios for 2050 and 2070 time-horizons, with respect to “green” (RCP 2.6), “business-as-usual” (RCP 4.5), and “worst-case” (RCP 8.5) scenarios, and four general circulation models. Our results show how sylvatic and domestic transmission cycles could have historically interacted through the potential exchange of wild triatomines (insect vectors of T. cruzi) and mammals carrying T. cruzi, due to the proximity of human settlements (urban and rural) to natural habitats. However, T. cruzi transmission cycles in recent times (i.e., 2011) have undergone a domiciliation process where several triatomines have colonized and adapted to human dwellings and domestic species (e.g., dogs and cats) that can be the main blood sources for these triatomines. Accordingly, Chagas disease could become an emerging health problem in urban areas. Projecting potential future range shifts of T. cruzi transmission cycles under LUCC-CC scenarios we found for RCP 2.6 no expansion of favourable conditions for the presence of T. cruzi transmission cycles. However, for RCP 4.5 and 8.5, a significant range expansion of T. cruzi could be expected. We conclude that if sustainable goals are reached by appropriate changes in socio-economic and development policies we can expect no increase in suitable habitats for T. cruzi transmission cycles.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/219612d81c2d87f1131f0f7ec048ca564f91fb02,219612d81c2d87f1131f0f7ec048ca564f91fb02,"C.

Influence of blood meal source on the biological parameters of Triatoma pallidipennis (Heteroptera: Reduviidae) from Mexico,"Chagas disease is one of the most important vector‐borne diseases in Latin America, including Mexico. Triatoma pallidipennis (Stål) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) is a Mexican triatomine vector commonly associated with different hosts. The influence of six blood meals (rabbits, rats, mice, dogs, cats and chickens) on six biological parameters of the biology of T. pallidipennis was evaluated. A significant difference was found in the period of egg‐to‐adult development between the five mammalian feeds (mean 195 days) and the chicken feed (221 days). The probability of survival was significantly lower in the chicken cohort (0.285). The total number of blood meals to moult from the first instar to the adult stage was the highest in the chicken cohort (10–15). This cohort had the significantly highest rate of females at the end cycle. The mean number of eggs laid per female and the egg eclosion rate were similar among the six food sources. Most results seemed to be influenced by the higher nutritional quality of the mammalian blood compared to the bird's blood and the increased energy expenditure required for the digestion of bird blood. These results clearly show that T. pallidipennis, unlike other triatomine species, has a high reproductive capacity when feeding on different hosts.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a41c6ceedbfe84aeb35376f344680c24e1df6f7d,a41c6ceedbfe84aeb35376f344680c24e1df6f7d,"J.

"Parasitemia and Differential Tissue Tropism in Mice Infected with Trypanosoma cruzi Isolates Obtained from Meccus phyllosoma in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico","Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasite transmitted by the feces of triatomines. Many triatomine species are found in Mexico, and various T. cruzi variants have been isolated from these species, each showing very different virulence and cell tropism. The isolates were obtained from Meccus phyllosoma specimens in three localities in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico: Tehuantitla, Vixhana, and Guichivere. The virulence of each isolate was assessed by quantifying parasitemia, survival, and histopathologic findings. The lineage of each isolate was identified using the mini-exon gene. The expression of the tssa gene during infection was detected in the heart, esophagus, gastrocnemius, and brain. Our results show that the maximum post-infection parasitemia was higher for the Tehuantitla isolate. On genotyping, all isolates were identified as T. cruzi I. The amastigotes in the heart and gastrocnemius were verified for all isolates, but in the brain only for Tehuantitla and Vixhana. The tssa expression allowed us to detect T. cruzi isolates, for Tehuantitla, predominantly in the heart. For Vixhana, a higher tssa expression was detected in gastrocnemius, and for Guichivere, it was higher in the esophagus. Results show that virulence, tropism, and tssa expression can vary, even when the isolates are derived from the same vector species, in the same region, and at similar altitudes.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7551c09850d22570e0113a6071b2edd46bbdcfb5,7551c09850d22570e0113a6071b2edd46bbdcfb5,"A.

"Domestic Triatoma spp. Infections with Trypanosoma cruzi, Household Infestations, and Molecular Identification in Oaxaca, México","Simple Summary Here, we report entomological and parasitological data on triatomine vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, in a highly endemic region of México. The morphological and molecular identification of four principal domestic species, Triatoma phyllosoma, T. barberi, T. mazzotti, and T. dimidiata, was conducted, and their presence in Oaxaca was documented based on observations from this study in comparison to municipality records from prior published studies. We document the highly endophilic behavior of four triatomine species infected with T. cruzi. The present work carried out in Oaxaca was necessary for ongoing efforts to reach the goal of reducing the Chagas disease burden in Mexico and beyond. Abstract In Latin America, Mexico is the country with the second highest annual estimated number of Chagas disease cases, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, due to vector-borne transmission. The state of Oaxaca is the location of the first documented human cases of Chagas disease in Mexico and contained the highest T. cruzi seropositive rate (3.5%) from blood donors. Here, entomological surveys, from 2017 to 2019, were conducted to collect triatomines in 124 villages of 60 municipalities. Four principal domestic Triatoma spp. (Hemiptera: Triatominae), Triatoma phyllosoma, T. barberi, T. mazzotti, and T. dimidiata, of Oaxaca, Mexico were identified by morphology and molecular analysis of the barcode region of the cytochrome oxidase 1 (cox1 or COI or CO1) gene. A total of 41 out of 83 T. phyllosoma specimens examined by microscopy were positive for T. cruzi (49%), 49 out of 171 for T. barberi (28%), 31 out of 177 for T. mazzotti (17%), and none out of 10 for T. dimidiata (0%). Overall, the infestation index was 3.1% of households containing at least one triatomine; the crowding index was a mean of two Triatoma spp./household; and the colonization index was 0.38 for households based on presence of nymphs. Geographical distribution of triatomines in Oaxaca at the municipality level and endophilic behavior is also reported. Precise identification, endophilic habits, and infection rates of these triatomines are paramount for vector control programs of the Ministry of Health of Oaxaca and beyond.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d13fc0f182a909da5fd34dde932ca9770e5a8e8,6d13fc0f182a909da5fd34dde932ca9770e5a8e8,"Nadia A Fernandez-Santos, J.
