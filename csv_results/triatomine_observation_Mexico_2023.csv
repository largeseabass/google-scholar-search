Stronger control-surveillance systems for vector-borne Chagas disease,"The multinational initiatives for the control/surveillance of Chagas launched by disease-endemic countries and the Pan American Health Organization-World Health Organization (PAHO-WHO) contributed to control house-infesting triatomine-bug populations and to reduce disease incidence. However, after 30 years, Chagas disease (CD) transmission persists the Americas. In their recent review, Rojas de Arias et al.(1) highlight the ‘practical impossibility’ of interrupting vector-borne Trypanosoma cruzi transmission, due to the zoonotic nature of most transmission cycles, with well over 100 vector species widely spread across the Americas. Then, Rojas de Arias et al.(1) emphasise the need for stronger surveillance systems to monitor and control CD. Here, I will (1) briefly discuss the prospects for interrupting vector-borne T. cruzi transmission and (2) provide an overview of some innovative approaches that, I believe, can play important roles in the development and operation of stronger control-surveillance systems for vector-borne CD. Disease control needs clear goals, and those goals often heavily depend on the natural history, risk factors, transmission routes and dynamics, pathogenesis, and treatment of the disease. Eradication, elimination, reduction of incidence, reduction of the number of severe cases, and reduction of fatality rates are all possible goals of disease control programs. (2) The most ambitious goal is disease eradication the complete elimination of an infection, with no new cases recorded in the absence of control measures. Eradication is practically impossible for zoonoses such as CD, whose etiological agent can be transmitted by 150+ vector species and infects a wide range of wild vertebrate hosts from the USA to Patagonia.(3) Therefore, the objective of a CD control program cannot be eradication, at least in the Americas. The main goal of the multinational initiatives against CD was the elimination of the strongly synanthropic, non-native populations of a few “primary” vectors mainly Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus.(4) Elimination of R. prolixus from Mexico and some countries of Central America was certified in 2011 by PAHO/WHO, but R. prolixus-infested houses were detected in rural sites in Mexico after certification.(5) Moreover, a new record of T. infestans in Mexico was recorded after 50 years.(6) In Peru, non-native T. infestans populations were not controlled in Arequipa (see references in Rojas de Arias et al.(1)). In addition, T. infestans residual foci have been detected in Brazil after certification.(7) Overall, these data indicate that elimination of non-native populations of “primary” vectors is feasible, but has many challenges. Elimination may not be the best goal for native vectors of CD.(8,9) There is a high species richness of Triatominae in the Americas.(3) Moreover, it is important to highlight that the response of some native species to vector control with insecticides was not the same as that observed for non-native species. In Brazil, for example, insecticide spraying reduced dramatically T. infestans distribution, but no significant reduction in distribution was observed for most native species. Moreover, the interruption of chemical treatment was systematically followed by recolonisation of native species,(10) mainly in unplastered houses.(11) In the state of Bahia, there was a clear reduction in the distribution of T. infestans and an increase in the relative abundance and distribution of T. sordida and T. pseudomaculata after 40 years of the vectorcontrol program. The high frequency of native triatomine species invading houses in the Americas in recent years(7,12,13) highlights the need to reinforce entomological surveillance actions to prevent CD. WHO established goals for controlling CD by 2030, including the interruption of transmission through vectorial, transfusion, transplantation and congenital routes in many endemic countries.(14) Achieving those goals is feasible for non-vector-borne transmission,(15) but many challenges remain for vector-borne transmission. Thus, I agree with de Rojas Arias et al.(1) that the WHO 2030 goal of interrupting vector-borne transmission seems unfeasible because: (i) wild triatomine populations are widespread, (ii) surveillance methods for synanthropic triatomines are not perfect, and (iii) CD still has low visibility and priority. Thus, it is necessary to reinforce the surveillance of vector-borne transmission of CD. In the next paragraphs I will highlight some innovative strategies that could help strengthen this surveillance: (I) online training for health agents (II) development of apps to identify vectors and improve surveillance with community participation and citizen science, (III) vector-borne transmission-risk mapping.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fa1818c05fd6f097382ba1499457595b0d6de12,8fa1818c05fd6f097382ba1499457595b0d6de12,R.

Chagas Disease,"Chagas disease, which is caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a leading neglected tropical disease in the United States. An estimated 240 000 to 350 000 persons in the United States are infected, primarily immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and South America, where the disease is endemic. The parasite is transmitted by the triatomine bug but can also be passed through blood transfusion, via organ transplant, or congenitally. Approximately 30% of infected persons later develop cardiac and/or gastrointestinal complications. Health care providers should consider screening at-risk patients with serologic testing. Early diagnosis and treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox can help prevent complications.",2023,10,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f06a9ee8668674184acd43a6f3b4dc1780387bbd,f06a9ee8668674184acd43a6f3b4dc1780387bbd,"N.

"Identification of a triatomine infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in an urban area of the state of Veracruz, Mexico: A comprehensive study","Chagas disease, considered a neglected disease, was initially confined to rural localities in endemic areas; however, in recent years through the process of urbanization and migration of infected people, the disease is gaining importance in urban environments. The presence of the vector in urban areas in most cases is due to the passive transport of vectors, but recently, its presence seems to be linked to vector adaptation processes associated with climate change. This paper reports the occurrence of an infected triatomine in the peridomicile of a house in an urban area of Córdoba, Veracruz, Mexico, where the species found is described, the molecular characteristics and resistance to BZN and NFX of the Trypanosoma cruzi isolate obtained, as well as serological data of the dwelling inhabitants. These urban disease scenarios make it possible to generate new scientific knowledge and enable the creation of new control strategies for Chagas disease vectors.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d5e1a6694ace87a189e007c4139f19f39f3546b,3d5e1a6694ace87a189e007c4139f19f39f3546b,"Ochoa-Martínez Paulina, López-Monteon Aracely, López-Domínguez Jaime, Torres-Montero Jesús, Domínguez-Guillén Jorge Alberto, Ramos-Ligonio Angel"
"Triatoma pallidipennis (Stål, 1872) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) and its potential for infestation in Tecozautla, Hidalgo state, Mexico","ABSTRACT: Triatoma pallidipennis is an exclusive and widely distributed species in Mexico and one of the three main vectors that transmit Chagas disease in the country. The state of Hidalgo is an endemic area for Chagas disease where the presence of several species of triatomines has been reported. The objective of our work was to describe the morphology, colonization process, and reproductive behavior of T. pallidipennis in Guadalupe, Tecozautla, two years after the first collection of a specimen in this region. A total of 28 specimens was collected at both domicile and peridomicile, showing a 17.8% infection rate. The main collection site was a woodshed, and despite the collection of adults in the dwelling, we did not find eggs, exuviae, or nymphs. One female monitored from collection day until death laid 566 eggs, with a hatching rate of 95%, showing an increase of oviposition when cohabited with a male. The results showed the capacity that T. pallidipennis has to infest areas (mainly human dwellings) when it settles down, which would imply a risk for the population that lives in the locality.",2023,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03f815a4b3e192498f166ff913db2aef9a0985f9,03f815a4b3e192498f166ff913db2aef9a0985f9,"R.

"Trypanosoma cruzi in Mexican Neotropical vectors and mammals: wildlife, livestock, pets, and human population.","OBJECTIVE
To provide primary evidence of Trypanosoma cruzi landscape genetics in the Mexican Neotropics.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trypanosoma cruzi and discrete typing units (DTU) prevalence were analyzed in landscape communities of vectors, wildlife, livestock, pets, and sympatric human populations using endpoint PCR and sequencing of all relevant amplicons from mitochondrial (kDNA) and nuclear (ME, 18S, 24Sα) gene markers.


RESULTS
Although 98% of the infected sample-set (N=2 963) contained single or mixed infections of DTUI (TcI, 96.2%) and TcVI (22.6%), TcIV and TcII were also identified. Sensitivity of individual markers varied and was dependent on host taxon; kDNA, ME and 18S combined identified 95% of infections. ME genotyped 90% of vector infections, but 60% of mammals (36% wildlife), while neither 18S nor 24Sα typed more than 20% of mammal infections.


CONCLUSION
Available gene fragments to identify or genotype T. cruzi are not universally sensitive for all landscape parasite populations, highlighting important T. cruzi heteroge- neity among mammal reservoir taxa and triatomine species.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8d7715052afdc74ec4d2fef2f33d7236fb1ea465,8d7715052afdc74ec4d2fef2f33d7236fb1ea465,"Amaia Izeta-Alberdi, A.

Temporal assessment of entomological surveillance of Trypanosoma cruzi vectors in an endemic area of northeastern Brazil,"Entomological surveillance is essential for the control of triatomines and the prevention of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in humans and domestic animals. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate entomological indicators and triatomine control during the period from 2005 to 2015 in an endemic area in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. This observational and retrospective study was developed based on data analysis related to active entomological surveillance activities and chemical control of infested housing units (HU) in the Agreste mesoregion of the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, in the period between 2005 to 2015. The quantitative analysis of housing units surveyed for entomological indicators was performed by linear regression of random effects (p < 0.05). The effect of the number of HU surveyed on the entomological indicators was analyzed by fitting a linear random effects regression model and an increasing intradomiciliary colonization rate was significant. In the period evaluated 92,156 housing units were investigated and the presence of triatomines was reported in 4,639 (5.0%). A total of 4,653 specimens of triatomines were captured and the species recorded were Triatoma pseudomaculata (n = 1,775), Triatoma brasiliensis (n = 1,569), Rhodnius nasutus (n = 741) and Panstrongylus lutzi (n = 568), with an index of natural infection by T. cruzi of 2.2%. Only 53.1% of the infested HU were subjected to chemical control. Moreover, there was a decrease in the total number of HU surveyed over time associated with an increase in the index of intradomiciliary colonization (p = 0.004). These data demonstrated that entomological surveillance and control of vectors in the Agreste mesoregion of the state has been discontinued, emphasizing the need for more effective public policies to effectively control the vectors, in order to avoid the exposure of humans and domestic animals to the risk of T. cruzi infection.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0b22db4bf7e5405876a9dc9d13acee459e07a0d,b0b22db4bf7e5405876a9dc9d13acee459e07a0d,"George Harisson Felinto Sampaio, Andressa Noronha Barbosa da Silva, Christiane Carlos Araújo de Negreiros, Nathan Ravi Medeiros Honorato, R.

"New Records of Triatomine: Triatoma rubida and T. sinaloensis at Sonora, Northwestern Mexico","Abstract. To update a list of arthropod group-species, including triatomines, in the State of Sonora, northwestern Mexico, entomological surveys were done during the spring of 2022 in conserved areas of the state. Triatomines Triatoma rubida (Uhler) and T. sinaloensis Ryckman (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) were found living in nests of woodrats, Neotoma sp., and California roadrunners, Geococcyx californianus (Lesson). Because T. rubida is one of the main vectors of Chagas disease in North America, and T. sinaloensis has been found naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, surveillance of the species should be essential for Chagas disease control programs in northwestern Mexico.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e054bbba65d8e23aed661388f95226fe86e25d4,3e054bbba65d8e23aed661388f95226fe86e25d4,"Antonio A.

"Chagas Disease, a Triatomine Bug-Transmitted Protozoan Infection","Chagas disease is a potentially fatal, chronic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan parasite. It causes 6 to 8 million cases and 50,000 deaths each year. Humans and animals usually become infected with T. cruzi via triatomine bugs, also called kissing or conenose bugs, found only in the Americas. Disease transmitted by triatomine bugs generally occurs in rural areas of Mexico, Central America, and South America, but it is becoming more prevalent in non-endemic areas like the US as asymptomatic infected people move from rural to urban areas of Latin America and other regions.  In the US, approximately 300,000 people are currently infected with Chagas disease, 18,000 in Florida. Most if not all of them were infected elsewhere; local transmission of Chagas disease via triatomines in the US is rare. Awareness and understanding of Chagas disease are critical to detect and treat cases early. This publication is intended for anyone interested in learning more about Chagas disease.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c936b4ef3fd874af4ee71427408b470a8c35ba9b,c936b4ef3fd874af4ee71427408b470a8c35ba9b,"Bethany R.

Infection with Trypanosoma Cruzi Chagas and Characterization of Human Habitats of Triatoma Picturata (Usinger) in Western Mexico,"ABSTRACT: Chagas disease is one of the most important vector-borne diseases in Latin America. Triatoma picturata (Usinger), distributed in western Mexico, is one of the most important vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas. Knowing the type and materials used for building homes could lead to improved methods for controlling triatomines by focusing efforts on controlling every species of triatomine in its specific microhabitat. Houses in three studied localities of western Mexico that harbored T. picturata were characterized, as well as two entomological indices. Infestation Index values varied from 10.8% to 51.9% in the three localities, whereas Natural Infection Index values varied from 18.1% to 35.2%. Characteristics of houses invaded by T. picturata also varied. In Juan Gil Preciado, with the highest Entomological Index values, most houses were built of adobe walls with a roof of clay tiles and a dirt floor, and included the presence of domestic animals. Our data indicate that the potential risk of infection with T. cruzi differs markedly for inhabitants of the three studied localities, which demonstrates the importance of studying local populations of triatomines. Our study should contribute to decision-making regarding triatomine control efforts by providing profiles of houses that are more susceptible to triatomine invasion.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b192815a59d10c225cece8523d79d11044d83e1b,b192815a59d10c225cece8523d79d11044d83e1b,"T.

Crossing experiments detect partial reproductive isolation among populations of Triatoma longipennis (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae).,"Chagas disease is an important vector-borne disease endemic in Mexico. Of the 33 triatomine species found in Mexico, Triatoma longipennis (Usinger) is considered among the most important because of its infection indices, capacity for transmitting Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas), and its distribution areas. Here, we describe the results of a reproductive isolation analysis among 5 populations of T. longipennis collected from representative areas of Mexico. Fertility and segregation of morphological characteristics were examined in two generations of hybrids. The percentage of pairs with (fertile) offspring varied from 30% to 100% in the parental crosses, while these values varied from 0 to 100% in the intersite crosses. Our results indicate partial reproductive isolation among these populations. These findings shed light on the potential presence of a cryptic species complex of T. longipennis in Mexico.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64ef00940acc414fc5ba14be3b7cc3fe5d51eae7,64ef00940acc414fc5ba14be3b7cc3fe5d51eae7,"J.

Antimicrobial activity of NK cells to Trypanosoma cruzi infected human primary Keratinocytes,"Infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is causative for Chagas disease, which is a highly neglected tropical disease prevalent in Latin America. Humans are primary infected through vectorial transmission by blood-sucking triatomine bugs. The parasite enters the human host through mucous membranes or small skin lesions. Since keratinocytes are the predominant cell type in the epidermis, they play a critical role in detecting disruptions in homeostasis and aiding in pathogen elimination by the immune system in the human skin as alternative antigen-presenting cells. Interestingly, keratinocytes also act as a reservoir for T. cruzi, as the skin has been identified as a major site of persistent infection in mice with chronic Chagas disease. Moreover, there are reports of the emergence of T. cruzi amastigote nests in the skin of immunocompromised individuals who are experiencing reactivation of Chagas disease. This observation implies that the skin may serve as a site for persistent parasite presence during chronic human infection too and underscores the significance of investigating the interactions between T. cruzi and skin cells. Consequently, the primary objective of this study was to establish and characterize the infection kinetics in human primary epidermal keratinocytes (hPEK). Our investigation focused on surface molecules that either facilitated or hindered the activation of natural killer (NK) cells, which play a crucial role in controlling the infection. To simulate the in vivo situation in humans, an autologous co-culture model was developed to examine the interactions between T. cruzi infected keratinocytes and NK cells. We evaluated the degranulation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity of NK cells in response to the infected keratinocytes. We observed a strong activation of NK cells by infected keratinocytes, despite minimal alterations in the expression of activating or inhibitory ligands on NK cell receptors. However, stimulation with recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a cytokine known to be present in significant quantities during chronic T. cruzi infections in the host, resulted in a substantial upregulation of these ligands on primary keratinocytes. Overall, our findings suggest the crucial role of NK cells in controlling acute T. cruzi infection in the upper layer of the skin and shed light on keratinocytes as potential initial targets of infection.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6718100b49652b56fd9e0057096369ebf7896ca6,6718100b49652b56fd9e0057096369ebf7896ca6,"Keshia Kroh, J.

Parasites: The Inside Story,"P The Inside Story shows how parasites coexisted and spread around the world through host migration, particularly through humans, and researches their origin and evolution. The book describes how the choice of host has affected the successful survival of some parasites and avoidance of extinction. The authors show how parasites influence and manipulate their intermediate host, which makes them more visible and easier prey for the next host, causing the host to “look foolish.” The authors use novel and entertaining approaches to explore their subject, such as describing how the Israelite Jonah spent 3 days in the belly of a whale and what parasites he might have encountered during that 3-day stay. Another entertaining approach was participation in the parasite Olympics, where parasites earned medals according to their success and survival by choosing and adjusting to their hosts. Ascaris lumbricoides is a gold medal winner as one of the most durable internal parasites of humans. However, the book overlooked Strongyloides stercoralis, which can cause hyperinfection syndrome in immunocompromised hosts and is considered an emerging infectious disease and deserves an honorary Olympic medal. Babesiosis is another notable emerging parasitic disease that was overlooked. I appreciated the novel and appealing way in which the authors show how parasites affect other species and human lives, while also incorporating their nonharmful roles, as in the case of mutualism and commensalism. I loved the immense and vivid imagery used to describe the breathtaking basin of the Congo River but was saddened that many persons living along the river might not continue to see that beautiful scenery because of river blindness caused by Onchocerca volvulus. The stories, connections to real persons, and references to at least 3 movies and 1 television series indicate the detailed efforts involved in writing this book. The book has a high level of scientific detail as it dives into history, ecology, evolution, and future outlooks. The authors discuss how climate change is affecting parasite existence. An example is the migration of triatomine kissing bugs to the southern half of the United States, which might increase the risk for Trypanosoma cruzi transmission, causing Chagas disease (to which the book attributes Charles Darwin’s death, from an infection he acquired during a trip to South America). The authors also elaborate on international scientific collaboration during epidemiologic investigations, such as the collaboration between researchers from the United States and Mongolia during a hantavirus infection outbreak in New Mexico. Readers will learn about parasite eradication campaigns, some of which did not turn out well, as was the case for the Schistosoma mansoni eradication campaign in Egypt that resulted in populationwide infections with hepatitis C virus. The book has 29 color photos, making the stories only more vibrant, and helps in understanding parasite life cycles and in making diagnoses. This book will appeal to readers interested in emerging infectious diseases, nonparasitologists, scientists, and clinicians and is an admirable expedition into the amazing world of parasites.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4654f475630f38b150a637624817a85787cadf79,4654f475630f38b150a637624817a85787cadf79,Rezhan H.

"Chagas Disease, A Review of the Literature","Chagas disease is a vector-borne (triatomine) infection caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Synonyms for this disease are: American trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease and T. cruzi infection. 10, 5 The most common form of transmission of Chagas disease is through hematophagous triatomine insects (triatominae), which develop in dwellings in precarious conditions, The disease can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, organ transplantation, oral and congenital routes, and even more rarely by exceptional routes such as sexual contact and non-Triatominae vectors. American Trypanosomiasis is endemic in much of Mexico, Central and South America 1,11. it is estimated that ~6 million individuals are infected throughout Latin America, while ~300,000 are infected in the U.S.1, 10, 11,16 Chagas disease has two clearly differentiated phases. Initially, the acute phase lasts about two months after infection, they may have a skin lesion or a purplish swelling of an eyelid, they may have fever, headache, enlarged lymph nodes, pallor, muscle aches, shortness of breath, swelling, and abdominal or chest pain. During the chronic phase, the infection can cause sudden death due to cardiac arrhythmias or progressive heart failure due to destruction of the cardiac muscle and its innervations. 15 Appropriate diagnostics for acute infection, nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) from blood is recommended; For chronic infection, serological testing is employed. Antitrypanosomal agents, benznidazole and nifurtimox, have shown efficacy in treating T. cruzi infection, The most serious complication is chronic chagasic heart disease, since it is the main cause of death in sick patients. 16",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02a92ce74e01835ca926db4cf45a006f0e26ac5f,02a92ce74e01835ca926db4cf45a006f0e26ac5f,"Karen Denis Gómez Arciniega, Ramsés Erwin López Castellón"
The distribution of triatomine (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in Illinois and Missouri: historical records and specimen submissions from community science programs.,"Triatomine species (kissing bugs) infected with Trypanosoma cruzi are found across the southern United States. The northern limits of Trypanosoma cruzi infected kissing bugs are less understood. The objective of this work was to describe the locations of kissing bugs from Illinois and Missouri based on historical records, submissions to Texas A&M University's (TAMU) Kissing Bug Community Science Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and records from online platforms (iNaturalist, BugGuide, and GBIF) up to and including 2022. A total of 228 records were discovered, including 186 from historical or observation platforms and 42 specimens submitted to TAMU or CDC. Species included Triatoma sanguisuga (221 total records, 9 nymphs) and Triatoma lecticularia (7 records). Notably, nearly all (24/26) records submitted to TAMU were collected indoors. Twelve of the 30 (40%) specimens tested were positive for the presence of T. cruzi, including parasite discrete taxonomic units TcI and TcIV. One triatomine sample had been found in a bed feeding on the submitter; this bug was positive for T. cruzi and had evidence of human blood in its gut. Records suggest a ubiquitous distribution in Missouri and potentially to the northernmost border in Illinois. Further investigations into triatomine distribution and infection status are needed within states assumed to be northern limits in order to create public health and veterinary health messaging and baseline distributional maps from which to measure future range shifts in relation to a changing climate.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26c765439f3ffb2a1f84d0a00d82100d54b09b8f,26c765439f3ffb2a1f84d0a00d82100d54b09b8f,"Ellen M.
