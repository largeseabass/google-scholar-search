"Policy feedback, varieties of federalism, and the politics of health‐care funding in the United States, Mexico, and Canada","Long before the COVID‐19 pandemic, health‐care spending became a key policy issue across the OECD. Comparing recent institutional trends in public health‐care financing in three federal countries—Canada, the United States, and Mexico—this article explores the political struggles over fiscal federalism in health care related to both vertical and horizontal imbalances that can generate regional tensions and pit subnational governments against one another and, especially, against the national government. Grounded in a historical institutionalist perspective, the article shows how different institutional legacies shape current conflicts over federal health‐care funding in these three highly dissimilar federal countries. Such an analysis stresses the role of policy feedback in social politics and the enduring “varieties of federalism” in North American public health‐care funding. More specifically, the article shows how the distinct nature of policy feedback effects in the United States, Mexico, and Canada helps explain why the two former countries recently witnessed major changes in intergovernmental relations over fiscal federalism for health care while the latter did not.Bode, Ingo, and Jorge E.

Current status and future trends for pork production in the United States of America and Canada,"Pork production is a significant agricultural enterprise in the United States and Canada. The United States is the third-largest global producer of pork and Canada ranks seventh in pork production. The North American Free Trade Agreement and its successor, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, have facilitated trade and integration between the two countries. The majority of production systems are modern and intensive, characterized by large vertically integrated farms using advanced technologies. Both nations benefit from their status as major producers of feed grains, with the United States leading in corn and soybeans, while Canada excels in canola and barley production. The regulatory frameworks for food safety, animal welfare, and environmental stewardship differ slightly, with the FDA and USDA overseeing these aspects in the United States, and Health Canada and the Canada Food Inspection Agency in Canada. The United States and Canada also have well-established distribution networks for pork products, relying on both domestic and international markets. Export markets play a crucial role, with the United States being a major importer of Canadian pigs, and both countries exploring opportunities in Asia. Despite a rise in global demand, domestic pork consumption trends differ, with per capita consumption remaining stable in the USA and declining in Canada. Changing consumer preferences, including a demand for ethically raised and locally sourced pork, may influence production practices. Future trends in pig production include a focus on consumer concerns, sustainability, disease prevention, reduction of antimicrobial use, and advancements in technology. The industry is adapting to challenges such as disease outbreaks and changing regulations, with a strong emphasis on animal welfare. Labor and workforce considerations, along with advancements in technology and automation, are expected to shape the efficiency of pork production in the future.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8a6545b429cce1a2b26a2f082d8172637a5757a8,8a6545b429cce1a2b26a2f082d8172637a5757a8,"[{'authorId': '2294659366', 'name': 'M.

Burden and Impact of Reactogenicity among Adults Receiving COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States and Canada: Results from a Prospective Observational Study,"As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, vaccination remains a critical tool to reduce the COVID-19 burden. Vaccine reactogenicity and the impact on work productivity/daily activities are recognized as contributing factors to vaccine hesitancy. To encourage continued COVID-19 vaccination, a more complete understanding of the differences in reactogenicity and impairment due to vaccine-related side effects across currently available vaccines is necessary. The 2019nCoV-406 study (n = 1367) was a prospective observational study of reactogenicity and associated impairments in adults in the United States and Canada who received an approved/authorized COVID-19 vaccine. Compared with recipients of mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccines, a smaller percentage of NVX-CoV2373 booster recipients reported local and systemic reactogenicity. This study’s primary endpoint (percentage of participants with ≥50% overall work impairment on ≥1 of the 6 days post-vaccination period) did not show significant differences. However, the data suggest that NVX-CoV2373 booster recipients trended toward being less impaired overall than recipients of an mRNA booster; further research is needed to confirm this observed trend. The results of this real-world study suggest that NVX-CoV2373 may be a beneficial vaccine option with limited impact on non-work activities, in part due to the few reactogenicity events after vaccination.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd689cdc44b7995c6116f31ba5fa960c521b9ce6,dd689cdc44b7995c6116f31ba5fa960c521b9ce6,"[{'authorId': '2267901204', 'name': 'M.

Reactogenicity Differences between COVID-19 Vaccines: A Prospective Observational Study in the United States and Canada,"Participants in studies investigating COVID-19 vaccines commonly report reactogenicity events, and concerns about side effects may lead to reluctance to receive updated COVID-19 vaccinations. A real-world, post hoc analysis, observational 2019nCoV-406 study, was conducted to examine reactogenicity within the first 2 days after vaccination with either a protein-based vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) or an mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) in individuals who previously completed a primary series. Propensity score adjustments were conducted to address potential confounding. The analysis included 1130 participants who received a post-primary series dose of NVX-CoV2373 (n = 303) or an mRNA vaccine (n = 827) during the study period. Within the first 2 days after vaccination, solicited systemic reactogenicity events (adjusted) were reported in 60.5% of participants who received NVX-CoV2373 compared with 84.3% of participants who received an mRNA vaccine; moreover, 33.9% and 61.4%, respectively, reported [≥]3 systemic reactogenicity symptoms. The adjusted mean (95% CI) number of systemic symptoms was 1.8 (1.6-2.0) and 3.2 (3.0-3.4), respectively. Local reactogenicity events (adjusted) were reported in 73.4% and 91.7% of participants who received NVX-CoV2373 and mRNA vaccines, respectively; the adjusted mean (95% CI) number of local symptoms was 1.5 (1.33-1.61) and 2.4 (2.31-2.52), respectively. These results support the use of adjuvanted, protein-based NVX-CoV2373 as an immunization option with low reactogenicity.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12821056e07cd5516a0c05f78499106ca6f164de,12821056e07cd5516a0c05f78499106ca6f164de,"[{'authorId': '2267901204', 'name': 'M.

"Representational Style Across National and Constituency Contexts: Members of Parliament in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom","In this study, we ask how and why do Members of Parliament adopt different representational styles? Looking at MPs in four Westminster-style democracies, we identify differences between MPs and inductively explore influences on representational styles by first using participant observation to gain deep insights into the activities of a small sample of MPs and then by using semi-structured interviews from a larger sample to elucidate findings from the observations across states. Our primary focus is the method of connection between representative and citizen, as fostered by the representative while present in the constituency. Despite similar institutional and electoral contexts across countries, we find a significant variation that is influenced by both country-level and constituency-level factors. Findings suggest a continuum from highly service-oriented to highly symbolic-oriented styles, where MPs from the UK illustrate the former, and MPs from Canada illustrate the latter, though with further variation at the constituency level that is based, in part, upon both geography and demographics.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b53625c4101843ebb0e741ff872dba7af46341d,8b53625c4101843ebb0e741ff872dba7af46341d,"[{'authorId': '118098110', 'name': 'Kelly Blidook'}, {'authorId': '46178575', 'name': 'Royce Koop'}]"
Desk Review of Impact of Coronavirus on the Aviation Sector in the United States,"Desk review in this context is an assessment of global pandemic event of COVID-19 and Omicron specifically as it concerns United States of America. The purpose of this research is to determine the impact of COVID-19 on aviation sector of United States. This is with a view to assess pattern of passengers’ movement and employees’ employment status after the pandemic in the United States’ air transport industry. Downloaded research articles and data from Bureau of Transportation Statistics - United States Department of Transportation were analyzed with descriptive statistics of tables, graphs and histogram. Apart from recorded loss of lives and restriction of movements, demand for air travel and tourism was greatly affected by the pandemic. There was a steady increase in passenger movement by air across South America, Central America, Canada and North America regions of United States. It could be observed that, North America demands for air travel during and a bit after COVID-19 was above all regions followed by Canada with a steady observation for about six months before rise in travel demand. Full time employees recorded in the airline from 2010 to 2022 on monthly basis have not been matched since the pandemic especially from October to December. While acknowledging the roles played by Centre for Diseases Control and World Health Organization to contain the pandemic, their recommendations from history must be followed by all stakeholders in future.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/313b1bca92ffa8ad4098f7f6d00e399a3f8abe47,313b1bca92ffa8ad4098f7f6d00e399a3f8abe47,"[{'authorId': '2282645506', 'name': 'Temitope Paul Babarinde'}, {'authorId': '115334855', 'name': 'O.

Features of the European Union's trade and economic relations with Canada and Mexico,"Комплексный анализ торговли Северной Америки и Европейского союза проводится достаточно редко, причем, в основном, когда говорят о взаимодействии ЕС и Северной Америки, то имеют в виду отношения США и Европейского союза. Несмотря на незначительный уровень торгового взаимодействия Европейского Союза и таких стран Северной Америки, как Мексика или Канада, изучение его с научной точки зрения представляет особую важность. На фоне исторических событий 1990-х годов и усиления европейской интеграции участились попытки Европейского Союза закрепиться в качестве ключевого экономического партнера среди стран Северной Америки. В современной ситуации в связи с увеличением поставок сжиженного газа становится понятно, что заключенные ранее договоренности требуют трансформации с целью снижения уровня зависимости Европейского Союза от Соединенных Штатов Америки и увеличения экономического участия ЕС среди других стран.
 A comprehensive analysis of trade between North America and the European Union is carried out quite rarely, and, mainly, when talking about the interaction of the EU and North America, they mean the relations between the United States and the European Union. Despite the low level of trade interaction between the European Union and North American countries such as Mexico or Canada, studying it is also a very important factor. Against the background of the historical events of the 1990s and the strengthening of European integration, the European Union's attempts to gain a foothold as an important economic partner among other North American countries have become more frequent. In the current situation, due to the increase in liquefied natural gas supplies, it becomes clear that the previously concluded agreements require transformation in order to reduce the level of dependence on the United States of America and increase the economic participation of the EU among other mainland countries.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b647515c2708f82e9296d40cefe496e230a13f9b,b647515c2708f82e9296d40cefe496e230a13f9b,"[{'authorId': '2310727937', 'name': 'А.О.

#ResisteGozando (joy as resistance): On the healing power of dance at the US–Mexico border,"This article explores the personal and political significance of dancing for migrants trapped at the US–Mexico border, waiting to apply for asylum in the United States. Past research has often framed waiting as empty, static, boring, or even violent. Nevertheless, an emergent literature shows how people in contexts of violence also exercise creativity and care as embodied paths to collective healing. Drawing on nearly three years of patchwork ethnography at Comunidades, a cultural center and migrant shelter in Tijuana, Mexico, including participant observation in person and over Zoom as well as in-depth interviews with migrants and staff, we explore how dance affects migrants’ relationships to trauma and offers its own mode of politics. We show how forced waiting was affectively complex. On one hand, being stranded at the border left migrants vulnerable to state and cartel abuse. At the same time, dancing helped people ‘come home’ to themselves, practice solidarity, and refuse dominant narratives of their suffering. In short, migrants can use creative practices – including but not limited to dance – for embodied healing, community building, and resistance to larger regimes of violence.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3ae4ee939712029605c89cf5eaf0861bdede1b4b,3ae4ee939712029605c89cf5eaf0861bdede1b4b,"[{'authorId': '2300927028', 'name': 'Leslie Meyer'}, {'authorId': '2300941648', 'name': 'Abigail Andrews'}, {'authorId': '2300940876', 'name': 'Paulina Olvera Cañez'}]"

International tourism and trade in Mexico: A Granger causality test (2012- 2020),"Limited information is available on the factors that impact the flow of international tourists to Mexico, a top global tourist destination in the 21st century. Our study utilizes the Granger causality test in vector autoregressive (VAR) models to examine the potential causal relationship between international trade and international tourism flows with Mexico’s key travel partners from 2012 to 2020. Analysis of data from trade balance and foreign tourist visits to Mexico reveals a Granger causality linking trade balance growth to increased international tourist arrivals from the United States, Argentina, and Italy. Conversely, in the case of Canada, growth in tourist visits influences the trade balance between the two countries. No significant Granger-causality was found for the United Kingdom, Colombia, Spain, Brazil, France, and Germany.

"Black Terns (Chlidonias niger) beyond the breeding grounds: Occurrence, relative density, and habitat associations in the northern Gulf of Mexico","ABSTRACT North American Black Terns (Chlidonias niger) breed primarily in the Prairie Pothole region of southern Canada and the northern United States, winter in Central and South American waters, and often migrate through the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM). This species has exhibited long-term population declines and is exposed to a myriad of anthropogenic threats in the nGoM, including oil spills, with an estimated 800–1,000 injured during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, yet historical studies of Black Terns' use of the nGoM are sparse, with inconsistent spatial and temporal coverage. Using vessel-based observations collected from 2017 to 2019, we characterize Black Tern spatial and temporal occurrence in marine waters of the nGoM. We develop 2 separate habitat models: one describing spatial and temporal aspects of Black Terns occurrence and the other describing the relative density when present. In 10 months of survey effort, January–October, we observed Black Terns in 7 (Mar–May and Jul–Oct), predominantly on the continental shelf at <200 m depth. Relative densities were greatest in the fall, coinciding with Black Terns' southward migration. Spatial distribution and habitat models suggest an association with river mouths or ports, as well as cool, productive waters, frequently associated near the outflow of the Mississippi River and just off the coast from Corpus Christi, Texas. The enhanced understanding of Black Terns in the nGoM could inform the preparation for, and response to, future oiling events or provide insight into potential interactions with the installation of offshore wind farms and aquaculture. RÉsumÉ (French) Les guifettes noires d'Amérique du Nord (Chlidonias niger) se reproduisent principalement dans la région des Prairies Pothole du sud du Canada et du nord des États-Unis, hivernent dans les eaux d'Amérique centrale et du Sud et migrent souvent à travers le nord du golfe du Mexique (nGoM). Cette espèce a montré des déclins de population à long terme et est exposée à une myriade de menaces anthropiques dans le nGoM, y compris les marées noires, avec environ 800 à 1 000 individus blessés lors de la marée noire de Deepwater Horizon, mais des études historiques sur l'utilisation du nGoM par les guifettes noires sont rares, avec une couverture spatiale et temporelle incohérente. À l'aide d'observations basées sur des navires recueillies de 2017 à 2019, nous caractérisons l'occurrence spatiale et temporelle de la guifette noire dans les eaux marines du nGoM. Nous développâmes deux modèles d'habitat distincts: l'un décrivant les aspects spatiaux et temporels de l'occurrence des guifettes noires et l'autre décrivant la densité relative lorsqu'elles sont présentes. Au cours des 10 mois d'enquêtes, de janvier à octobre, nous observâmes des guifettes noires en sept mois (de mars à mai et de juillet à octobre), principalement sur le plateau continental à <200 m de profondeur. Les densités relatives étaient les plus élevées en automne, coïncidant avec la migration de la guifette noire vers le sud. Les modèles de distribution spatiale et d'habitat suggèrent une association avec des embouchures ou des ports de rivières, ainsi qu'avec des eaux fraîches et productives, fréquemment associées près de l'embouchure du fleuve Mississippi et juste au large de Corpus Christi, Texas. Une meilleure compréhension de la guifette noire dans le nGoM pourrait éclairer la préparation et la réponse aux futures marées noires ou donner un aperçu des interactions potentielles avec l'installation de parcs éoliens offshore et l'aquaculture.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73b021f4fa155c4c18e3f186fbe96cbf686e6efe,73b021f4fa155c4c18e3f186fbe96cbf686e6efe,"[{'authorId': '2308278013', 'name': 'Pamela E.

Consultations on the System of Indigenous and Afromexican Communal Security and the Right to be Consulted in Mexico,"
The right to be consulted is a legal institution that originated in 1989 in the United Nations Convention 169, requiring states to conduct a consultation process of Indigenous peoples and communities on issues potentially impacting them. The Mexican state has subsequently implemented the right to be consulted in its legal system. The consultation processes were often riddled with inconsistencies and the violation of the rights of Indigenous communities and peoples. In this paper I analysed the case study of the consultation process in Guerrero, by researching press articles, engaging in participant observation and conducting interviews. I looked for similarities between the Guerrero consultations and past consultations in Juchitán, Sonora, and Campeche. I identified several violations and manipulations consistent with the history of the right to be consulted. In the last part of the article, I compared the proposed acts and established their potential impact on security in Guerrero.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e7853a69859f467b582d6be5de09ee873f2bca52,e7853a69859f467b582d6be5de09ee873f2bca52,"[{'authorId': '2278115445', 'name': 'Alexander Stachurski'}]"
"Prevalence of obesity, diabetes and hypertension in immigrant populations in northeastern Mexico","Introduction Hispanic immigrants are a fast-growing population in the United States of America (USA) that disproportionately suffer from chronic diseases. Despite the increasing prevalence of obesity in Latin-American countries, only a few studies have examined the onset of chronic diseases in Mexican and Central American migrants in Mexico. Objective The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension in Central American immigrants who are in the process of traveling through northeastern Mexico to the United States. Methods An observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted among migrants, mostly Central Americans. Migrants who agreed to participate in the study were interviewed face-to-face by researchers to obtain their sociodemographic data. To obtain the prevalence, many health indicators related to obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, including weight, height, fasting glucose, and blood pressure, were measured. Results In total, 520 migrants were interviewed; sociodemographic data indicated that most participants were men (76%), from Honduras (72.6%), single (61.2%), and have elementary level of education (48.6%). The somatometric evaluation revealed that 28.9% were diagnosed as overweight, 10.7% with obesity, and 3.3% with malnutrition. Of less prevalence, 8.8% were detected with hypertension and 4.6% had fasting hyperglycemia. The mean participant age was 29.11 ± 10.00 years. For each participant, the average weight was 66.72 ± 13.09 kg; the average height was 1.64 ± 0.08 m; the average body mass index (BMI) was 24.59 ± 4.32; the mean systolic and diastolic pressures were 116.26 ± 15.13 and 74 ± 9.65, respectively; and the average glycemia was 100.97 ± 21.99. El Salvador showed the highest proportion of people with diabetes (14.7%). Women who participated in this study had a higher proportion of obesity (23.4%, p = 0.02) and overweight (36.2%) than men (8.4 and 29.2%, respectively).

"MP40-15 THE PREVALENCE OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY AMONG PATIENTS IN A TERTIARY METABOLIC STONE CLINIC IN ONTARIO, CANADA","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Kidney stone prevalence has been thought to increase over time and rise in conjunction with rising rates of such associated factors as diabetes, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. We sought to determine the temporal trends in kidney stone prevalence among adults in the United States. METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study evaluated the lifetime prevalence of kidney stones using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from six cycles: 2007-2008, 2009-2010, 2011-2012, 2013-2014, 2015-2016, and 2017-2020, a 10.6-year period. Survey statistical methods were used to estimate kidney stone prevalence overall and within subgroups de ﬁ ned by sex, age group, and race/ethnicity. Prevalence values were reported as percent and standard error (SE). RESULTS: The analysis included 38,329 participants aged 20 and older. The weighted prevalence of kidney stones remained stable from 8.9% (SE 0.6%) in 2007-2008 to 9.9% (SE 0.6%) in 2017-2020 (p [ 0.23). Only kidney stone prevalence in females increased signi ﬁ - cantly during this period, from 6.5% (SE 0.5%) to 9.1% (SE 0.9%) (p [ 0.01). The prevalence of kidney stones remained stable during the study period in males, across age groups, and among racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: While the overall lifetime prevalence of kidney stones in American adults has not changed signi ﬁ cantly over the last decade, there is a concerning upward trend in kidney stone disease among females that warrants further investigation.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/276a7a5303d794ab81cdcba6bd947ce3a0008d4a,276a7a5303d794ab81cdcba6bd947ce3a0008d4a,"[{'authorId': '2296856551', 'name': 'Mario Basulto-Martínez'}, {'authorId': '2282225834', 'name': 'Tariq Alotaibi'}, {'authorId': '15341784', 'name': 'J.

China-Mexico Economic Relationship in the Context of China’s Penetration in Latin America,"Abstract China’s relationship with Latin America countries experienced a process of significant expansion over the past two decades. Even though Latin America was not considered as part of the BRI when it was first established, China designed its economic strategy toward the region by emphasizing investment, financial and industrial capacity cooperation, besides trade. Afterwards, China invited Latin American countries to participate in the BRI at the China–Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) Ministerial Forum in Santiago in January 2018. Twenty-one Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries have signed up to the BRI. However, there are few LAC countries that have not done so, among them the region’s largest economies such as Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, although Brazil is with full AIIB membership. This paper focuses on the specific economic relations between China and Mexico, as far as Mexico is the less involved LA country into the BRI, and Mexico’s position toward China is more aligned with that of its North American partners than to the Latin American countries. This article analyzes the specific situation of Mexico, characterized by its deep integration and dependency on the US market and examines the current economic relations of China and Mexico, considering the impact of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement on the bilateral economic relations. The structure of bilateral trade between Mexico and China is also examined, using the Grubel-Lloyd Index (GLI).",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bb2d1fc4baae172740746bcf4e5c78f98e391555,bb2d1fc4baae172740746bcf4e5c78f98e391555,"[{'authorId': '2529620', 'name': 'Nathalie Aminian'}, {'authorId': '2126799133', 'name': 'Cuauhtémoc Calderón Villarreal'}]"

Subsidizing the Microchip Race: The Expanding Use of National Security Arguments in International Trade,"In 2018, China, India, the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Switzerland, and Turkey lodged complaints with the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) in the case of Certain Measures on Steel and Aluminium Products. Each State alleged that the United States had violated international trade law by imposing a series of aggressive tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. President Donald Trump’s administration responded to these allegations by claiming that its actions were permissible under Article XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT); a long-standing exception built into the international trade law framework that allows States to restrict trade when doing so is vital to their national security. According to the United States, Article XXI granted it and other States near-total discretion when it came to defining their own security interests. The DSB Panel rejected this argument. Instead, the Panel asserted its own power to determine whether a State could claim the protection of Article XXI. When it came to American tariffs on imported metals, the Panel found that Article XXI was not appropriately implicated.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/da9a8d991b0cb1df6aa974c6f4ca61be8dd90fa5,da9a8d991b0cb1df6aa974c6f4ca61be8dd90fa5,"[{'authorId': '2308896281', 'name': 'Victoria Walker'}]"

The amphipods of the genus Hyalella have many endemic species throughout South America, and these may have poorly studied associated species as epibionts. The aim of the present study was to review the literature on the presence of the protozoon Lagenophrys lenticulata (Kellicott, 1885) on species of Hyalella and contrast the results with the geographical distribution of the reported hosts. The literature records the presence of L. lenticulata on populations of H. azteca from Canada, Mexico and the United States of America, and on populations of H. curvispina from Uruguay. The literature also reports that H. curvispina is widespread throughout southern South America, including Argentina and Chile, and that it would be possible to find the presence of epibionts on other populations of H. curvispina.

Modelling COVID-19 in the North American region with a metapopulation network and Kalman filter,"Background: Metapopulation models provide platforms for understanding infectious disease dynamics and predicting clinical outcomes across interconnected populations, particularly for large epidemics and pandemics like COVID-19. Methods: We developed a novel metapopulation model for simulating respiratory virus transmission in the North America region, specifically for the 96 states, provinces, and territories of Canada, Mexico and the United States. The model is informed by COVID-19 case data, which are assimilated using the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF), a Bayesian inference algorithm, and commuting and mobility data, which are used to build and adjust the network and movement across locations on a daily basis. Findings: This model-inference system provides estimates of transmission dynamics, infection rates, and ascertainment rates for each of the 96 locations from January 2020 to March 2021. The results highlight differences in disease dynamics and ascertainment among the three countries. Interpretation: The metapopulation structure enables rapid simulation at large scale, and the data assimilation method makes the system responsive to changes in system dynamics. This model can serve as a versatile platform for modeling other infectious diseases across the North American region.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/100209a8899e9ca78ef495eb48fb2b3d86b86f37,100209a8899e9ca78ef495eb48fb2b3d86b86f37,"[{'authorId': '2302412914', 'name': 'M.

La tuba sinaloense en la renovación de la música regional mexicana del siglo XXI,"This article reflects on the importance of tuba on banda and Mexican regional music, under the actual expansion of tuba and accordion bands. This approach retrieves documental sources and notes of participant observation about musicians of bands and conjuntos in Tijuana. In contrast to other studies concerning banda music groups in Mexico, the present work highlights the musical exchanges to and from the United States as catalysts for the technical development of the instrument and its adoption in popular bands. This vision brings a cross-border approach to the studies on the development of banda and conjunto in both sides of the border. In conclusion, it also highlights the importance of tuba for the contemporary Mexican regional music, which was integrated to the transnational music industry as a part of subaltern musical manifestation.

Nowhere Else to Go: Housing Insecurity in a Hispanic‐Majority Rural County During the COVID‐19 Pandemic☆,"Northern New Mexico was uniquely vulnerable to the COVID‐19 pandemic and its fallout. Its Hispanic majority, aging population, and decreased access to healthcare put many of the communities in this area of the United States at risk. Taos County was particularly at increased risk of impact from COVID‐19. The county was also more vulnerable to the economic consequences of a pandemic due to reliance on tourism; this meant major impacts for individual households. As unemployment and poverty increased—and pandemic relief program rollouts floundered—the consequences meant precarity for many families. One of the most visible impacts of the pandemic was the inability to access affordable housing. This paper, based on 58 in‐depth interviews and 5 months of participant observation, explores experiences of homelessness and housing insecurity among an already vulnerable population during the pandemic, illustrating the ways in which many people struggled. Importantly, this paper explores differences in patterns of housing insecurity among rural White and rural Hispanic participants during the COVID‐19 pandemic. In addition, this paper advocates the importance of looking at nuanced patterns of dealing with housing precarity in the rural setting as the ways in which different populations cope impact the forms of help that are needed when housing becomes a problem.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46f496421c5dc8d53d0b262eb32fa798a45be4bb,46f496421c5dc8d53d0b262eb32fa798a45be4bb,"[{'authorId': '2282038647', 'name': 'Morgan Montañez'}]"
Harmonization of individual case safety reports transmission requirements among PAHO reference authorities: a review of their current regulation,"To perform optimal monitoring of the safety profile in the postmarketing phase, Marketing Authorization Holders and National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) must evaluate the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that occurred and characterize their nature, frequency, and severity. Management is possible through Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs), which are the reports of organized and processed data. Globally, the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E2B guideline suggests harmonized activities for the ICSR electronic content and transmission. In America, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is the agency responsible to implement cooperation among its members, which are recognized as National Regulatory Authorities of Reference (NRARs) such as Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, and the United States. PAHO published the ‘Good Pharmacovigilance Practices for the Americas’ suggesting improvement and harmonization in the region. After reviewing the regulatory framework, it is assumed that all NRARs have a regulated ICSR transmission system (i.e. a systematic vigilance system for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information from ADRs). However, significant differences exist, such as the requirement for social media vigilance, expedited and non-expedited ICSRs, coding, severity, and transmission. The volume of ICSRs has significantly increased, due to using electronic standards managed by the NRAs, which facilitates early identification of new ADRs, allowing the implementation of novel minimization activities, contributing to the continuous assessment of the benefit-risk balance of medicines. Nevertheless, there is still area for improvement, especially in Latin America.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b48a538409797c38f67c5df4851a8bf1e562febb,b48a538409797c38f67c5df4851a8bf1e562febb,"[{'authorId': '2283030300', 'name': 'Antonio Lomeli-Silva'}, {'authorId': '1423343647', 'name': 'Homero Contreras-Salinas'}, {'authorId': '2190894313', 'name': 'Mayra Yolanda Barajas-Virgen'}, {'authorId': '2190894828', 'name': 'Maria Soledad Romero-Lopez'}, {'authorId': '2041929834', 'name': 'Lourdes Yolotzin Rodríguez-Herrera'}]"
Gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) post-mortem findings from December 2018 through 2021 during the Unusual Mortality Event in the Eastern North Pacific,"Beginning in December 2018, increased numbers of gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) strandings were reported along the west coast of Mexico, the United States, and Canada, prompting declaration of a gray whale Unusual Mortality Event (UME) by the United States National Marine Fisheries Service. Although strandings declined in 2020 and 2021 from a peak in 2019, the UME is still ongoing as of fall 2023. Between 17 December 2018 and 31 December 2021, 503 animals stranded along the west coast of North America, with 226 strandings in Mexico, 71 in California, 12 in Oregon, 56 in Washington, 21 in British Columbia, and 117 in Alaska. These included 187 males, 167 females, and 149 whales of undetermined sex; and 193 adults, 194 subadults, 40 calves, 1 fetus, and 75 whales of undetermined age class. We report on 61 of the 503 carcasses (12%) that had external and internal gross necropsy and/or histopathology data: of these 61 whales, findings that contributed to death were identified in 33 (54%) whales. Sixteen of the 61 (26%) were severely emaciated. Gross lesions of blunt force trauma consistent with vessel strike were identified in 11 of the 61 animals (18%), only two of which were emaciated. Two whales (3%) were entangled at time of death, and one died from entrapment. Signs of killer whale (Orcinus orca) interaction were documented in 19 of the 61 animals; five were deemed from recent interactions and three (5%) likely contributed to mortality. A specific cause of death could not be identified in 28 of 61 whales (46%). Additionally, logistical challenges and the advanced state of decomposition of most examined carcasses precluded detection of potential infectious or toxic causes of morbidity or mortality. Up to 2016, the eastern North Pacific population of gray whale population had generally been increasing since the cessation of historic whaling and a prior UME in 1999–2000. However, recent abundance and calf production estimates have declined, a trend that overlaps the current UME. The relative contributions of carrying capacity, environmental change, prey shifts, and infectious, toxic, and other processes to the increased gray whale mortalities have not yet been resolved. Nevertheless, the marked temporal increase in strandings, including findings of malnutrition in some of the whales, along with low calf production, likely represent consequences of complex and dynamic ecological interactions in the ocean impacting the population.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8ac0e11535f4b9e475f6980f66ed04e4428eb3de,8ac0e11535f4b9e475f6980f66ed04e4428eb3de,"[{'authorId': '2275158970', 'name': 'Stephen Raverty'}, {'authorId': '2293683056', 'name': 'Pa´draig Duignan'}, {'authorId': '2293670800', 'name': 'Denise Greig'}, {'authorId': '35584507', 'name': 'J.

Reserving the right to say no? Equilibria around hard trade‐sustainability commitments in power‐asymmetric contexts,"When will stringent sustainability commitments (not) be a stumbling block in the negotiation of trade agreements? Although the existing literature has explored the determinants of the design of sustainability provisions in trade agreements, few works have explored when countries will accept/reject those provisions once their content cannot be changed. Based on insights from game theory, we flesh out the conditions under which there will be an equilibrium in favor of hard sustainability provisions in trade deals. We then present empirical illustrations related to Mexico's participation in the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) and Brazil's participation in the EU‐Mercosur trade negotiations. Our model shows that (1) fears of partner opportunism, (2) the costs of nonparticipation in trade deals, and (3) costs of adjustments to hard trade‐sustainability commitments are key to understanding whether a compromise can arise on trade and strong sustainability commitments. The model highlights what sorts of concessions ought to be made for negotiations to prosper. The findings point to how the changing structure of trade governance may affect the decision‐making process of Global South countries.

"Screen time, social media use, and weight-related bullying victimization: Findings from an international sample of adolescents","Screen time, social media, and weight-related bullying are ubiquitous among adolescents. However, little research has been conducted among international samples. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the association between screen time, social media use, and weight-related bullying victimization among an international sample of adolescents from six countries. Data from the 2020 International Food Policy Study Youth Survey were analyzed (N = 12,031). Multiple modified Poisson regression models were estimated to determine the associations between weekday hours of five forms of screen time, and total screen time, and use of six contemporary social media platforms and weight-related bullying victimization. Analyses were conducted among the overall sample, and stratified by country (Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States). Greater hours of weekday screen time and use of each of the six social media platforms were associated with weight-related bullying victimization among the sample. Each additional hour of social media use was equivalent to a 13% (confidence interval [CI] 1.10–1.16) increase in the prevalence of weight-related bullying victimization. The use of Twitter was associated with a 69% (CI 1.53–1.84) increase in the prevalence of weight-related bullying victimization.

Natural History of the Lace Bug Dictyla labeculata (Uhler) (Hemiptera: Tingidae) and First Confirmed Host Plant Record,"Abstract. The lace bug Dictyla labeculata (Uhler) was described in 1893 from the dry desert of southeastern California's Argus Mountains based on specimens taken on singleleaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla Torr. and Frém.). Subsequent records of this seldom-collected species have been mostly from arid regions of western North America (British Columbia south to Arizona and New Mexico), except for a biogeographically incongruous record from Quebec, Canada. Nebraska is a new state record and the easternmost in the United States based on nymphs and adults found on reproductive structures of James's cryptantha (Cryptantha cinerea [Greene] Cronquist var. jamesii [Torr.] Cronquist) in the Sandhills (June and July, 2020–2022). Idaho is a new state record based on a specimen in the U.S. National Museum of Natural History. The Nebraska study provides the first host plant record for the lace bug. Collections of adults from other plants, such as singleleaf pinyon, are considered incidental or overwintering occurrences. A search for details of the lace bug's collection in Quebec, published without comment in a list of Tingidae from the province, revealed that neither a misidentification nor mislabeling was involved and that the record, albeit anomalous, probably is valid. Because P. R. Uhler did not mention certain details in describing the new species, the collector's name (Albert Koebele) and collection site within the Argus Range (Maturango Spring) are provided. Insect collecting as part of the Death Valley Expedition of 1893 to the western states, during which the lace bug and numerous other new species were discovered, is noted.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ec10084e0a06d81b82c5beb2f419b9676ef81d48,ec10084e0a06d81b82c5beb2f419b9676ef81d48,"[{'authorId': '2282818737', 'name': 'Wheeler A.

Logistic oscillator model for gross domestic product,"In this paper, a logistic oscillator model is presented to analyze the economic cycles of five selected economies: Mexico, Brazil, Canada, China and the United States. This selection was made taking as reference their level of economic development and their geographical position. The proposed model is an extension of the production Phillip’s model (1959), which considers autonomous expenses dependent on time. It should be noted that the logistic oscillator combines the dynamics of a forced damped oscillator, whose restoring force incorporates Verhulst’s logistic equation. The data used are the production levels of The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) at nominal prices of the mentioned nations. The results obtained show terms of no economic damping with explosive tendency. China shows greater nondamping with an explosive trend, as does Mexico. The countries with the greatest oscillatory behavior are Brazil and Canada. Additionally, those showing exponential dynamics are China and the USA. The fitting of the logistic oscillator to the data is significant given the level of the determination coefficient. Therefore, the results indicate that the model can be useful in formulating economic policy criteria, since it allows one to predict the evolution of the economic cycle in the future.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/316455b62060461e896beab7f709ea2de97d4e83,316455b62060461e896beab7f709ea2de97d4e83,"[{'authorId': '2277918590', 'name': 'E.

"THE ALLOKOTOSAUR (REPTILIA: ARCHOSAUROMORPHA) ASSEMBLAGE FROM A MULTITAXIC BONEBED IN THE SONSELA MEMBER (JIM CAMP WASH BEDS, CHINLE FORMATION) AT PETRIFIED FOREST NATIONAL PARK, U.S.A.","Allokotosaurian archosauromorphs (i.e., trilophosaurids and azen-dohsaurids) are known from Middle Triassic to Upper Triassic terrestrial deposits in Madagascar, Morocco, India, the United Kingdom, southeastern Canada, and the southwestern United States. In western Texas, trilophosaurids and malerisaurine azen-dohsaurids co-occur in Otischalkian sites, but numerous sites in the Chinle Forma-tion-Dockum Group depobasin of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona preserve either trilophosaurids or malerisaurines, blurring our understanding of the evolution of these groups and their potential biostratigraphic utility. Here we report an allokotosaurian assemblage from PFV 410 (the Kaye Quarry), a lowermost Revueltian locality in the upper Sonsela Member of the Chinle Formation at Petrified Forest National Park that preserves both trilophosaurid and malerisaurine azendohsaurid taxa, which indicates that these lineages may have co-occurred in the southwestern United States for ~10 million years during the Carnian to Norian. This locality is important because it pre-serves teeth of Trilophosaurus phasmalophos in a maxilla that may help resolve taxo-nomic uncertainty in that genus, and it shows that malerisaurines persisted at least for some time after the hypothesized Adamanian-Revueltian biotic turnover.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f6e1db762370687f3290543c1f2eba8afd07cfc4,f6e1db762370687f3290543c1f2eba8afd07cfc4,"[{'authorId': '38388306', 'name': 'A.

Why Do (High-Income) Countries Wish to Green Their Trade Agreements?,"In recent years, many states have undertaken to green their free trade agreements (FTA). As the pace of this evolution towards greener trade relations continues to accelerate, it has also been met with resistance. The inclusion of environmental commitments in FTAs has sometimes been dismissed as an attempt by high-income countries to level the playing field for their market actors by raising environmental standards abroad. Against this background, this article aims to investigate what underlying motive(s) (high-income) states pursue when they negotiate environmental provisions. Using the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) as a case study, it is argued that it is possible to rely on the legalization of these commitments to unravel treaty parties’ motives for negotiating such rules in the first place. In the case of the USMCA, it is found that the agreement’s environmental commitments could be interpreted as mirroring concern either for the environment or for unfair foreign competition. A closer look at the negotiation process leading to the adoption of the agreement suggests that it was mainly – although certainly not exclusively – out of environmental concerns that stringent environmental commitments were included in the USMCA.

Article: Harmonization of FTA Rules of Origin: Examination of General Provisions,"
 This paper explores whether rules of origin (ROOs) of free-trade agreements (FTAs) are on a path to convergence or divergence. It identifies three major ROOs templates associated with the United States (US), the European Union (EU), and the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The study reveals a growing divergence in the general provisions of these templates, with the EU’s template growing more flexible through the introduction of lenient tolerance rules in its FTAs, and the North American template becoming more restrictive, as exemplified by the Net Cost (NC) method and the core-parts rule for automotive products in the ROOs of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Furthermore, the study reveals that the ROOs of the cross-template FTAs that include parties associated with distinct templates adopt the template of the larger economic participant. These cross-template FTAs also introduce novel variations in their general provisions such as the focused-value (FV) method of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The alignment of cross-template FTAs with the major ROOs templates and the introduction of novel variations in cross-template FTAs pose challenges to the global harmonization of FTA ROOs.

"EclipseNB: A Radio Instrument Network for Monitoring the Ionosphere During the April 8, 2024 Total Solar Eclipse","On April 8, 2024 there will be a total solar eclipse spanning Mexico, Central-East United States, and Eastern Canada. A total solar eclipse has a dramatic effect on the structure, dynamic behaviour, and coupling of the Earth's atmosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere (AIM) system, and presents a unique opportunity to study the physics and chemistry at play during a sudden and localized reduction in solar radiation. As demonstrated in studies of previous eclipse events such as the August 2017 “Great American Eclipse”, there remains several outstanding questions pertaining to the complex physical processes that occur within the AIM environment during a solar eclipse. Addressing many of these open issues requires enhanced observational capabilities, including high spatial and temporal resolution observations of the ionosphere during a solar eclipse. To monitor the ionosphere over Eastern Canada during the April 2024 event, we are in the process of installing 49 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, including 30 high-rate scintillation monitors, as well as 3 ionosonde systems. This radio remote-sensing network will be located within and adjacent to the path of totality, and is designed to observe the multi-scale (sub-km to 100s of kms) structuring of the ionosphere during the eclipse event. We will discuss the details of the EclipseNB network and the potential applications of these observations.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6fedc94fd1ff93c40d59ae470f674ec35c1073c3,6fedc94fd1ff93c40d59ae470f674ec35c1073c3,"[{'authorId': '2269174340', 'name': 'Chris Watson'}, {'authorId': '2269320991', 'name': 'A.

Efectos del crecimiento económico en las emisiones de CO2 en América del Norte,"This paper examines the heterogeneity in the environmental field, specifically in the emission of the main of the greenhouse gases, CO2, within the 3 countries composing the North American region. On the one hand, the United States is a large emitter of CO2 (19% of global emissions accumulated in 1990-2020), only surpassed by China as of 2005. On the other hand, Canada and Mexico are relatively small emitters on a global scale (1.8% and 1.4% of global emissions accumulated in 1990-2020, respectively), but with large economic and technological differences. Under these conditions, the objective of this research is to find differences and similarities between the three countries regarding CO2 emissions trends and their driving structural factors: scale, technological and composition effects, based on annual data from 2001 to 2014. With a structural decomposition analysis, we found that, in general, the scale effect was polluting and dominating in the period, while the technological effect was anti-polluting, in addition to a small and ambivalent composition effect (positive in some years and negative in others). It is concluded that there is a process of convergence in the intensity of emissions per GDP value and with respect to the three mentioned effects. It is also concluded that the characteristics of the three effects in Mexico were like those of the United States, while Canada approached along the analysis period.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e0df39e6bfae6fa5f1ec7a6dfc25c4470604bd2,0e0df39e6bfae6fa5f1ec7a6dfc25c4470604bd2,"[{'authorId': '2136714168', 'name': 'David Mendoza Tinoco'}, {'authorId': '2126906432', 'name': 'Lilian Albornoz Mendoza'}, {'authorId': '2126623027', 'name': 'Alfonso Mercado García'}]"
Causes of the salary levels in the Mexican automotive industry three years after the USMCA,"The United States, Mexico, and Canada (USMCA) seek to promote fair wages and adequate working conditions, especially in Mexico, by strengthening labor rights and freedom of association. The objective of this research is to determine the factors that influence salary levels in the Mexican Automotive Industry (MAI), through a causality analysis in the Granger sense, to generate a panorama that allows a decision-making process in the Mexican salary policy. With data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the Bank of Mexico and Statista, autoregressive vector models were estimated to determine causalities in the Granger sense. It was proven that minimum wage, employed personnel, production, total sales, and exports are some causes of remuneration in the sector, with the minimum wage being the most significant. The above suggests that the salary increase involves several actors, such as the government (minimum wage), the organization (production, sales and exports) and the market (employed personnel), therefore, the design of appropriate labor policies will contribute to the dignification of salaries inside the MAI.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af4c582ac8b0ac9d7711100140f15ae77b0496da,af4c582ac8b0ac9d7711100140f15ae77b0496da,"[{'authorId': '2080812340', 'name': 'Cesaire Chiatchoua'}, {'authorId': '2164832169', 'name': 'Carlos Ernesto Luquez Gaitan'}, {'authorId': '2307850742', 'name': 'Ernest Yasser Nuñez Betancourt'}]"
Spanishness and Race in North American Monumental Architecture,"The representation of Spain, and Spanishness in general, at sites of collective identity in the United States and Canada requires scholarly attention. Many monuments, which range from statues and museums to capitol buildings and national parks, continue to commemorate colonial times despite broader public awareness of the association between colonization and racialized violence, as well as the explicit movement toward decolonization. This commemorative material also demonstrates how non-Spanish settlers have appropriated historical moorings of Spain and its colonial past to reinforce and whitewash their identities in places such as New Mexico and Texas, and even in Newfoundland and Labrador. How monuments are funded and gain public support is another vector that points to the ways that identity—particularly, white identity—informs monumental architecture in ways that exclude people of colour, as well as women, who, when featured in monuments, are usually dehumanized as concepts rather than being the actors of settler-colonialism.

Iva frutescens typically occurs in the upper tidal ecotone of salt marshes with more terrestrial upland vegetation. Marsh elder is a hardy shrub that is relatively intolerant to flooding but has a relative tolerance to low soil salinity. Iva frutescens recovers quickly after cutting and fire and may be important in blocking the invasion of Phragmites australis into reconstructed salt marshes. Borrichia frutescens and I. frutescens are associated with the phenomenon of associational resistance.

NAFTA: MORE THAN A REGIONAL TRADE AGREEMENT,"Trade is one of the fundamental reasons underlying the relationships between societies. Commercial interactions have contributed to the establishment of a specific international system worldwide through the trade relations between empires and states. In the 20th century, interstate trade led to the formation of certain agreements, some of which gave rise to regional-scale trade alliances. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is one of the regional trade agreements documented among North American countries, holding significant importance not only in increasing trade volume among signatory nations but also in terms of fostering regional cooperation and closer political relations.

Despite being criticized by many since its signing date, NAFTA underwent substantial changes in 2020 and was restructured under the name The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Despite controversies and criticisms, NAFTA played a significant role in strengthening regional economic, social, and political ties, becoming one of the prominent examples of the rising regional trade agreements worldwide after the 1990s. In this study, the motivation behind NAFTA's inception, its historical development, member countries, and the positive impacts on the region are discussed. The contributions of NAFTA to the North American economy and regional development are examined through the analysis of gathered data, reports, and academic studies.

Santa Claus is coming!,"This research delves into the ""seasonal fixed bonus"" phenomenon in Mexico, Spain, the United States, and Canada, examining how employees prefer receiving payments during the Christmas season or evenly distributed throughout the year. Two hypotheses explore biases arising from bounded rationality: Hypothesis 1 suggests Mexican/Spanish workers may resist receiving the bonus dispersed throughout the year, while Hypothesis 2 posits American/Canadian workers may resist a reduction in monthly payments for a seasonal bonus. Using a utopic international competition, the study reveals that Mexican/Spanish participants exhibit a preference for end-of-year rewards, partially supporting Hypothesis 1, whereas American/Canadian participants lean towards immediate rewards, partially supporting Hypothesis 2. Statistical significance is found in Mexico and Spain, aligning with mental accounting principles, while the U.S. and Canada show similar trends but lack significance. This implies a potential status quo bias among American and Canadian workers regarding seasonal bonuses.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af606f755360d56409ae4cf98bdd8a6ab166cc53,af606f755360d56409ae4cf98bdd8a6ab166cc53,"[{'authorId': '2297904107', 'name': 'Mauricio Andres Correa Herrejon'}]"
Twitch spouse: Livestreaming and the legacy of spousal labour in the video game industry,"Precarious careers in the games industry have long relied on the unpaid and largely feminized support of spouses and family members. This paper addresses the role of spouses and other domestic cohabitants in the production of live game broadcasts on Twitch, Amazon’s world-leading platform in live video entertainment. I introduce the heuristic of the ‘Twitch Spouse’ to underscore the crucial role that domestic partners have played as invisible workers in the wider games industry, whose precarious conditions have been extended by the rise of at-home livestreaming. Drawing from ‘playful’ interviews and ethnographic observation with 12 Twitch creators located across the United States and Canada, I delineate three themes by which the partners of Twitch streamers vitally contribute to livestreaming: collaborative space production, the management of intimacy, and timekeeping. Herein, I show how a theorization of the ‘Twitch Spouse’ will build future pathways for recognizing the intertwined struggles of domestic and digital work within the precarious horizons of the game industry. This paper argues that Twitch streamers’ conceptualizations of intimate partners’ supportive labour reinforce domesticity and visibility as co-extended forces in the evolving relevance of digital labour to contemporary capitalism.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/377f450a52370f6ecb0b19fb2873839d09c6f79c,377f450a52370f6ecb0b19fb2873839d09c6f79c,"[{'authorId': '2134516552', 'name': 'Christine H.

"High Spatial Resolution in Total Water Storage Variations Inferred From GPS: Case Study in the Great Lakes Watershed, US","Assessing spatiotemporal water storage variability in the Great Lakes Watershed (GLW) is critical given its transboundary status impacting both Canada and the United States. Here, we apply a novel inversion strategy to global positioning system (GPS) vertical movements to achieve high spatial resolution total water storage (TWS) variations in GLW through improved processing. The steps are composed of removing load changes driven by the lake water fluctuation by forward modeling, isolating the Great Lakes grids to solve the ill‐conditioned problem in inversion, and inverting the GPS residual series to estimate TWS variations on land (TWSGPS). The results show that the regional dense continuous GPS observation network can successfully resolve TWS on land at monthly timescales with 30–45 km spatial resolution. We also could effectively capture fine‐scale TWS features than GRACE/GFO mascon products. GRACE/GFO satellites largely underestimate seasonal and long‐term TWS spatial fluctuations, but their temporal patterns coincide with those from GPS. The average annual amplitude of TWSGPS on land reaches 82.0 mm, greatly exceeding estimates from GRACE/GFO (∼48.0 mm) and composite hydrological model outputs (∼62.0 mm). The seasonal groundwater fluctuations inferred from GPS have peak‐to‐peak amplitudes of ∼40 km3 with the maximum around September. This coincides with that from GRACE/GFO. However, the magnitudes and phases of groundwater storage from GPS vary markedly among the subbasins in GLW, and the different snow and soil moisture amounts measured in each subbasin cause discrepancies among these GPS estimates. This study shows the value of GPS data in spatially downscaling GRACE/GFO data and providing high‐resolution output at spatiotemporal scales with low latency.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/856d8c596dab2ad29d95d67e71c866c3a7ee6982,856d8c596dab2ad29d95d67e71c866c3a7ee6982,"[{'authorId': '2308098634', 'name': 'Shuo Zheng'}, {'authorId': '2307765003', 'name': 'Zizhan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2258766220', 'name': 'Bridget R.

"Historical meteorological droughts over the CORDEX‐CAM (Central America, Caribbean and Mexico) domain: Evaluating the simulation of dry hot spots with RegCM4","Historical meteorological droughts are analysed over the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment‐Central America, Caribbean and Mexico (CORDEX‐CAM) domain during 1981–2010, with particular emphasis on the North American monsoon (NAM) and the mid‐summer drought (MSD) regions. We analyse droughts based on the standardized precipitation index (SPI‐12) and the standardized precipitation‐evapotranspiration index (SPEI‐12) using observations from CRU, CHIRPS, GPCP and ERA5‐Land reanalysis (ERA5), and assess the skill of the regional climate model RegCM4 (version 7) at 25 km resolution driven by ERA‐Interim (Reg‐ERA) and by three global climate models (Reg‐GCMs: Reg‐Had, Reg‐MPI and Reg‐GFDL). Observational data sets show large spatial variations in drought frequency, and both Reg‐ERA and Reg‐GCMs have difficulties simulating it. RegCM4 shows positive precipitation and water balance biases over mountain regions and negative ones over Central America, possibly due to the complex terrain and poor observational data coverage. Despite differences among observations, the trend in droughts, duration and severity show consistent dry hot spots (regions with long‐duration severe droughts) over the western United States, the United States‐Mexico border region, the NAM, the Yucatan Peninsula and northern Central America, with stronger values of SPEI‐12 than SPI‐12, particularly over the subtropical regions. Reg‐ERA and ERA5 show similar spatial patterns and similar positive and negative spatial biases relative to observations. Reg‐ERA and Reg‐Had adequately simulate the spatial patterns of the trend, duration and severity of droughts, with smaller biases in SPI‐12 than SPEI‐12; in contrast, Reg‐MPI and Reg‐GFDL overestimate the trend biases over northwest CAM. Observations, reanalysis, and RegCM4 capture an inverse drought response between the NAM and the MSD regions linked to climate teleconnections; however, a stronger drought signal is observed in the NAM, which appears to be linked to decadal variations from negative to positive phases of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation combined with La Niña conditions (negative El Niño 1+2 phase).",2024,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d29f87c8cec70184113b4f3421df6636f4035694,d29f87c8cec70184113b4f3421df6636f4035694,"[{'authorId': '1460140292', 'name': 'Luisa Andrade‐Gómez'}, {'authorId': '2281551094', 'name': 'Tereza Cavazos'}]"
"Teaching spanish to migrants in the Soconusco region, Chiapas, Mexico","This research was conducted in the state of Chiapas, throughout the Soconusco region. Students from BA in English Language Teaching at UNACH (Universidad Autonoma de Chiapas) participated as teachers in basic Spanish courses for the migrant population, from January 2020 to April 2021. This paper aims to give an account of the partial results of a study; its main objective is to analyze the nature of teaching Spanish to migrants and people in mobility from different countries. Migratory movements are a phenomenon of special incidence in contemporary societies according to the Manifest of Santander (2009), one of the first works carried out in Spain in terms of language teaching to migrants and refugees. Given the need to incorporate the teaching of the target language into the global policies of care for immigrants, since their learning of the target language depends a lot on the active insertion in the host community (Manifest of Santander cited in Garcia et al. 2014). The Language school at the UNACH is a public educational institution with social responsibility that has collaborated with COMAR (Comisión Mexicana de Ayuda a Refugiados) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) seeking to protect the rights and welfare of refugees, migrants and people in mobility during their stay in Mexico. Thus, the Language School has carried out the implementation of teaching basic Spanish courses as a foreign language to refugees and migrants from countries such as Haiti, Surinam, the United States, Jamaica, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, and Canada. However, due to the COVID-19 contingency, these courses were changed from face-to-face sessions to virtual mode during that period and after the contingency, the courses had been taught in face-to-face sessions again.  In this sense, this research yields interesting contributions that can be taken into account for a significant teaching-learning process of Spanish as a foreign language or as a second language in the region of Soconusco answering the following research questions: What is the training of teachers who teach Spanish as a second language in the Soconusco region? What difficulties did they have while teaching Spanish as a second language?

Aspirin vs Placebo as Adjuvant Therapy for Breast Cancer: The Alliance A011502 Randomized Trial.,"Importance
Observational studies of survivors of breast cancer and prospective trials of aspirin for cardiovascular disease suggest improved breast cancer survival among aspirin users, but prospective studies of aspirin to prevent breast cancer recurrence are lacking.


Objective
To determine whether aspirin decreases the risk of invasive cancer events among survivors of breast cancer.


Design, Setting, and Participants
A011502, a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial conducted in the United States and Canada with 3020 participants who had high-risk nonmetastatic breast cancer, enrolled participants from 534 sites from January 6, 2017, through December 4, 2020, with follow-up to March 4, 2023.


Interventions
Participants were randomized (stratified for hormone receptor status [positive vs negative], body mass index [≤30 vs >30], stage II vs III, and time since diagnosis [<18 vs ≥18 months]) to receive 300 mg of aspirin (n = 1510) or placebo once daily (n = 1510) for 5 years.


Main Outcomes and Measures
The primary outcome was invasive disease-free survival. Overall survival was a key secondary outcome.


Results
A total of 3020 participants were randomized when the data and safety monitoring committee recommended suspending the study at the first interim analysis because the hazard ratio had crossed the prespecified futility bound. By median follow-up of 33.8 months (range, 0.1-72.6 months), 253 invasive disease-free survival events were observed (141 in the aspirin group and 112 in the placebo group), yielding a hazard ratio of 1.27 (95% CI, 0.99-1.63; P = .06). All invasive disease-free survival events, including death, invasive progression (both distant and locoregional), and new primary events, were numerically higher in the aspirin group, although the differences were not statistically significant. There was no difference in overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.82-1.72). Rates of grades 3 and 4 adverse events were similar in both groups.


Conclusion and Relevance
Among participants with high-risk nonmetastatic breast cancer, daily aspirin therapy did not improve risk of breast cancer recurrence or survival in early follow-up. Despite its promise and wide availability, aspirin should not be recommended as an adjuvant breast cancer treatment.

Special Observing Period (SOP) data for the Year of Polar Prediction site Model Intercomparison Project (YOPPsiteMIP),"Abstract. The rapid changes occurring in the polar regions require an improved understanding of the processes that are driving these changes. At the same time, increased human activities such as marine navigation, resource exploitation, aviation, commercial fishing, and tourism require reliable and relevant weather information. One of the primary goals of the World Meteorological Organization's Year of Polar Prediction (YOPP) project is to improve the accuracy of numerical weather prediction (NWP) at high latitudes. During YOPP, two Canadian “supersites” were commissioned and equipped with new ground-based instruments for enhanced meteorological and system process observations. Additional pre-existing supersites in Canada, the United States, Norway, Finland, and Russia also provided data from ongoing long-term observing programs. These supersites collected a wealth of observations that are well suited to address YOPP objectives. In order to increase data useability and station interoperability, novel Merged Observatory Data Files (MODFs) were created for the seven supersites over two Special Observing Periods (February to March 2018 and July to September 2018). All observations collected at the supersites were compiled into this standardized NetCDF MODF format, simplifying the process of conducting pan-Arctic NWP verification and process evaluation studies. This paper describes the seven Arctic YOPP supersites, their instrumentation, data collection and processing methods, the novel MODF format, and examples of the observations contained therein. MODFs comprise the observational contribution to the model intercomparison effort, termed YOPP site Model Intercomparison Project (YOPPsiteMIP). All YOPPsiteMIP MODFs are publicly accessible via the YOPP Data Portal (Whitehorse: https://doi.org/10.21343/a33e-j150, Huang et al., 2023a; Iqaluit: https://doi.org/10.21343/yrnf-ck57, Huang et al., 2023b; Sodankylä: https://doi.org/10.21343/m16p-pq17, O'Connor, 2023; Utqiaġvik: https://doi.org/10.21343/a2dx-nq55, Akish and Morris, 2023c; Tiksi: https://doi.org/10.21343/5bwn-w881, Akish and Morris, 2023b; Ny-Ålesund: https://doi.org/10.21343/y89m-6393, Holt, 2023; and Eureka: https://doi.org/10.21343/r85j-tc61, Akish and Morris, 2023a), which is hosted by MET Norway, with corresponding output from NWP models.

Abstract PO1-02-11: Characterization of MammaPrint UltraLow Risk tumors in more than 1400 patients from the real-world evidence FLEX study,"
 BACKGROUND: MammaPrint is a gene expression signature used to determine the risk of distant recurrence for patients with early-stage breast cancer. Previous studies from MINDACT, FOCUS, IKA, and STO-3 trials have demonstrated that postmenopausal node-negative patients with MammaPrint UltraLow Risk tumors are considered indolent and patients have excellent long-term survival outcomes up to 20 years with little to no endocrine treatment. These studies suggest that patients with UltraLow Risk tumors are ideal candidates for treatment optimization which has resulted in the inclusion of the UltraLow Risk result in the NCCN guidelines. Here, we characterized patients with UltraLow Risk tumors from the real-world evidence FLEX study. METHODS: FLEX (NCT03053193) is a prospective, observational registry study with 99 sites open in the United States, Canada, Greece, and Israel. Patients enrolled in FLEX have early-stage breast cancer and receive MammaPrint testing as standard of care (with or without BluePrint molecular subtyping), and consent to full transcriptome analysis and clinical data collection. MammaPrint is a gene expression signature of 70 genes that classifies tumors as having a Low Risk or High Risk of distant recurrence. Within Low Risk tumors, a subcategory of UltraLow Risk (MammaPrint Index > 0.355) has been defined in previous studies. Clinical data for this analysis was locked February 2023. Clinical risk was defined as low risk or high risk based on Adjuvant Online criteria. RESULTS: Among the 12,328 patients enrolled in FLEX, 1465 (11.9%) have UltraLow Risk tumors. All tumors with available BluePrint molecular subtyping were classified as Luminal-Type. Of the patients with detailed clinical data, the majority had clinically low risk tumors (78.8%; Table 1). Notably, 34.6% of patients with UltraLow Risk tumors had Ki67 tumor staining of greater than 10%, 16.7% were pre- or peri-menopausal, 43.6% had grade 2-3 tumors, and 20.1% had tumors > 2 cm (Table 1). Among patients with treatment information, 6.5% received a combination of chemotherapy with or without endocrine and HER2-targeted therapy, 82.4% received endocrine therapy, 4.8% received other treatment (endocrine with targeted therapy (CDK4/6), radiation alone, novel treatment regimen, or supporting agents), and 6.3% did not receive treatment (Table 1). CONCLUSIONS: Previous trials have demonstrated the utility of MammaPrint UltraLow Risk in patients with clinically low risk features. In this large real-world evidence study of patients with early-stage breast cancer, UltraLow Risk tumors can be identified across all clinical categories. Overall, we report a substantial number of premenopausal patients with UltraLow Risk tumors, and these young women would be good candidates for treatment optimization. Future studies will assess long-term outcomes in this cohort further stratified by treatment.

"A review of the Stelidium group of Stelis Panzer, 1806 (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) with two new species from western North America.","The Stelidium group is readily distinguished from all other members of the subgenus Stelis Panzer, 1806 by the combination of small body size ( 6 mm), pale maculations on the head adjacent to the inner margins of the compound eyes and laterally on the vertex in both sexes, and females with sternum 6 extended beyond tergum 6, the former with the dorsal lip trowel-shaped with the apex broadly rounded or subtruncate to more narrowly pointed. This monophyletic clade, which is endemic to North America, currently consists of members previously placed into two species groups: the permaculata group containing S. anasazi Parker & Griswold, 2013, S. ashmeadiellae Timberlake, 1941, S. permaculata Cockerell, 1898, and S. robertsoni Timberlake, 1941, and the palmarum group containing S. broemelingi Parker & Griswold, 2013, S. elongativentris Parker, 1987, and S. palmarum Timberlake, 1941; two additional species, S. herberti (Cockerell, 1916) from Mexico, and S. nyssonoides (Brues, 1903) from Texas, United States, have not been definitively placed in either species group. Two new species are herein described, one from southcentral British Columbia, Canada, the other from New Mexico, United States. A preliminary molecular phylogeny places both new species in the permaculata species group. In addition, S. herberti is also placed within the permaculata species group based on morphological similarity, sharing the multi-spotted maculation pattern on the terga. Based on molecular affinity, S. broemelingi also belongs to the permaculata species group. Because no type specimen for S. nyssonoides is seemingly available for examination, it is hereby considered nomen dubium until the specimen is found and its taxonomic status clarified in relation to the more recently described species in the permaculata species group.

In evaluating the climate impact of production, the carbon intensity (CI, the ratio of greenhouse gases emitted compared to the energy of fuels produced) is often used, though it is rarely quantified with measurements. Here, we complete an observational evaluation of the US offshore sector and present the largest current set of measurement-based CIs. We collected airborne measurements of methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides from the North Slope, Cook Inlet, and California and combined with prior GOM results. For Alaska and California, we found emissions agree with facility-level inventories, however, the inventories miss some facilities. The US offshore CI, on a 100 year GWP basis, is 5.7 g CO2e/MJ[4.5, 6.8, 95% confidence interval]. This is greater than double the CI based on the national US inventory, with the discrepancy attributed primarily to methane emissions from GOM shallow waters, with a methane dominated CI of 16[12, 22] for GOM federal shallow waters and 43[25–65] for state shallow waters. Regional intensities vary, with carbon dioxide emissions largely responsible for CI on the North Slope 11[7.5, 15], in Cook Inlet 22[13, 34], offshore California 7.2[3.2, 13], and in GOM deep waters 1.1[1.0, 1.1]. These observations indicate offshore operations outside of the GOM in the US have modest methane emissions, but the CI can still be elevated due to direct carbon dioxide emissions. Accurate assessment of different offshore basins, with differing characteristics and practices, is important for the climate considerations of expanded production.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/added687a915bf0c3a09976b810feeb7df8e4925,added687a915bf0c3a09976b810feeb7df8e4925,"[{'authorId': '51196225', 'name': 'Alan M.

Cross-Sectional Quantitative Evaluation of a Novel Patient-Reported Outcome Measure in Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome,"Background Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) is a rare metabolic disorder that impacts physical, emotional, social, and cognitive functioning. The FCS-Symptom and Impact Scale (FCS-SIS) patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure assesses common symptoms and impacts of FCS. This study was conducted to evaluate cross-sectional psychometric properties of the FCS-SIS and its scoring method. Methods This multisite, cross-sectional, observational study of individuals with FCS was conducted in the United States and Canada. Participants completed a survey composed of 7 PRO measures, including the FCS-SIS, and questions about clinical characteristics and demographics. The structure of the FCS-SIS was evaluated using inter-item and item-scale correlations and internal consistency reliability. Construct, known-groups, and criterion validity were evaluated by examining associations between FCS-SIS item and composite scores and other measures included within the survey. Results Most of the 33 participants were female (63.6%) and White (78.1%). On average, participants reported first noticing FCS symptoms at ~16 years, with abdominal pain the most frequently reported initial symptom (n=20). Participants reported 2.5 acute pancreatitis attacks on average over the past year. Average FCS-SIS symptom item scores ranged from 1.8 to 3.9 (on a 0-to-10 scale [none-to-worst-possible]) within the 24-hour recall period, with an average Symptom composite score of 2.7. The average impact item scores on the FCS-SIS ranged from 1.6 to 3.0 (on a 0-to-4 scale), with an average Impact composite score of 2.1. Inter-item correlations between the FCS-SIS Symptom items ranged from 0.32 to 0.78. Corrected item-total correlations were highly satisfactory for Impact items, ranging from 0.62 to 0.85. All a priori validity hypotheses were supported by observed correlations and score differences between known groups. Conclusion The results of this study support the structure, reliability, and validity of the FCS-SIS, laying the psychometric groundwork for longitudinal evaluation of its utility in assessing treatment benefit in FCS clinical studies.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/624c7378852d0965ff3c8027c9338ba4b54b22fb,624c7378852d0965ff3c8027c9338ba4b54b22fb,"[{'authorId': '2284932539', 'name': 'Michelle Brown'}, {'authorId': '2270929116', 'name': 'Montserrat Vera-Llonch'}, {'authorId': '2284408401', 'name': 'Chisom Kanu'}, {'authorId': '5217006', 'name': 'A.

A critical appraisal of water table depth estimation: Challenges and opportunities within machine learning,"Fine-resolution spatial patterns of water table depth (WTD) play a crucial role in shaping ecological resilience, hydrological connectivity, and anthropocentric objectives. Generally, a large-scale (e.g., continental or global) spatial map of static WTD can be simulated using either physically-based (PB) or machine learning-based (ML) models. We construct three fine-resolution (500 m) ML simulations of WTD, using the XGBoost algorithm and more than 20 million real and proxy observations of WTD, across the United States and Canada. The three ML models were constrained using known physical relations between WTD's drivers and WTD and were trained by sequentially adding real and proxy observations of WTD. We interpret the black box of our physically constrained ML models and compare it against available literature in groundwater hydrology. Through an extensive (pixel-by-pixel) evaluation, we demonstrate that our models can more accurately predict unseen real and proxy observations of WTD across most of North America's ecoregions compared to three available PB simulations of WTD. However, we still argue that large-scale WTD estimation is far from being a solved problem. We reason that due to biased observational data mainly collected from low-elevation floodplains, the misspecification of equations within physically-based models, and the over-flexibility of machine learning models, verifiably accurate simulations of WTD do not yet exist. Ultimately, we thoroughly discuss future directions that may help hydrogeologists decide how to proceed with WTD estimations, with a particular focus on the application of machine learning and the use of proxy satellite data.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b72cb4dae238e4e945283cf9d3de2b149c97d882,b72cb4dae238e4e945283cf9d3de2b149c97d882,"[{'authorId': '2300207190', 'name': 'Joseph Janssen'}, {'authorId': '74593102', 'name': 'A.

498 - Real-world use and effectiveness of upadacitinib in adults and adolescents with atopic dermatitis: preliminary analysis of the real-world multicountry AD-VISE study,"
 
 
 Upadacitinib (UPA) 15 and 30 mg once daily is approved for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in several jurisdictions, including the European Union, Japan, Canada, and the United States, with indication/posology differences. Clinical studies have documented the safety and efficacy of UPA; however, real-world data on UPA are limited. The AD-VISE study objective is to characterize the real-world utilization patterns and effectiveness of UPA 15 and 30 mg in adults and adolescents with AD in clinical practice.
 
 
 
 AD-VISE is an ongoing observational, prospective, multicountry study to assess the use of UPA in routine clinical practice for 2 years. Adult and adolescent patients (pts) receiving UPA for AD are being enrolled. Primary effectiveness outcome measures included validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) 0/1 at month 4. Other outcome measures included Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Worst Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (WP-NRS), and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). This interim analysis (data cutoff February 27, 2023) reports baseline data and 2- and 4-month effectiveness data. Effectiveness analyses included pts that were enrolled at least 4 months by the data cutoff date or discontinued from the study; non-responder imputation with multiple imputation (NRI-MI) was used.
 
 
 
 Baseline analyses included 267 pts, of whom 21 (7.9%) were adolescents; effectiveness analyses included 209 patients (NRI-MI). Overall, 155 (58.1%) pts started on UPA 15 mg and 112 (41.9%) started on UPA 30 mg. Most pts in this analysis were from Canada (56.2%), followed by Russia (10.9%) and Australia (8.6%). Mean (SD) UPA exposure was 218.8 (±117.6) days; 5.6% of pts discontinued UPA and 3.7% discontinued the study. The most common reason for starting on UPA 15 mg was attempting lowest possible effective dose (42.9%) and on 30 mg, high disease burden/severity of skin symptoms (35.2%). More pts starting UPA 30 mg vs 15 mg were between 18 to <65 years old (96.4% vs 76.1%), male (61.6% vs 51.0%), had severe AD (vIGA-AD score 4: 53.6% vs 46.3%), had prurigo nodules (30.6% vs 18.4%), asthma (45.5% vs 24.5%), and prior biologic systemic therapy use (16.1% vs 10.3%) . More than half of the pts (51.2%) achieved vIGA-AD 0/1 at month 2, and this proportion increased to 61.3% at month 4. Similarly, rate of achieving EASI 90 (month 2: 46.9%; month 4: 57.2%) and DLQI 0/1 (month 2: 35.1%; month 4: 41.3%) increased, whereas rates were maintained for ≥4-point WP-NRS improvement (month 2: 68.1%; month 4: 69.3%). Similar results were observed with other endpoints.
 
 
 
 Initial findings from the AD-VISE study, the largest study to report multicountry real-world data on UPA treatment patterns and effectiveness in AD, suggest that most pts achieved clear/almost clear skin and clinically meaningful itch improvement by month 4. Because this is a real-world observational study, it was expected that physicians start with UPA dose per local label. The main reason for starting UPA 30 mg was high disease burden/severity of skin symptoms, whereas 15 mg was started to attempt the lowest possible effective dose. More pts starting UPA 30 mg vs 15 mg were adults, male, and had prior biologic systemic therapy use.

Multi‐locus sequence typing indicates multiple strains of Mycoplasma in desert bighorn sheep and aoudad in Texas,"Epizootic events of pneumonia, presumably caused by Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) have been observed in the western United States and Canada. Until recently, it was thought that populations of Mexican (O. c. mexicana) and Nelson's (O. c. nelsoni) desert bighorn sheep in Texas, USA, had not been exposed to Mycoplasma. Evidence of disease and potential population decline from outbreaks of M. ovipneumoniae are now known from several populations across the Trans‐Pecos Ecoregion with documented instances of pneumonia and bluetongue in desert bighorn sheep from the Van Horn Mountains and Black Gap Wildlife Management Area. These disease events, especially those in 2019–2021, may be a result of increasing populations of aoudad (Ammotragus lervia), an introduced and invasive ungulate, in the region. With large population sizes and similar movement patterns as desert bighorn sheep, aoudad potentially are the reservoirs for bacterial and viral diseases, such as pneumonia and bluetongue, and are possibly contributing to the decline of desert bighorn sheep. Herein, we optimized the multi‐locus sequence typing (MLST) with modifications in the Taq polymerase and annealing temperatures to determine the genetic identity of Mycoplasma strains or species within the nasal passages of desert bighorn sheep and aoudad in the Trans‐Pecos Ecoregion of Texas. Four loci (small ribosomal unit, 16S; 16S‐23S intergenic spacer region, IGS; RNA polymerase B, rpoB; gyrase B, gyrB) were characterized using MLST. Based on results from the modified MLST technique, we identified 9 desert bighorn sheep and 5 aoudad with M. ovipneumoniae, 9 aoudad with bacterial sequences genetically similar to M. conjunctivae, and 10 aoudad with bacterial sequences genetically similar M. hyopneumoniae. Of these, 9 aoudad possessed bacterial sequences genetically similar to both M. conjunctivae and M. hyopneumoniae. Among the 4 diagnostic loci, genetic divergence of M. ovipneumoniae ranged from 0.00–0.90% among desert bighorn sheep and aoudad. Future sampling efforts of seemingly asymptomatic aoudad, and asymptomatic, visibly sick, or deceased desert bighorn sheep, are important to monitor the spread of disease in desert bighorn sheep populations across mountain ranges in western Texas. It is imperative that aoudad removal plans are implemented to reduce and eliminate current infections and putative transmission of M. ovipneumoniae, prevent future disease outbreaks of pneumonia, and ultimately conserve desert bighorn sheep for future generations.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fc2c5fae4be72d1de9842a11c002feb84fa16162,fc2c5fae4be72d1de9842a11c002feb84fa16162,"[{'authorId': '2260925389', 'name': 'Emily A.

0404 Americas Prevalence of Insomnia Disorder in Adults: Estimation Using Currently Available Data,"
 
 
 Insomnia disorder is a major clinical issue due to its high prevalence and negative health outcomes. While the prevalence of insomnia in developed countries like the United States and Canada is known, its prevalence across the broader Americas region (Northern America, Latin America and the Caribbean) remains unclear. Limited epidemiological studies have been conducted and the majority of the Americas’ population does not have a reliable estimate for insomnia disorder. The purpose of this analysis was to estimate the Americas’ prevalence of adult insomnia disorder using published data.
 
 
 
 Published nation-specific estimates of the general population prevalence of insomnia disorder were applied to current population estimates for all countries in the Americas. We utilized the following criteria to determine which insomnia prevalence estimates to use: 1) studies that reported prevalence stratified by both age and sex together; 2) studies that reported prevalence by age and sex separately, we used the age-based results; 3) studies that reported prevalence by sex but not age; 4) studies that reported only a single prevalence estimate. Expert opinion was used to select the most methodologically rigorous study when >1 potential reference study existed for a nation. For countries lacking a reference study, we applied the estimates from a large, well-conducted study. Population estimates by sex and age (20yrs+) were sourced from the United Nations World Population Prospects 2022.
 
 
 
 There were 55 countries defined by the United Nations comprising the Americas of which 3 (5.5%) had a suitable prevalence estimate of insomnia. We estimated an Americas’ adult insomnia disorder prevalence of approximately 123 million adults (16.8%), comprised of 73 million females (19.5%) and 50 million males (14.0%). The nations with the greatest burden of insomnia disorder are the United States (37 million), Brazil (29 million), and Mexico (16 million).
 
 
 
 This large burden of disease, ~17% of adults, highlights the importance of comprehensive sleep health initiatives and the need for promotion of sleep health in public health policy. There is a lack of appropriate prevalence studies especially in low- and middle-income countries within the Americas.

Muddying the Waters: How Perceived Foreign Interference Affects Public Opinion on Protest Movements,"Does foreign interference help or harm protest movements? An extensive literature has debated this question but focuses on observational data, obscuring a crucial mechanism for protest success: its effect on public attitudes. We argue that public accusations of foreign meddling damage protest groups by reducing public support. In survey experiments conducted in the United States and Canada, we find that credible accusations of foreign interference erode support by discrediting protester groups among sympathizers and inflaming nationalist fears. Indeed, such accusations delegitimize protest movements even among those sympathetic to the cause. Conditional factors, such as the type of foreign assistance or the identity of the meddling state, have no impact. These findings reveal how referencing foreign backing is a potent discrediting tactic—it influences public opinion, a critical determinant for protest outcomes.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69168f60b1e1c3b8ce0a253319096733d5fabc2a,69168f60b1e1c3b8ce0a253319096733d5fabc2a,"[{'authorId': '2292589609', 'name': 'Wilfred M.

Emergency physician gender and head computed tomography orders for older adults who have fallen.,"OBJECTIVE
Physicians vary in their computed tomography (CT) scan usage. It remains unclear how physician gender relates to clinical practice or patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the association between physician gender and decision to order head CT scans for older emergency patients who had fallen.


METHODS
This was a secondary analysis of a prospective observational cohort study conducted in 11 hospital emergency departments (EDs) in Canada and the United States. The primary study enrolled patients who were 65 years and older who presented to the ED after a fall. The analysis evaluated treating physician gender adjusted for multiple clinical variables. Primary analysis used a hierarchical logistic regression model to evaluate the association between treating physician gender and the patient receiving a head CT scan. Secondary analysis reported the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for diagnosing intracranial bleeding by physician gender.


RESULTS
There were 3663 patients and 256 physicians included in the primary analysis. In the adjusted analysis, women physicians were no more likely to order a head CT than men (OR 1.26, 95% confidence interval 0.98-1.61). In the secondary analysis of 2294 patients who received a head CT, physician gender was not associated with finding a clinically important intracranial bleed.


CONCLUSIONS
There was no significant association between physician gender and ordering head CT scans for older emergency patients who had fallen. For patients where CT scans were ordered, there was no significant relationship between physician gender and the diagnosis of clinically important intracranial bleeding.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f01e2228a253171df52008b160712f75bce34771,f01e2228a253171df52008b160712f75bce34771,"[{'authorId': '2297751970', 'name': 'Rhys Kraft'}, {'authorId': '2269150396', 'name': 'Mathew Mercuri'}, {'authorId': '2269149204', 'name': 'Natasha Clayton'}, {'authorId': '2269149719', 'name': 'Andrew Worster'}, {'authorId': '2252345041', 'name': 'Eric Mercier'}, {'authorId': '2249329858', 'name': 'Marcel Émond'}, {'authorId': '72483855', 'name': 'Catherine Varner'}, {'authorId': '2261107684', 'name': 'Shelley L.

International variations in serum PTH and calcium levels and their mortality associations in peritoneal dialysis patients: Results from PDOPPS.,"BACKGROUND
Mineral bone disorder (MBD) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with high symptom burden, fractures, vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease and increased morbidity and mortality. CKD-MBD studies have been limited in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Here, we describe calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) control, related treatments and mortality associations in PD patients.


METHODS
We used data from eight countries (Australia and New Zealand (A/NZ), Canada, Japan, Thailand, South Korea, United Kingdom, United States (US)) participating in the prospective cohort Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (2014-2022) among patients receiving PD for >3 months. We analysed the association of baseline PTH and albumin-adjusted calcium (calciumAlb) with all-cause mortality using Cox regression, adjusted for potential confounders, including serum phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase.


RESULTS
Mean age ranged from 54.6 years in South Korea to 63.5 years in Japan. PTH and serum calciumAlb were measured at baseline in 12,642 and 14,244 patients, respectively. Median PTH ranged from 161 (Japan) to 363 pg/mL (US); mean calciumAlb ranged from 9.1 (South Korea, US) to 9.8 mg/dL (A/NZ). The PTH/mortality relationship was U-shaped, with the lowest risk at PTH 300-599 pg/mL. Mortality was nearly 20% higher at serum calciumAlb 9.6+ mg/dL versus 8.4-<9.6 mg/dL. MBD therapy prescriptions varied substantially across countries.


CONCLUSIONS
A large proportion of PD patients in this multi-national study have calcium and/or PTH levels in ranges associated with substantially higher mortality. These observations point to the need to substantially improve MBD management in PD to optimise patient outcomes.


LAY SUMMARY
Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (MBD) is a systemic condition, common in dialysis patients, that results in abnormalities in parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D metabolism. A large proportion of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients in this current multi-national study had calcium and/or PTH levels in ranges associated with substantially higher risks of death. Our observational study design limits our ability to determine whether these abnormal calcium and PTH levels cause more death due to possible confounding that was not accounted for in our analysis. However, our findings, along with other recent work showing 48-75% higher risk of death for the one-third of PD patients having high phosphorus levels (>5.5 mg/dL), should raise strong concerns for a greater focus on improving MBD management in PD patients.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d8e959b070595eb988e21d435f1b3a52a6ac86b1,d8e959b070595eb988e21d435f1b3a52a6ac86b1,"[{'authorId': '2243786000', 'name': 'Kosaku Nitta'}, {'authorId': '2791301', 'name': 'B.

A Comparative Analysis of Key Integration Blocks,"Why is integration progressing successfully in some parts of the world but not in others? Why are only some integration blocks hugely important for member countries? And why this is not the case globally? This article provides a comparative analysis of international economic structures, aiming to identify the factors that contribute to the validity and effectiveness of integration. 
The article examines eight economic blocks: the European Union, the Agreement between the United States of America, the United Mexican States and Canada, the Southern Common Market, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Euroasian Economic Union, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the African Union, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

A Prospective Observational Cohort Study of Language Preference and Preoperative Cognitive Screening in Older Adults: Do Language Disparities Exist in Cognitive Screening and Does the Association Between Test Results and Postoperative Delirium Differ Based on Language Preference?,"BACKGROUND
A greater percentage of surgical procedures are being performed each year on patients 65 years of age or older. Concurrently, a growing proportion of patients in English-speaking countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada have a language other than English (LOE) preference. We aimed to measure whether patients with LOE underwent cognitive screening at the same rates as their English-speaking counterparts when routine screening was instituted. We also aimed to measure the association between preoperative Mini-Cog and postoperative delirium (POD) in both English-speaking and LOE patients.


METHODS
We conducted a single-center, observational cohort study in patients 65 years old or older, scheduled for surgery and evaluated in the preoperative clinic. Cognitive screening of older adults was recommended as an institutional program for all patients 65 and older presenting to the preoperative clinic. We measured program adherence for cognitive screening. We also assessed the association of preoperative impairment on Mini-Cog and POD in both English-speaking and LOE patients, and whether the association differed for the 2 groups. A Mini-Cog score ≤2 was considered impaired. Postoperatively, patients were assessed for POD using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and by systematic chart review.


RESULTS
Over a 3-year period (February 2019-January 2022), 2446 patients 65 years old or older were assessed in the preoperative clinic prior. Of those 1956 patients underwent cognitive screening. Eighty-nine percent of English-speaking patients underwent preoperative cognitive screening, compared to 58% of LOE patients. The odds of having a Mini-Cog assessment were 5.6 times higher (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6-7.0) P < .001 for English-speaking patients compared to LOE patients. In English-speaking patients with a positive Mini-Cog screen, the odds of having postop delirium were 3.5 times higher (95% CI, 2.6-4.8) P < .001 when compared to negative Mini-Cog. In LOE patients, the odds of having postop delirium were 3.9 times higher (95% CI, 2.1-7.3) P < .001 for those with a positive Mini-Cog compared to a negative Mini-Cog. The difference between these 2 odds ratios was not significant (P = .753).


CONCLUSIONS
We observed a disparity in the rates LOE patients were cognitively screened before surgery, despite the Mini-Cog being associated with POD in both English-speaking and LOE patients. Efforts should be made to identify barriers to cognitive screening in limited English-proficient older adults.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8f6f2cb9801be739c07c813d36ee9a2550afaffa,8f6f2cb9801be739c07c813d36ee9a2550afaffa,"[{'authorId': '2059675284', 'name': 'Cecilia Canales'}, {'authorId': '2283129583', 'name': 'Cecilia M Ramirez'}, {'authorId': '2283174549', 'name': 'Shangyang C Yang'}, {'authorId': '2283129118', 'name': 'Sharon A Feinberg'}, {'authorId': '2252199899', 'name': 'Tristan R.

Patient Experience Survey Of Anti-VEGF Treatment for Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Diabetic Macular Edema.,"INTRODUCTION
Understanding patient perspectives of treatment may improve adherence and outcomes. This study explored real-world patient experiences with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME) and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).


METHODS
This multinational, non-interventional, quantitative, cross-sectional, observational survey assessed treatment barriers/burden, patient-reported visual functioning, and treatment satisfaction in DME and nAMD patients in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Italy, and Spain. Treatment patterns and visual outcomes were extracted from medical charts. Regression models evaluated relationships between adherence, total missed visits, number of anti-VEGF injections and clinical and patient-reported outcomes for visual functioning. Association between treatment satisfaction and aspects of burden were assessed.


RESULTS
The survey was completed by 183 DME and 391 nAMD patients. Patients had moderately high vision-related functioning (25-item National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire score: mean=74.8) and were satisfied with their current treatment (mean total score: Macular Disease Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire=59.2; Retinopathy Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire=61.3). Treatment satisfaction scores were worse with higher time-related impacts of treatment (nAMD/DME), higher impacts on finances and daily life (nAMD), negative impact on employment and lower expectations for treatment effectiveness (DME). Most patients reported ≥1 barrier (66.1% DME, 49.2% nAMD patients) related to treatment (35.0%), clinic (32.6%), and COVID-19 (21.1%). Moreover, 44.9% of patients reported some impairment in activities of daily living. Work absenteeism was observed among >60% of working patients. Nearly one-quarter (24.2%) of patients needed ≥1 day to recover from intravitreal injections; most reported ≥30 minutes of travel time (73.7%) and clinic wait time (54.2%). In unadjusted univariable analyses, treatment adherence (vs non adherence) was related to higher most recent visual acuity (β = 8.98 letters; CI, 1.34-16.62) and lower odds of visual acuity below driving vision (≤ 69 letters) (OR = 0.50; CI, 0.25-1.00) .


CONCLUSION
More durable treatments with reduced frequency of injections/visits may reduce treatment burden and improve patient satisfaction, which may enhance adherence and visual outcomes.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b689ff617932320154c6ca7e2b66cd79bb90381,4b689ff617932320154c6ca7e2b66cd79bb90381,"[{'authorId': '87588569', 'name': 'N.

Exploring cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders in the wake of COVID‐19 vaccination,"Abstract Background Individual reports have described lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) and cutaneous lymphomas emerging after administration of the COVID‐19 vaccine; however, the relationship between reactions and vaccine types has not yet been examined. Objective Determine if there are cases of cutaneous LPDs associated with certain COVID‐19 vaccines and their outcomes. Methods We analysed PubMed, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), and our database for instances of biopsy‐proven LPDs following COVID‐19 vaccines. Results Fifty cases of biopsy‐proven LPDs arising after COVID‐19 vaccination were found: 37 from medical literature, 11 from VAERS and two from our institution. Geographical distribution revealed the most cases in the United States, Italy, and Greece, with single cases in Spain, Colombia, Canada, Japan, and Romania. The average age of patients was 53; with a slight male predominance (male‐to‐female ratio of 1.5:1). The Pfizer‐BioNTech vaccine was associated with LPDs in 36/50 (72%) cases, aligning with its 70% share of the global vaccine market. Histopathology revealed CD30+ in 80% of cases. The most prevalent form of LPD was lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP, 30%). All reported cases produced favourable outcomes (either complete or near‐complete remission). Therapeutic approaches ranged from observation to treatment with steroids, methotrexate, or excision. Conclusion LPDs after COVID‐19 vaccination appear in the context of the same vaccines (proportionally to their global market shares), share clinical and pathological findings, and have indolent, self‐limited character.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c1de0e77444b06d60534d94a78c3c2d8fedc4acc,c1de0e77444b06d60534d94a78c3c2d8fedc4acc,"[{'authorId': '2258443795', 'name': 'Emily R.

Country-level methane emissions and their sectoral trends during 2009–2020 estimated by high-resolution inversion of GOSAT and surface observations,"Considering the significant role of global methane emissions in the Earth’s radiative budget, global or regionally persistent increasing trends in its emission are of great concern. Understanding the regional contributions of various emissions sectors to the growth rate thus has policy relevance. We used a high-resolution global methane inverse model to independently optimize sectoral emissions using GOSAT and ground-based observations for 2009–2020. Annual emission trends were calculated for top-emitting countries, and the sectoral contributions to the total anthropogenic trend were studied. Global total posterior emissions show a growth rate of 2.6 Tg yr−2 (p < 0.05), with significant contributions from waste (1.1 Tg yr−2) and agriculture (0.9 Tg yr−2). Country-level aggregated sectoral emissions showed statistically significant (p < 0.1) trends in total posterior emissions for China (0.56 Tg yr−2), India (0.22 Tg yr−2), United States (0.65 Tg yr−2), Pakistan (0.22 Tg yr−2) and Indonesia (0.28 Tg yr−2) among the top methane emitters. Emission sectors contributing to the above country-level emission trend are, China (waste 0.35; oil and gas 0.07 Tg yr−2), India (agriculture 0.09; waste 0.11 Tg yr−2), United States (oil and gas 1.0; agriculture 0.07; coal −0.15 Tg yr−2), Brazil (waste 0.09; agriculture 0.08 Tg yr−2), Russia (waste 0.04; biomass burning 0.15; coal 0.11; oil and gas −0.42 Tg yr−2), Indonesia (coal 0.28 Tg yr−2), Canada (oil and gas 0.08 Tg yr−2), Pakistan (agriculture 0.15; waste 0.03 Tg yr−2) and Mexico (waste 0.04 Tg yr−2). Additionally, our analysis showed that methane emissions from wetlands in Russia (0.24 Tg yr−2) and central African countries such as Congo (0.09 Tg yr−2), etc. have a positive trend with a considerably large increase after 2017, whereas Bolivia (−0.09 Tg yr−2) have a declining trend. Our results reveal some key emission sectors to be targeted on a national level for designing methane emission mitigation efforts.",2024,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/234380b92cf40df62bf4e8edb14cc00d1c1a665a,234380b92cf40df62bf4e8edb14cc00d1c1a665a,"[{'authorId': '26418126', 'name': 'Rajesh Janardanan'}, {'authorId': '2260743303', 'name': 'S.

"Ecological determinants of leishmaniasis vector, Lutzomyia spp.: A scoping review.","Leishmania spp. are zoonotic parasites transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies, including those of the Lutzomyia genus, which can cause leishmaniases in both humans and dogs. Lutzomyia spp. are established in many countries in South and Central America and some areas of the southern United States, with suspected potential of these vectors to undergo further range expansion due to climate change. A scoping review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extensions for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to describe the current state of knowledge on the key ecological factors associated with Lutzomyia spp. survival, reproduction and establishment. The following electronic databases were searched for eligible studies published from 1 January 1990, to the date of search, 26 April 2023: CAB Direct (CABI), MEDLINE (via Ovid), Biological Sciences Database and Environmental Sciences Database. Primary research articles that were available in English and focused on ecological factors associated with Lutzomyia spp., such as climatic and habitat factors, geographic range, seasonality and temporality, and host abundance, were eligible for inclusion in the study. Following de-duplication, a total of 167 studies were included in Level 1 screening, 64 studies were included in Level 2 screening and 31 studies met the criteria for data extraction. Study locations included Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, the United States, Mexico and Canada, with some studies including multiple regions. A total of 31 different Lutzomyia spp. were assessed across these studies, with most (51.6%) of the studies focused on Lutzomyia longipalpis. Eligible studies investigated factors such as seasonality (n = 5), temperature (n = 19), precipitation (n = 13), humidity (n = 2), vegetation presence or requirements (n = 13), ecotypes (n = 7), and/or community type (i.e., urban, suburban, rural) (n = 5). Lutzomyia spp. activity was found to be higher during the rainy season, and peak when temperatures were between 20 and 25°C. Lutzomyia spp. were also found to preferentially reside in tropical or subtropical forests, which are characterised by their lack of a distinct dry season and high precipitation. This scoping review summarised the current state of the literature on the ecological factors associated with the survival, activity and reproduction of Lutzomyia spp. While there appears to be some consensus in the literature regarding some ecological requirements (such as seasonality, temperature and habitat features), overall, there is a lack of published research in this topic. This poses a significant challenge for future studies, which aim to predict the future distribution of Lutzomyia spp. in the context of climate and land use changes. Additional ecological research is urgently needed on Lutzomyia spp. given their relevance to both human and animal health.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4cf5bcb43dd326a6eb61c802f0988ccb175def25,4cf5bcb43dd326a6eb61c802f0988ccb175def25,"[{'authorId': '2191594774', 'name': 'Sydney DeWinter'}, {'authorId': '2163421787', 'name': 'Keana Shahin'}, {'authorId': '1399072467', 'name': 'C.

Ready-to-eat cereal consumption is associated with improved nutrient intakes and diet quality in Canadian adults and children across income levels,"Background Results from observational studies suggest ready-to-eat cereal (RTEC) consumption is associated with higher diet quality. In the United States, studies have shown that RTEC is an important contributor to nutrient intakes across income levels. However, it is unknown if this association varies by income level in the Canadian population. Given its affordability, RTEC may represent an important source of nutrients for lower-income individuals. Objective This study evaluated the association of RTEC consumption with nutrient intakes and diet quality across household income levels in Canadian adults and children. Methods Income and dietary data from 24 h dietary recalls were obtained from the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)—Nutrition in 6,181 children (2–18 years) and 13,908 adults (19+ years). Diet quality was assessed with a modified Nutrient Rich Food Index (NRF) 9.3. Income levels were stratified into low, middle, and high based on family size, and data were analyzed by RTEC consumption and income level using multivariate linear regression adjusted for energy, age, and sex. Results Diet quality was greater in adult and child RTEC consumers across all household income levels. Children and adults consuming RTEC also had higher nutrient intakes, including shortfall nutrients such as calcium, dietary fiber, iron, magnesium, and vitamin D. RTEC provided <10% of energy intake, <4% of saturated fat intake, and <9% of total sugar intake across all ages and income levels, while also providing one-third of daily iron intake and at least 10% of daily intake of dietary fiber, thiamin, folate, and vitamin B6. Conclusion RTEC consumption was associated with improved nutrient intakes and diet quality in adults and children across household income levels. Nutrient dense and affordable food choices, such as RTEC, may be a helpful strategy to improve the diet quality of Canadians, particularly those with a lower household income.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/57438282e4568d6ac34cbc4ed9f29136862cbdcf,57438282e4568d6ac34cbc4ed9f29136862cbdcf,"[{'authorId': '2144388330', 'name': 'Lisa M.

Forward Editor's Note,"Forward Editor’s Note GREG ROBINSON The third issue of JTAS ushers in an expanded Forward section, both in the number and the diversity of selections, reflecting the amazing growth of the field. The excerpts reprinted in the Forward section, like the original articles we present, fall into multiple categories and follow different models. Still, they fall roughly into two groups. The first part, encompassing the texts produced by Deborah Cohen, Susan K. Harris, Lisa Rose Mar, Jeanne Campbell Reesman, and Sterling Stuckey, underlines in different ways the historical experience of border crossings, and the impact of foreign influences, especially those of racial “others,” on North American life. Deborah Cohen starts with literal border‐crossers, as she takes as her subject the “braceros”—Mexican nationals invited into the United States as guest workers between 1942 and 1964. While previous discussion of braceros has focused primarily on the exploitative labor conditions and racial prejudice they experienced, Cohen centers on the experiences of individuals and what they took away from it, as well as looking at cultural exchange over the border. Susan K. Harris provides an important addition—indeed corrective—to traditional accounts of the Spanish‐American War and the United States annexation of the Philippines. When historians have looked at international reaction to the war, they have tended to cite Rudyard Kipling’s poem “The White Man’s Burden,” inciting and justifying the American takeover of the Islands. Harris, exploring viewpoints from a variety of locations in Latin America and the European continent, and published in languages other than English, demonstrates convincingly that international opinion, as expressed in the press, was in fact predominantly hostile to US imperialism. Lisa Mar examines Chinese immigrant communities in turn‐of‐the‐century Canada through the lens of ethnic power brokers—interpreters, labor bosses, and community leaders. She argues persuasively that Asian North Americans, using transnational networks, were able to adjust and flourish despite discrimination, and even were able to conceal much of their true lives and community culture from the prying eyes of white immigration and other legal authorities. Jeanne Campbell Reesman and Sterling Stuckey present new transnational interpretations of iconic American writers.

Globalization and Its Discontents: Exposing the Underside,"In recent years, we have been treated to a sense of déjá vu of the sixties. Great numbers of mostly young people, men and women, mostly white, middle-class college students, have descended on major American cities such as Seattle and Washington, D.C., as well as their own campuses to protest a new and virulent form of injustice.1 Only this time, instead of protesting against war or racism, they raised their voices against something called “globalization.” Specifically, they named the related evils to be exposed and reformed, if not destroyed, as the World Trade Organization (WTO), which seeks to remove all barriers to world trade, such as regulations and tariffs erected by nation-states; the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), which prohibits signatory nations from impeding the flow of money and production facilities across their borders; the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, both created by the advanced economies to help poor countries “modernize” with loans and development projects; and sweatshops, the unregulated assembly plants. All of these are linked to globalization.2 The concern boiling over into outright objection to globalization has been brewing for some time. But if we have to pinpoint a specific event, we can begin with the Zapatista uprising in Mexico in January 1994.3 On that fateful day, the Indian peasants of Chiapas, Mexico’s southernmost province, rose up in rebellion, timing the protest to coincide with the first day of implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), eagerly signed by the governments of the United States, Canada, and Mexico to consolidate neoliberal economic policies and practices in the hemisphere. Dubbed the first postmodern uprising because the rebels professed no interest in seizing state power while demonstrating uncanny sophistication in generating and maintaining international media interest in their just cause, the Zapatistas were soon joined by other Indigenous and peasant insurgents in at least six other",2024,21,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7cff8dd34bc786fadaa9d66b878919ff1494c6cb,7cff8dd34bc786fadaa9d66b878919ff1494c6cb,"[{'authorId': '1405578716', 'name': 'E.

Forecasting Hourly Wildfire Risk: Enhancing Fire Danger Assessment using Numerical Weather Prediction,"
Wildfire agencies use Fire Danger Rating Systems (FDRS) to deploy resources and issue public safety measures. The most widely used FDRS is the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) System, which uses weather inputs to estimate the potential for wildfires to start and spread. Current FWI forecasts provide a daily numerical value, representing potential fire severity at an assumed midafternoon time for peak fire activity. This assumption, based on typical diurnal weather patterns, is not always valid. To address this, we developed an hourly FWI (HFWI) system using numerical weather prediction. We validate HFWI against the traditional daily FWI (DFWI) by comparing HFWI forecasts with observation-derived DFWI values from 917 surface fire weather stations in western North America. Results indicate strong correlations between forecasted HFWI and the observation-derived DFWI. A positive mean bias in the daily maximum values of HFWI compared to the traditional DFWI suggests that HFWI can better capture severe fire weather variations regardless of when they occur. We confirm this by comparing HFWI with hourly Fire Radiative Power (FRP) satellite observations for nine wildfire case studies in Canada and the United States. We demonstrate HFWI’s ability to forecast shifts in fire danger timing, especially during intensified fire activity in the late evening and early morning hours, while allowing for multiple periods of increased fire danger per day—a contrast to the conventional DFWI. This research highlights the HFWI system’s value in improving fire danger assessments and predictions, hopefully enhancing wildfire management, especially during atypical fire behavior.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/82f375fff0e8baca41d36965c576cdb26f95c309,82f375fff0e8baca41d36965c576cdb26f95c309,"[{'authorId': '2296109449', 'name': 'Christopher Rodell'}, {'authorId': '2296024242', 'name': 'Rosie Howard'}, {'authorId': '143753210', 'name': 'P.

Uncertainty and outliers in high‐resolution gridded precipitation products over eastern North America,"Several observational precipitation products that provide high temporal (≤3 h) and spatial (≤0.25°) resolution gridded estimates are available, although no single product can be assumed worldwide to be closest to the (unknown) “reality.” Here, we propose and apply a methodology to quantify the uncertainty of a set of precipitation products and to identify, at individual grid points, the products that are likely wrong (i.e., outliers). The methodology is applied over eastern North America for the 2015–2019 period for eight high‐resolution gridded precipitation products: CMORPH, ERA5, GSMaP, IMERG, MSWEP, PERSIANN, STAGE IV and TMPA. Four difference metrics are used to quantify discrepancies in different aspects of the precipitation time series, such as the total accumulation, two characteristics of the intensity‐frequency distribution, and the timing of precipitating events. Large regional and seasonal variations in the observational uncertainty are found across the ensemble. The observational uncertainty is higher in Canada than in the United States, reflecting large differences in the density of precipitation gauge measurements. In northern midlatitudes, the uncertainty is highest in winter, demonstrating the difficulties of satellite retrieval algorithms in identifying precipitation in snow‐covered areas. In southern midlatitudes, the uncertainty is highest in summer, probably due to the more discontinuous nature of precipitation.

Safety and Real-World Dosing of OnabotulinumtoxinA for the Treatment of Adult Spasticity,"Objective The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety of onabotulinumtoxinA treatment for spasticity across dose ranges in real-world practice. Design Adult Spasticity International Registry was a multicenter, prospective, observational study (NCT01930786) of onabotulinumtoxinA treatment for adult spasticity over 2 yrs. Adverse events, serious adverse events, treatment-related adverse events, and serious treatment-related adverse events were sorted into five categories (≤200, 201–400, 401–600, 601–800, ≥801 U) based on cumulative dose per session. Results In 3103 treatment sessions (T), 730 patients received ≥1 dose of onabotulinumtoxinA. Dose categories included the following: ≤200 U (n = 312, T = 811), 201–400 U (n = 446, T = 1366), 401–600 U (n = 244, T = 716), 601–800 U (n = 69, T = 149), and ≥801 U (n = 29, T = 61). Of these patients, 261 reported 827 adverse events, 94 reported 195 serious adverse events, 20 reported 23 treatment-related adverse events, and 2 patients treated with 201–400 U onabotulinumtoxinA reported 3 serious treatment-related adverse events. Treatment-related adverse events reported included ≤200 U (8/811, 0.9%), 201–400 U (7/1366, 0.5%), 401–600 U (6/716, 0.8%), 601–800 U (1/149, 0.7%), and ≥801 U (1/61, 1.6%). Conclusions In this post hoc analysis, most treatment sessions were performed with 201–400 U onabotulinumtoxinA. Patients treated with 201–400 U onabotulinumtoxinA had an adverse event profile consistent with onabotulinumtoxinA package inserts globally (e.g., United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Canada). No new safety signals were identified.",2024,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b798d075467f2f3218f8353e494b8679500adf0b,b798d075467f2f3218f8353e494b8679500adf0b,"[{'authorId': '4596478', 'name': 'G.

Abstract PO5-12-02: Landscape analysis of oncology nutrition research among patients being treated for breast cancer,"
 The American Institute for Cancer Research/World Cancer Research Fund and the American Cancer Society regularly conduct systematic reviews on the evidence supporting nutrition interventions during cancer treatment. These reviews have found that the evidence to support clinical oncology nutrition practice guidelines is limited. It is unclear how many oncology nutrition studies are currently being conducted, especially among patients being treated for breast cancer. The goal of this project was to conduct a landscape analysis of nutrition research being conducted among breast cancer patients over the past 10 years. Methods: This analysis was part of a larger effort to describe the oncology nutrition research landscape for all cancer sites. Searches of ClinicalTrials.gov were performed on 1/8/2023 using the following search terms/combinations: “cancer AND nutrition”, “cancer nutrition”, “oncology AND nutrition”, “diet AND cancer”, “cancer, oncology, neoplasms, nutrition, diet”. Search results were downloaded as .csv files and uploaded to RStudio for merging and data cleaning (elimination of duplicates, and exclusion of studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov before 1/1/2013 or after 12/31/2022). The resulting harmonized dataset was then uploaded to REDCap, and each entry was reviewed for eligibility by one of the authors. To be included in this landscape analysis, studies must have included data collection from patients who were actively receiving cancer treatment at the time of the study and the study had to be first posted to ClinicalTrials.gov between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2022. Studies were excluded if they: 1) focused on the role of diet in primary cancer prevention, 2) focused on cancer survivors who had completed primary treatment for their cancers. Following eligibility review, the study datafile was returned to RStudio for further cleaning and analysis. Results: The initial ClinicalTrials.gov search identified 4,345 unique study listings. After review, 1,267 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 132 (10.4%) studies were specific to breast cancer (117 intervention studies and 15 observational studies). Among breast cancer studies, reasons for exclusion were: study focused on diet/nutrition in the prevention of a primary cancer diagnosis (n=40), study participants had already completed their cancer treatment (n=128), study did not include a diet/nutrition intervention or assessment (n=31). The largest number of breast cancer specific studies were based in the United States (n=55, 41.6%), Italy (n=11, 8.3%), France (n=10, 7.6%) and Canada (n=9, 6.8%). Dietary supplement interventions were the most common type of intervention (n=50 studies, 42.7%), followed by behavior change interventions (n=22, 18.8%), diet in relation to a drug intervention (n=25, 21.4%), diet in relation to a device/procedure/radiation intervention (n=16, 14%), fasting/time-restricted feeding studies (n=13, 11.1%) and ketogenic diet interventions (n=3, 2.6%). Changes in weight or body composition (n=52, 39.4%), quality of life (n=45, 34.1%), adverse events (n=24, 18.2%), survival (n=20, 15,2%) and fatigue (n=17, 12.9%) were the most common outcome measures. Sixteen (12.1%) studies were supported by NIH funding and 9 (6.8%) studies were industry funded, although the majority (n=124, 93.9%) reported funding from “other” sources. Of the 41 studies that started between 2013-2017 (five years prior to the January 2023 ClinicalTrials.gov search), only 21 (51.2%) were listed as being “completed” and of those, only 7 were listed as “has results”. Conclusion: More research is needed to support evidence-based supportive care guidelines for oncology nutrition interventions during breast cancer treatment. Efforts should be made to support researchers in completing studies and disseminating research findings.

Enhancing Hospital Pharmacy Operations Through Lean and Six Sigma Strategies: A Systematic Review.,"Hospital pharmacies are integral to the healthcare system, and evaluating the factors influencing their efficiency and service standards is imperative. This analysis offers global insights to assist in developing strategies for future enhancements. The objective is to identify the optimal Lean Six Sigma methodologies to improve workflow and quality of hospital pharmacy services. A strategic search, aligned with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, encompassed an extensive range of academic databases, including Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and other sources for relevant studies published from 2009 to 2023. The focus was on management tactics and those examining outcomes, prioritizing publications reflecting pharmacy operations management's state. The quality of the selected articles was assessed, and the results were combined and analyzed. The search yielded 1,447 studies, of which 73 met the inclusion criteria. The systematic review found a low to moderate overall risk of bias. The number of publications rose during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. Among studies, research output in the United States of America represented 26% of the total. Other countries such as Indonesia, Spain, Canada, China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom also made significant contributions. Each country accounted for 12%, 8%, 7%, 5%, 5%, 5%, and 5%, respectively. The pharmacy journals led with 26 publications, and healthcare/medical with 14. The quality category came next with 12 articles, while seven journals represented engineering. Studies used empirical and observational methods, focusing on practice quality enhancement. The process control plan had 26 instances, and the define, measure, analyze, improve, and control (DMAIC) was identified 13 times. The sort, set in order, shine, standardize, and sustain (5S) ranked third, totaling seven occurrences. Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) and root cause analysis were moderately utilized, with six and four instances, respectively. Poka-Yoke (mistake-proofing measures) and value stream mapping were each counted three times. Quality improvement and workflow optimization dominated managerial strategies in 22 (30.14%) studies each, followed by technology integration in 15 (20.55%). Cost, patient care, and staffing each featured in three (4.11%) studies, while two (2.74%) focused on inventory management. One (1.37%) study each highlighted continuing education, collaboration, and policy changes. Analysis of the 73 studies on Lean and Six Sigma in hospital pharmacy operations showed significant impacts, with 26% of studies reporting decreased medication turnaround time, 15% showing process efficiency improvements, and 11% each for enhanced inventory management and bottleneck/failure mode reduction. Additionally, 9% of studies observed decreased medication errors, 8% noted increased satisfaction and cost savings, 6% identified enhancements in clinical activities, 3% improved prescription accuracy, 2% reduced workflow interruptions, and 1% reported increased knowledge. Also, this study has identified key strategies for service delivery improvement and the importance of quality practices and lean leadership. To the best of the author's knowledge, this research is believed to be the first in-depth analysis of Lean and Six Sigma in the hospital pharmacy domain, spanning 15 years from 2009 to 2023.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3d8adef11cf15f6f9e2a532e545ae115b5a0209,b3d8adef11cf15f6f9e2a532e545ae115b5a0209,"[{'authorId': '2293860033', 'name': 'Mohammed Sallam'}]"
A Study of Global Trade War and Its Impact on Indian Economy,"Introduction
1. In an era of globalization, international trade is inevitable. When we walk into a supermarket and find South American bananas, Malaysian rubber products, Brazilian coffee, we simply experience the impact of global trade. Global trade allows all countries around the world to publicise their markets and to supply goods and services that otherwise would not have been open to the domestic economy. As all goods and services are available at relatively cheaper prices in the international market, therefore domestic market becomes more competitive. People have got choices for competitive products. Therefore, the difference in the prices of goods of the foreign economy and domestic economy results in international trade.

2. Why nations trade with each other ? Not a single nation alone can generate all the goods and services for its households in today’s world of limitless desires. There is an unequal distribution of factors of production over the countries of the world. Countries of the world differ from each other in terms of natural resources, technology, entrepreneurial and managerial skills which determine the ability of the country concerned, at the lowest cost of production, to manufacture goods and services. For example, South Korea can manufacture cars or microelectronic products effectively in comparison with any other nation in the world, similarly Malaysia could produce rubber and palm oil more efficiently. The ability to manufacture these products, such as electronics or rubber, is much greater than their ability to consume these goods within the country so that they can sell these goods at comparatively cheaper prices to other countries around the world. Similarly, India and Brazil can import certain products from South Korea and Malaysia at lower prices and can in exchange, import Brazilian coffee or Indian textiles at a lower price. Therefore, generally trade benefits all the countries of the world provided it is free trade. If one country has a belief in free trade and the other beliefs in the opposite, only the previous one will end practicing free trade and suffering in the end. Economists say that trade conflicts safeguard economic interests and are advantageous to the local market, but critics claim that they ultimately hurt local companies, consumers, and the economy in long run. Protectionist policies always harm the concept of globalization. According to the World Commission on the social dimension of globalization (2004). “Globalisation should benefit all the countries and should raise the welfare of all people throughout the world”. Advocates of protectionist view put arguments in favour of restrictions of the trade like the expansion of the home market, keeping money at home, counteracting foreign low wages, defence or national security arguments, protection of infant industry, anti-dumping arguments, and balance of payment arguments. Trade restrictions are of two types; tariff barriers and non-tariff barriers. The tariff barrier is the most common barrier to trade. It is the tax or duties that one country imposes on exported or imported goods. There are various types of tariff barriers in international trade. If the tariff is imposed based on the physical weight of some goods, imported or exported, called a specific tariff.
• If a tariff is imposed on the value of some goods, imported or exported is called “Ad Valorem tariff”.
• If different rates of the tariff are imposed on different countries called discriminatory tariffs.
• If the same rates of a tariff are imposed on different countries, called non-discriminatory tariff’.
• If the main purpose of imposing a tariff is to produce revenue, called a revenue tariff.
• And the most commonly used tariff is the Protective tariff. if the tariff is imposed mainly to protect domestic industries from foreign competitions are called the protective tariff
4. Followers of the protectionist policy argue that tariff imposition has two impacts; revenue increases after the imposition of tariff and home production increases which is called protective effect but if other countries retaliate in the same manner, the trade war is inevitable. A situation of trade war erupts when one nation or economy strike back against another economy by imposing trade barriers. The application of trade restrictions is not a new concept in international trade. If we study the background of the global trade war, we find that countries frequently used trade restrictions in global trade. The situation was aggravated after the second world war. Most of the countries were intentionally devaluing their currency to increase their export and minimise imports. This was also the reason for the currency war between countries.
5. We can divide the world trade in the pre-Bretton Woods and post Bretton Woods period. An efficient international monetary system is very essential for the smooth functioning and expansion of international trade. From the early 19th century until the first world war, the era was regarded as a period of internationalism. Most of the major industrialised nations of the world started participating in world trade. After the second world war and the hectic slump and currency war that followed it all the countries of the world wished to return to normalcy. Two causes were responsible for this wish: -
• Reconstruction of the economies ravaged by the war.
• To end the currency war.
As far as the second cause is concerned many countries or the trading partners of the world started devaluating its currency to improve the conditions of their BOP. This resulted in a trade war between nations. Therefore, in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, USA, members of 44 countries met to discuss these problems and to find realistic solutions for them. This conference proposed the establishment of: -
• The International Monetary Fund (IMF), to help member countries to meet their BOP deficit problem.
• IBRD, to reconstruct and develop economies of member countries.
• An International Trade Organisation (ITO), to solve the problem of international trade and proper liberalisation of it.
6. However, the proposal for the International Trade Organisation did not materialise and the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) was formed. The GATT was established in 1948 with a big and important objective of “free trade” and “no trade war”. Its main purpose was to remove trade restrictions which sooner or later converts into a trade war. The first seven rounds of GATT were focussed on the removal of trade barriers only. Despite these discussions in several rounds of GATT, it couldn’t provide a useful forum for discussion on international trade issues.
7. The 8th round of GATT is called Uruguay Round which started in 1986. Member countries negotiated in the areas of Tariffs, Non-Tariff Measures, Tropical Production, Natural resource-based products, Agriculture, GATT articles, Safeguards, Multilateral trade negotiation agreement, Subsidies, Disputes Settlement, Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPPS), Trade-Related Investments measures (TRIMS), Functioning of GATT system (FOGS).
Despite serious discussion on these issues’ agreement could not be reached and member countries kept on using trade and non-trade barriers on each other.


8. COVID-19 pandemic, which started in March 2020, has adversely affected global trade. As per WTO statistics, a 3% fall in the volume of merchandise (export and import) trade is seen in the first quarter of 2020. Lockdown in many economies of the world aggravated the problem and declines are historically large. Strict social distancing and majors and restrictions on travel and transport adversely affected the service sector of the world economy which is the main contributor to gross domestic product (GDP) of many countries. Therefore, the economic recovery from the COVID situation is highly uncertain. This situation might give a boost to the global trade war which will be the endeavour during the research to be found out and a description of the same has been covered in Chapter 3. The research has tried to reveal how the pandemic has crippled the world economy and aggravating the pre-existing problem of the trade war. The recent trade war between China and the USA is an apt example. 


Recent Examples of Trade War​​

9. Since the year 2018 world has been witnessing trade conflict which was earlier currency conflict between the USA and its economic partners mainly the EU and China. But in this conflict US’s all-weather friend Canada and Mexico were also hit. However, retaliation by other countries has been very limited. In March 2018, the United States announced the imposition of additional tariffs under Section 232 on imports of steel (25%) and aluminium (10%) from China to the United States. This might harm the Chinese economy as China is the major contributor of crude and finished steel in the world.

10. In the same month, the US President announced his strategy to endorse restrictions against China over its Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) policies which were severely affecting its stakeholders. In this sanction, the US raised tariffs by 24 to 25% on selected Chinese products which were valued to the tune of approximately $50 billion. By adopting the policy of quid pro quo China on 01 April responded with 25% tariffs on $50 billion in US exports on various American products, like agriculture, pork, and cars. On 3rd April 2018, the US administration released a list of 1,333 goods equivalent to $50 billion in trade, which it said would enforce a 25% tariff.
11. These Chinese products mainly belong to the category of important sectors like robotics, rail and shipping, information technology, health care, and medicine, and high-technology. China retaliated and published a list of 106 products on which 25% tariffs were imposed and its value was worth $50 billion in trade. Thus, quid pro quo tactics kept ongoing between China and the US.

The use of environmental data in descriptive and predictive models of vector-borne disease in North America,"Vector-borne disease incidence and burden are on the rise. Weather events and climate patterns are known to influence vector populations and disease distribution and incidence. Changes in weather trends and climatic factors can shift seasonal vector activity and host behavior, thus altering pathogen distribution and introducing diseases to new geographic regions. With the upward trend in global temperature, changes in the incidence and distribution of disease vectors possibly linked to climate change have been documented. Forecasting and modeling efforts are valuable for incorporating climate into predicting changes in vector and vector-borne disease distribution. These predictions serve to optimize disease outbreak preparedness and response. The purpose of this scoping review was to describe the use of climate data in vector-borne disease prediction in North America between 2000 and 2022. The most investigated diseases were West Nile virus infection, Lyme disease, and dengue. The uneven geographical distribution of publications could suggest regional differences in the availability of surveillance data required for vector-borne disease predictions and forecasts across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Studies incorporated environmental data from ground-based sources, satellite data, previously existing data, and field-collected data. While environmental data such as meteorological and topographic factors were well-represented, further research is warranted to ascertain if relationships with less common variables, such as oceanographic characteristics and drought, hold among various vector populations and throughout wider geographical areas. This review provides a catalogue of recently used climatic data that can inform future assessments of the value of such data in vector-borne disease models.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ebef71655e5c80c62138d98a2dab27e95362e0f0,ebef71655e5c80c62138d98a2dab27e95362e0f0,"[{'authorId': '2289805904', 'name': 'Hanna D Kiryluk'}, {'authorId': '2268899876', 'name': 'Charles B.

Menu labeling and portion size control to improve the out‐of‐home food environment: A scoping review,"Menu labeling and portion size control interventions may be effective strategies to mitigate the health risks posed by the out‐of‐home food environment. We conducted this scoping review to map the body of evidence (BoE) addressing the effects of menu labeling and portion size control interventions in the out‐of‐home food environment and to summarize the research gaps in this evidence base.We searched PubMed, Embase, Epistemonikos, and PROSPERO in phase 1 for systematic reviews (SRs) and PubMed and Embase in phase 2 for primary studies in areas with insufficient SR evidence. We used a comprehensive search strategy without any restrictions on publication date, language, study population characteristics or outcomes. We screened all titles independently and in duplicate. We mapped the number of systematic reviews providing evidence per intervention‐setting combination in a matrix. The gaps in the matrix informed the searches for primary studies in phase 2. For the included SR protocols and primary studies, we charted the population, intervention, comparator, outcome, period, and study design to facilitate their evaluation and inclusion in future evidence syntheses.We included 69 completed SRs; 37 on menu labeling, 9 on portion size control, and 23 on both. The types of menu labeling interventions studied were quantitative nutrient information (74%), interpretational guidance (48%), or contextual guidance (13%). Most reviews were from the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. Most SRs included studies in establishments like cafeterias (51%) or restaurants (39%) and measured change in the quantity of food offered/ordered/consumed (96%). Phase 2 search yielded 24 primary studies; 16 experimental, 6 quasi‐experimental, and 2 observational studies.The BoE on the effectiveness of menu labeling and portion size control is predominantly from the developed world, on nutrient information labeling and reporting impact on consumer food choice.

Impact of International Trade Agreements on Corporate Law,"International Trade Agreements (ITAs) have a significant impact on corporate law. ITAs typically include provisions that affect a wide range of corporate law issues, such as reducing or eliminating tariffs and other trade barriers making it easier for corporations to export their goods and services to foreign markets, other provisions might protect foreign investment and promote investment flows between countries making it more attractive for corporations to invest in foreign markets. Some ITAs protect intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, copyrights, and patents that is important for corporations that rely on intellectual property to protect their products and services and ITAs also promote competition and prohibit anti-competitive practices which help ensuring that corporations compete fairly in the global marketplace.
In addition, ITAs can also have a broader impact, for instance, ITAs can promote the adoption of common legal standards and practices, making it easier for corporations to do business in different countries.
For Example, The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) includes provisions that made it easier for corporations to move goods and services between the United States, Canada, and Mexico leading to increased investment flows between these countries. The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) has helped to strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights around the world which benefited corporations that rely on intellectual property to protect their products and services. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) includes provisions that promote competition and prohibit anti-competitive practices in the Asia-Pacific region ensuring that corporations are competing fairly in the market.
Overall, this Research Paper summarises how ITAs have a significant impact on corporate law and Corporations involved in international trade should be aware of the provisions of the relevant ITAs and how these provisions may affect their business.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a2cf495e157879225a9a4a2dadf241f6ff6cb47,2a2cf495e157879225a9a4a2dadf241f6ff6cb47,"[{'authorId': '2299449094', 'name': 'Ankit Thakur'}]"
Vaccination services in community pharmacy practice: a scoping review,"
 
 
 Vaccination services in community pharmacy practice is an important advancement in public health and has increased since the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of vaccination in community pharmacy practice and stakeholders’ views of vaccination services has not been recently reported.
 
 
 
 This scoping review explores the provision of vaccinations in community pharmacy (vaccine type and to which patient groups provided) and key stakeholders’ (patients/carers and pharmacists) views of the vaccination services provided.
 
 
 
 The study was registered with Open Science Framework, and Joanna Briggs Institute guidance was used to define the following inclusion criteria:[1-2]
 Participants: Studies involving patients of any age and other demographic variables receiving a vaccination service in any community pharmacy setting.
 Concept: Studies that reported on the implementation and evaluation of all vaccination services provided by pharmacists in the community pharmacy setting. Evaluation studies of vaccination services considered evaluation by patients and pharmacists.
 Context: Studies involving provision of vaccination services by pharmacists in community pharmacy in any geographical location. Vaccination services provided by other healthcare professionals were not included.
 Searches were performed in CINAHL, EMBASE and MEDLINE (EBSCO) on 06/03/2023 using database-relevant controlled vocabulary (e.g., ‘pharmacy’, ‘vaccination’ and ‘service’). Grey literature searching was undertaken in MedNar. All study designs were considered for inclusion without publication date limits. Titles and abstracts were reviewed independently by two researchers and discrepancies resolved via discussion. Data extraction was undertaken using a modified JBI data extraction form. A mixed methods approach to data synthesis was used, with study characteristics analysed quantitatively and patients’/pharmacists’ views on vaccination services analysed qualitatively.
 
 
 
 A total of 3245 records were identified from the database searches for screening, with a further 211 from the grey literature. A total of 102 studies were included. Most studies were undertaken in the United States of America (43; 42.2%), Canada (17; 16.7%) and the UK (8; 7.8%). Study types included cross-sectional (67; 65.7%), retrospective observational studies (15; 14.7%) and non-systematic reviews (10; 9.8%).
 The influenza vaccine (40; 39.2%) was most commonly provided, followed by COVID-19 (14; 13.7%). Other vaccines provided included herpes zoster and human papillomavirus. Vaccinations were targeted to all age-groups relevant to the vaccine supplied.
 Patient satisfaction rates were high across various countries with experiences focussing on access, professionalism and quality of information provided.
 Pharmacists reported having a positive outlook on their role in providing vaccination services. Pharmacists viewed vaccination services based in community pharmacies as an opportunity to contribute to the well-being of their communities and improve immunisation rates. Pharmacists also reported barriers to vaccine service provision which included regulation, training, remuneration and storage, which may consequently limit service expansion.
 
 
 
 A range of vaccines are available in community pharmacy, which has led to increases in patients availing of vaccination services. Patients’ and pharmacists’ perceptions towards the service are positive. Future research could address barriers, identified by pharmacists, which prevent expansion of vaccination services. Screening and data extraction involving seven reviewers was a strength of the study. As a scoping review, the study is limited as records were not quality appraised.

Rationale and Design of the Statins Use in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Patients (SATURN) Trial.,"INTRODUCTION
The benefits and risks of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) drugs in survivors of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are unclear. Observational studies suggest an association between statin use and increased risk of lobar ICH, particularly in patients with apolipoprotein-E (APOE) ε2 and ε4 genotypes. There are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) addressing the effects of statins after ICH leading to uncertainty as to whether statins should be used in patients with lobar ICH who are at high risk for ICH recurrence. The SATURN trial aims to evaluate the effects of continuation versus discontinuation of statin on the risk of ICH recurrence and ischemic major adverse cerebro-cardio-vascular events (MACCE) in patients with lobar ICH. Secondary aims include the assessment of whether the APOE genotype modifies the effects of statins on ICH recurrence, functional and cognitive outcomes and quality of life.


METHODS
The SATURN trial is a multi-center, pragmatic, prospective, randomized, open-label, Phase III clinical trial with blinded end-point assessment. A planned total of 1456 patients with lobar ICH will be recruited from 140 sites in the United States, Canada and Spain. Patients presenting within seven days of a spontaneous lobar ICH that occurred while taking a statin, will be randomized (1:1) to continuation (control) vs. discontinuation (intervention) of the same statin drug and dose that they were using at ICH onset. The primary outcome is the time to recurrent symptomatic ICH within a two-year follow-up period. The primary safety outcome is the occurrence of ischemic MACCE.


CONCLUSION
The results will help to determine the best strategy for statin use in survivors of lobar ICH and may help to identify if there is a subset of patients who would benefit from statins.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dcbb16b6860550dee4136fcba3cd7edf7025d4a1,dcbb16b6860550dee4136fcba3cd7edf7025d4a1,"[{'authorId': '2276756046', 'name': 'Sarah Marchina'}, {'authorId': '145864125', 'name': 'S.
