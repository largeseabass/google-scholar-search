"Methane emissions in the United States, Canada, and Mexico: evaluation of national methane emission inventories and 2010–2017 sectoral trends by inverse analysis of in situ (GLOBALVIEWplus CH4 ObsPack) and satellite (GOSAT) atmospheric observations","Abstract. We quantify methane emissions and their 2010–2017 trends by sector in the
contiguous United States (CONUS), Canada, and Mexico by inverse analysis of in
situ (GLOBALVIEWplus CH4 ObsPack) and satellite (GOSAT) atmospheric
methane observations. The inversion uses as a prior estimate the national
anthropogenic emission inventories for the three countries reported by the US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Environment and Climate Change Canada
(ECCC), and the Instituto Nacional de Ecología y Cambio Climático
(INECC) in Mexico to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) and thus serves as an evaluation of these inventories in terms of
their magnitudes and trends. Emissions are optimized with a Gaussian mixture
model (GMM) at 0.5∘×0.625∘ resolution and for
individual years. Optimization is done analytically using lognormal error
forms. This yields closed-form statistics of error covariances and information
content on the posterior (optimized) estimates, allows better representation
of the high tail of the emission distribution, and enables construction of a
large ensemble of inverse solutions using different observations and
assumptions. We find that GOSAT and in situ observations are largely
consistent and complementary in the optimization of methane emissions for
North America. Mean 2010–2017 anthropogenic emissions from our base GOSAT + in situ inversion, with ranges from the inversion ensemble, are 36.9
(32.5–37.8) Tg a−1 for CONUS, 5.3 (3.6–5.7) Tg a−1
for Canada, and 6.0 (4.7–6.1) Tg a−1 for Mexico. These are higher
than the most recent reported national inventories of 26.0 Tg a−1
for the US (EPA), 4.0 Tg a−1 for Canada (ECCC), and
5.0 Tg a−1 for Mexico (INECC). The correction in all three
countries is largely driven by a factor of 2 underestimate in emissions from
the oil sector with major contributions from the south-central US, western
Canada, and southeastern Mexico. Total CONUS anthropogenic emissions in our
inversion peak in 2014, in contrast to the EPA report of a steady decreasing
trend over 2010–2017. This reflects offsetting effects of increasing
emissions from the oil and landfill sectors, decreasing emissions from the gas
sector, and flat emissions from the livestock and coal sectors. We find
decreasing trends in Canadian and Mexican anthropogenic methane emissions over
the 2010–2017 period, mainly driven by oil and gas emissions. Our best
estimates of mean 2010–2017 wetland emissions are 8.4
(6.4–10.6) Tg a−1 for CONUS, 9.9 (7.8–12.0) Tg a−1
for Canada, and 0.6 (0.4–0.6) Tg a−1 for Mexico. Wetland
emissions in CONUS show an increasing trend of +2.6 (+1.7 to
+3.8)% a−1 over 2010–2017
correlated with precipitation.

"A Comprehensive Methodology for Evaluating the Economic Impacts of Floods: An Application to Canada, Mexico, and the United States","In 2020, we developed a comprehensive methodology (henceforth, the methodology) to assess flood-related economic costs. The methodology covers direct damages, indirect effects, and losses and additional costs across 105 social, infrastructure, economic, and emergency response indicators. As a companion paper, this study presents findings from analysis of applying the methodology to investigate economic costs for major flood events between 2013 and 2017 and to assess gaps in the existing datasets across Canada, Mexico, and the United States. In addition, we conducted one case study from each country for an in-depth examination of the applicability of the methodology. Applying the methodology, Mexico showed the most complete flood indicator data availability and accessibility among the three countries. We found that most flood-related economic cost assessments evaluated only direct damages, and indirect effect data were rarely included in datasets in the three countries. Moreover, few of the records from Canada and the United States captured the losses and additional costs. Flood-related economic cost data at the municipal or county level were easily accessible in Mexico and the United States. Mexico’s National Center for Prevention of Disasters (Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres), unique among the three nations, provided access to centralized and comprehensive flood cost data. In the United States and Canada, data collection by multiple agencies that focus on different jurisdictions and scales of flood damage complicated comprehensive data collection and led to incomplete economic cost assessments. Our analysis strongly suggests that countries should aim to expand the set of data indicators available and become more granular across space and time while maintaining data quality. This study provides significant insights about approaches for collating spatial, temporal, and outcome-specific localized flood economic costs and the major data gaps across the three countries.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5d9e47a5a262aa4a6280bc8bdeee835a171bf90a,5d9e47a5a262aa4a6280bc8bdeee835a171bf90a,"[{'authorId': '88438689', 'name': 'Xin Wen'}, {'authorId': '2140173269', 'name': 'Ana M.

"Adults' Exposure to Unhealthy Food and Beverage Marketing: A Multi-country Study in Australia, Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, and United States.","BACKGROUND
Food marketing increases product appeal, purchasing and consumption, using diverse strategies and locations to reach consumers.


OBJECTIVES
The aim of this study was to examine differences in adults' self-reported exposure to various marketing strategies (brand and licensed characters, celebrities, sponsorship of sports and cultural events) and locations (television, radio, digital media) across five countries: Australia, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US).


METHODS
We analyzed cross-sectional survey data on self-reported exposure to food marketing strategies and locations collected in 2018 by the International Food Policy Study (IFPS). Participants (n = 21,678) aged ≥ 18 years completed an online survey. Exposure to unhealthy food marketing strategies and locations in the last 30 days were self-reported. Regression models examined differences in marketing exposure and locations across countries.


RESULTS
The average number of unhealthy food marketing strategies to which participants reported being exposed ranged from 0.5 in the UK to 2.3 in Mexico. Self-reported exposure to strategies across all countries was highest for brand characters (32%), followed by licensed characters (22%). In total, the reported mean exposure of marketing locations was 1.6 in the last month. Television was the most prevalent location (44%), followed by digital marketing (32%). Adjusted models indicated that the odds of reporting exposure to marketing strategies and marketing locations was higher for Mexico compared to the rest of the countries.


CONCLUSIONS
Adults report a variety of exposures to unhealthy food marketing in all countries, but exposure was highest in Mexico. Special attention should be paid to regulating marketing strategies such as brand characters, licensed characters, and locations such as television, and digital marketing.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45d166118e91baf9971623375379d5c5755936a2,45d166118e91baf9971623375379d5c5755936a2,"[{'authorId': '89573275', 'name': 'Claudia Nieto'}, {'authorId': '46728613', 'name': 'Alejandra Jáuregui'}, {'authorId': '1402238358', 'name': 'Alejandra Contreras-Manzano'}, {'authorId': '2248226874', 'name': 'M.

"Low- and no-calorie sweetener intakes from beverages – an up-to-date assessment in four regions: Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the United States","Abstract The current assessment estimated exposure to four low- and no-calorie sweeteners (LNCS) (aspartame, acesulfame potassium (AceK), steviol glycosides and sucralose) from beverages in Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the United States, using up-to-date nationally representative consumption data and industry reported-use level information. Two modelling scenarios were applied – the probabilistic model was guided by reported use level data, with estimated intake for an individual leveraging market-weighted average use level of a particular LNCS in any given LNCS-sweetened beverage type, while the distributional (brand-loyal) model assumed consumer behaviour-led patterns, namely that an individual will be brand loyal to a pre-determined beverage type. Consumer-only and general population intake estimates were derived for the overall population and individual age categories, and compared to the respective acceptable daily intake (ADI) as established by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) for each LNCS. The mean, 90th percentile and 95th percentile intake estimates were substantially lower than the ADI in both modelling scenarios, regardless of the population group or market. In the probabilistic model, the highest consumer-only intake was observed for AceK in Brazilian adolescents (95th percentile, 12.4% of the ADI), while the highest 95th percentile intakes in the distributional model were observed for sucralose in Canadian adults at 20.9% of the ADI. This study provides the latest insights into current intakes of LNCS from water-based non-alcoholic LNCS-sweetened beverages in these regions, aligning well with those published elsewhere.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/910c0d4bd25d12cba8927da10dbb5c60961251b8,910c0d4bd25d12cba8927da10dbb5c60961251b8,"[{'authorId': '21079483', 'name': 'Y.

2022 Source Labeled Unlabeled Belgium France Norway Validation China Target United States Canada UK Japan Mexico Extra,"Machine learning systems deployed in the wild are often trained on a source distribution but deployed on a different target distribution. Unlabeled data can be a powerful point of leverage for mitigating these distribution shifts, as it is frequently much more available than labeled data and can often be obtained from distributions beyond the source distribution as well. However, existing distribution shift benchmarks with unlabeled data do not reflect the breadth of scenarios that arise in real-world applications. In this work, we present the WILDS 2.0 update, which extends 8 of the 10 datasets in the WILDS benchmark of distribution shifts to include curated unlabeled data that would be realistically obtainable in deployment. These datasets span a wide range of applications (from histology to wildlife conservation), tasks (classification, regression, and detection), and modalities (photos, satellite images, microscope slides, text, molecular graphs). The update maintains consistency with the original WILDS benchmark by using identical labeled training, validation, and test sets, as well as identical evaluation metrics. We systematically benchmark state-of-the-art methods that use unlabeled data, including domain-invariant, self-training, and self-supervised methods, and show that their success on WILDS is limited. To facilitate method development, we provide an open-source package that automates data loading and contains the model architectures and methods used in this paper.

The objective is to identify the proportion of domestic value-added (DVA) that each country exports and the type of participation of each one in the region’s value chains. A value-added input-output model was employed using interregional matrices from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for the years under analysis.

"Historical Aspects of Herbal Use and Comparison of Current Regulations of Herbal Products between Mexico, Canada and the United States of America","Increased life expectancy and high costs of medicines and medical care have led to the use of herbal products. However, these items may contain toxic compounds that have an impact on public health. We will focus on the regulatory aspects and differences of these products marketed in the North American region (USA-Mexico-Canada) from government websites and selected literature. Mexico has an ancestral tradition of using plants for the treatment, improvement, and maintenance of human health as compared with Canada and the USA Currently, the use of herbal products in this region has a regulatory framework. The legal framework in these three countries is related to their history, idiosyncrasies, socio-economic and cultural aspects. Therefore, there are different public policies for herbal products consumed in the region. Mexico has a more specific classification of these products. In Canada, all herbal products are classified as natural health products and the safety and efficacy must be scientifically proven. In the USA, the development of botanical drugs is very recent. In particular, both herbal products classified as food supplements in Mexico and dietary supplements in the USA may have risks in both safety and efficacy.",2022,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a42922a31a765c93ab8ce327a7f9d975091fc361,a42922a31a765c93ab8ce327a7f9d975091fc361,"[{'authorId': '2487991', 'name': 'P.

"Claims and Reality of New Museology: Case Studies in Canada, the United States and Mexico","In my work, I like to go back to the source, and I love those moments when we come across historical documents that prefigure, spark or express ideas very similar to those we are developing now, with the sense of breaking new ground... Suddenly we’re not alone anymore. In fact, we’re in good company.
This doctoral dissertation, originally published in 1988, could almost be considered a historical document today. I reread the opening sentence: a 1985 quote from Hugues de Varine on the museum as a perfect tool for social transformation. Decades have since gone by. New museology has become sociomuseology and various other kinds of community-oriented museologies: participative, collaborative, relational, engaged, even activist… And yet the question of the social role of museums is timelier than ever, discussed and debated at all levels of contemporary museum practice.
(…)
For several years now, new museology has, in its current adaptations, experienced a significant revival. In many countries, museums are exploring and practicing participatory museologies in collaboration with their communities. These approaches are part of a great and ongoing societal transformation: the creation of a true cultural democracy based on the principles of equity, diversity and inclusion. Against the backdrop of shifting cultural and power relations, many museums are developing innovative approaches not only to reflect these new realities, but to become agents of change, involved in the construction of new social imaginaries that engage a plurality of voices.
 How can museums do more to contribute to social and cultural justice, economic development, individual and collective well-being and a sustainable future? What real impact can they have on individuals and communities? Can they change the world? The questions that have concerned me for so long are as resonant now as they were four decades ago. I hope this text will be “good company” for today’s museum professionals.

Hard Times: The United States and Mexico in NAFTA’s “Renegotiation” Process,"Abstract After a tense process of renegotiating the terms of the NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement), the governments of the United States, Mexico and Canada established a new regional agreement, the USMCA (United States, Mexico and Canada Agreement), whose purpose is to overcome problems that emerged since the NAFTA came into force in 1994. The ratification of this document by the national congresses of the referred countries has generated new tensions and instabilities in their political scenario, especially due to the existing structural asymmetries between them. This work aims to analyse the impact of that imbalance in the NAFTA renegotiation process, considering the behaviour of the United States in relation to its partners, especially Mexico.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0c557a718d4414fa7aaf66c3d13f75ec8ab4d70,e0c557a718d4414fa7aaf66c3d13f75ec8ab4d70,"[{'authorId': '15679284', 'name': 'R.

Does the current political environment open promising directions in the complex Mexico-United States economic integration?,"Alicia Puyana Mutis FLACSO José Romero El Colegio de México Abastract In September 2021 took place the first anniversary of the Mexico, United States and Canada Trade Agreement, T-MEC, by its Spanish acronym, with the progressive heads of state of those countries, which adhere to distributive policies, the defense of workers ́ rights, ethnic minorities, women and children. These leaders represent a political shift visa-vis their predecessors and the economic model of the last three decades, when the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA, was instrumented, with austerity policies, Change of the PRI by the PAN in the presidency of the republic and total continuity in economic policies. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affected economic agendas and the implementation and development of T-MEC, thus invalidating any type of evaluation. This article focuses on political change in the USA and opportunities therein for Mexico, as of the recent trade exchange structure, in which China has played and plays an important role.

The United States - Mexico Relations in the Context of the USMCA Agreement Ratification,"The research is devoted to the consideration of the US-Mexican relations in the context of ratification of a new trilateral US - Mexico - Canada trade agreement - USMCA, that replaced NAFTA. Since the end of 2018, after the singing of USMCA and the general elections of Mexican President, the US-Mexican relations during 2019 developed under challenging conditions of political confrontation, which consisted in the pressure of US president D. Trump Administration and the US Congress on the Mexican government to include additional conditions in the agreement, related to the Mexican workers’ salary, new rules of origin for Mexican goods, customs duties on steel and aluminium, evaluation of the cost of pharmaceutical products, the increase in environmental standards, as well as the inclusion of government measures to stop transit migration from Central America to the USA through Mexican territory. These innovations in bilateral relations determine the relevance of this article. The purpose of the study is to assess the changes that have occurred in the bilateral relations while the states were discussing the terms of USMCA agreement and the first two years of its application. As a method, a comparative analysis of texts was used, including interim negotiations results between the heads of states, trade representatives, and the representatives of the Mexican Foreign Ministry and the US State Department, texts of speeches by parliamentarians, and materials from the American and Mexican media. The article highlights the changes in the US-Mexican relations during 2019-2021 after USMCA ratification, and provides the author’s forecast of their development in the near future, considering the strict American trade requirements to Mexico that formed in the process. The author comes to the conclusion that the United States will be guided by its own interests and may unfairly fulfil some of the conditions of USMCA agreement.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3af0eaf41328839dbd8adad35d61b157db76f78b,3af0eaf41328839dbd8adad35d61b157db76f78b,"[{'authorId': '91438987', 'name': 'I.

"Perceptions on trade of cultural goods in Mexico, United States And Ukraine","This research paper seeks to answer the question of what are the perceptions of trade in cultural property in the USA, Mexico and Ukraine? For this, this paper analyzes the importance of the trade of cultural goods, which cultural goods are the most important for each country, which countries they receive the majority of cultural goods from, and the perception that some nationals of these kind of goods have. This research uses the qualitative method, so I am going to aim describing contextual real-world knowledge about the behavior, social structures and shared beliefs of a specific group of people, in this case about three different cultures: USA, Mexico and Ukraine. This method will be based on interviews, participant observation and existing data, mainly based on Hofstede dimensions. This paper has found out USA perceptions as open to the export of cultural goods, but a little closed to imports in this kind of goods due to they prefer to support local goods; Mexico perceptions show an open thinking about imports and exports of cultural goods, while they maintain their cultural traditions; and finally, Ukraine perceptions show a good reaction for trade on cultural goods, but they still feel a kind of threat for their own culture.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/786ab5307cde9c56913a6d0673f1c2ee7ffbd65a,786ab5307cde9c56913a6d0673f1c2ee7ffbd65a,"[{'authorId': '2288000284', 'name': 'María Fernanda Silva Peñaloza'}, {'authorId': '2288007861', 'name': 'Robert Ojeda Pérez'}]"

Rabies surveillance in the United States during 2020.,"OBJECTIVE
To provide epidemiological information on animal and human cases of rabies in the US during 2020 and summaries of 2020 rabies surveillance for Canada and Mexico.


ANIMALS
All animals submitted for laboratory diagnosis of rabies in the US during 2020.


PROCEDURES
State and territorial public health departments and USDA Wildlife Services provided 2020 rabies surveillance data. Data were analyzed temporally and geographically to assess trends in domestic and wildlife rabies cases.


RESULTS
During 2020, 54 jurisdictions submitted 87,895 animal samples for rabies testing, of which 85,483 (97.3%) had a conclusive (positive or negative) test result. Of these, 4,479 (5.2%) tested positive for rabies, representing a 4.5% decrease from the 4,690 cases reported in 2019. Texas (n = 580 [12.9%]), Pennsylvania (371 [8.3%]), Virginia (351 [7.8%]), New York (346 [7.7%]), North Carolina (301 [6.7%]), New Jersey (257 [5.7%]), Maryland (256 [5.7%]), and California (248 [5.5%]) together accounted for > 60% of all animal rabies cases reported in 2020. Of the total reported rabid animals, 4,090 (91.3%) involved wildlife, with raccoons (n = 1,403 [31.3%]), bats (1,400 [31.3%]), skunks (846 [18.9%]), and foxes (338 [7.5%]) representing the primary hosts confirmed with rabies. Rabid cats (288 [6.4%]), cattle (43 [1.0%]), and dogs (37 [0.8%]) accounted for 95% of rabies cases involving domestic animals in 2020. No human rabies cases were reported in 2020.


CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
For the first time since 2006, the number of samples submitted for rabies testing in the US was < 90,000; this is thought to be due to factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as similar decreases in sample submission were also reported by Canada and Mexico.",2022,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/31ae3fc91c7736dfa0b61dc4196b6f9fe3a85716,31ae3fc91c7736dfa0b61dc4196b6f9fe3a85716,"[{'authorId': '93646026', 'name': 'Xiaoyue Ma'}, {'authorId': '118345854', 'name': 'Sarah Bonaparte'}, {'authorId': '2164237824', 'name': 'Matthew Toro'}, {'authorId': '4216439', 'name': 'L.

Commercial dynamics of mexican tomato in the framework of the USMCA: an analysis of trade with the united states using the gravity model,"Objective: Within the framework of the treaty between Mexico, the United States and Canada (USMCA), the objective of this study is to provide a description through econometric methods of the variables that influence tomato trade, in addition to describing the commercial dynamics of the sector in both Mexico and the United States.
Design / Methodology / Approach: A gravity model was applied to investigate and evaluate the role of some of the main economic and geographic variables as determinants of Mexican trade flows.
Results: The results show that the most important variables are the US gross national income per capita (GNIPC), as well as the US per capita production and consumption volumes calculated from apparent national consumption (ANC). It was also found that the variable GNIPC is better to determine the model than the gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC), due to the qualities of the variables.
Limitations / Implications: Statistical records for the period 1994 to 2020 were taken into account, considering all varieties of tomato produced and exported.
Findings / Conclusions: Regarding income, the variable with the best fit in the model was in GNIPC, which was adopted in the World Bank’s current way of classifying countries by income, variables such as consumption and production behaved in a typical way increasing and decreasing the volume traded. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) is one of the most competitive and profitable agricultural products in Mexico.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a69036ef694f2d9c7099895829eab7f45693c759,a69036ef694f2d9c7099895829eab7f45693c759,"[{'authorId': '2164832169', 'name': 'Carlos Ernesto Luquez Gaitan'}, {'authorId': '2122572414', 'name': 'Natividad Hernández-Mendoza'}, {'authorId': '2122563579', 'name': 'A.

1689. In Vitro Activity of Lefamulin Against Bacterial Pathogens Collected From Pneumonia Patients in United States and Latin America Medical Centers in 2020-2021,"
 
 
 Lefamulin is a novel pleuromutilin protein synthesis inhibitor approved in the US, Canada, and Europe for the oral and intravenous treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults due to typical and atypical pathogens. This study evaluated the in vitro activity of lefamulin and comparators against bacterial isolates from patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infections and hospitalized patients with pneumonia in the US and Latin America.
 
 
 
 1,907 unique isolates were collected within the SENTRY surveillance program from 29 medical centers in the US and 8 medical centers in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Panama). Isolates were susceptibility tested by CLSI reference broth microdilution methods. CLSI breakpoints (M100, 2022) were applied.
 
 
 
 Lefamulin inhibited 100% of S. pneumoniae isolates at or below its susceptible (S) breakpoint of ≤ 0.5 mg/L, regardless of resistance to other antibiotics used to treat CABP (MIC90 values of 0.12 or 0.25 mg/L, Table). The penicillin-resistant (R; 12.7%), azithromycin-R (43.7%), and tetracycline-R S. pneumoniae (20.4%) displayed reduced susceptibility to the other CABP drugs tested, except moxifloxacin ( > 98.2% S) and lefamulin (100% S). Lefamulin was highly potent against S. aureus, including MRSA, azithromycin-R, and moxifloxacin-R isolates, with 100% of isolates inhibited at or below the lefamulin S breakpoint of ≤ 0.25 mg/L. Susceptibility to azithromycin and moxifloxacin was particularly low for MRSA (13.9% and 25.0%, respectively). The fastidious Gram-negative H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, of which 24.0% and 98.8%, respectively, were ß-lactamase positive, were S to lefamulin ( > 93%) and the other tested CABP drugs ( > 89%). Table.
 Susceptibility of pneumonia pathogens from US and Latin America to lefamulin and other CABP drugs
 
 
 
 Lefamulin displayed potent in vitro activity against contemporary CABP pathogens from the US and Latin America. Its activity was unaffected by resistance to other antibiotic classes, including fluoroquinolones, macrolides, β-lactams, and tetracyclines. Lefamulin represents a valuable empiric treatment option for ambulatory and hospitalized patients with CABP, particularly when the causative pathogen is not identified or in settings with high prevalence of resistance.

The Doctrinal Foundations of the Change in U.S. Foreign Policy During Trump’s Presidency: Mexico and Canada,"Introduction. The research’s subject is the foreign policy’s theoretical foundations of D. Trump’s presidential administration in 2016–2020, which consist in changing the principles’ use of American liberal internationalism to the conservative nationalism’s principles under the motto which is called “Make America Great Again”. The theoretical approaches’ basis of intergovernmental interaction in the field of politics, economics and migration is considered on the example of relations between the United States, Canada and Mexico. The work’s purpose is to identify the doctrinal basis of D. Trump administration’s foreign policy and the impact of the adopted foreign policy settings on changes in intergovernmental interaction in the international arena. Methods. The theoretical bases’ methodology for the doctrinal provisions development of the U.S. foreign policy during the D. Trump’s administration was to use behavioral approach and special methods of political analysis. There were no major analytical studies on this topic at the time of writing. Therefore, the author of the article used the materials for his research from Russian and American scientific and periodical journals for 2019–2020. Analysis. The publications’ analysis by domestic and American authors has shown that the change in the U.S. foreign policy during the D. Trump’s presidency is due not so much to the personal qualities of the U.S. President, as some researchers believe, but to the objective conditions of the world process, where the United States want to but they can’t bear the burden of the world leader in the conditions of significant growth of other global power centers. Results. The author’s analysis of intergovernmental interaction between the United States, Canada and Mexico has shown the chosen path of using the conservative nationalism’s principles in relations with their closest allies is not so much due to the personal qualities of D. Trump how many objective changes taking place in the world political process, which led to an increase in mutual contradictions between these states. Overall, the author argues that the choice of a conservative nationalism’s policy in American foreign policy is associated with the crisis of liberal democracy.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ffceefbf3fcfff28df7527b568638c11b5230107,ffceefbf3fcfff28df7527b568638c11b5230107,"[{'authorId': '91438987', 'name': 'I.

"Incidence, prevalence, and timing of postpartum complications and mortality in Canada and the United States: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.","OBJECTIVE
The goal of this systematic review is to assess the incidence, prevalence, and timing of common postpartum (up to one year after delivery) medical, surgical/procedural, and psychosocial complications and mortality.


INTRODUCTION
Childbirth is the most common cause for hospitalization, and cesarean delivery is the most commonly performed inpatient surgery. After delivery, mothers are at risk of short- and long-term complications that can impact their well-being. The results of this review will inform evidence-based recommendations for patient education, monitoring, and follow-up.


INCLUSION CRITERIA
We will include studies performed in Canada and/or the United States that report the incidence or prevalence of medical, procedural/surgical, and psychosocial complications within one year postpartum. Observational studies (analytical cross-sectional studies, retrospective and prospective cohorts), randomized or non-randomized controlled trials with a control or standard of care group, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses will be included. Studies with <100 patients, age <18 years, no reporting of duration, and focus on patients with a specific condition rather than a general postpartum population will be excluded.


METHODS
The search strategy was co-developed with a medical librarian and included full-text English-language articles published within the past 10 years (2011-2021) in PubMed, CINHAL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Screening, critical appraisal, and data extraction will be performed by two independent reviewers using Covidence, standardized JBI tools, and a standardized form, respectively. For each complication, the incidence or prevalence, timing of the frequency measurement, and duration of follow-up from individual studies will be determined. Meta-analysis will be performed if feasible.

"Trends, periodicities and ENSO relationships of the annual precipitation over the contiguous United States and Southern Canada","The century-long (1891-1990) time series of Groisman and Easterling (1994a,b) representing estimates of annual precipitation amounts over five homogeneous regions of the United States and Southern Canada (south of 55° N) were examined for trends, periodicities and ENSO relationships. The trends were not uniformly up or down during the 100-year interval, for any region. From 1891 to about 1930, the trends were downward or negligible. Thereafter, the trends were mostly upward, with cyclic variations superposed. A spectral analysis revealed significant periodicities in the QBO and QTO regions (2-3 years and 3-4 years) as also higher periodicities, some common to all regions and hence seen in the series for the entire region. To study the ENSO relationship, a finer classification of El Nino events was used. Each year was examined to check whether it had an El Nino (EN) and/or a Southern Oscillation Index SOI minimum (SO) and/or warm (W) or cold (C) equatorial eastern Pacific sea surface temperatures SST. Several years were ENSOW, which were further subdivided into two groups viz. Unambiguous ENSOW where El Nino existed and SOI minima and SST maxima were in the middle of the calendar year (May-Aug) and, Ambiguous ENSOW where El Nino existed but the SOI minima and SST maxima were in the early or late part of the calendar year, not in the middle. Other El Nino events were of the type ENSO, ENW, ENC, EN. For the All India summer monsoon rainfall, Unambiguous ENSOW were overwhelmingly associated with droughts. For the rainfall in USA and Canada, relationships were not clear-cut except in the Gulf-Mexico region and some other parts. For these regions, excess rains were associated better with the Unambiguous ENSOW.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4bcf9345c00532ba0980389c1ec4e0ddbdc64a35,4bcf9345c00532ba0980389c1ec4e0ddbdc64a35,"[{'authorId': '145886198', 'name': 'R.

"Tick Control in a Connected World: Challenges, Solutions, and Public Policy from a United States Border Perspective","Ticks are able to transmit the highest number of pathogen species of any blood-feeding arthropod and represent a growing threat to public health and agricultural systems worldwide. While there are numerous and varied causes and effects of changes to tick-borne disease (re)emergence, three primary challenges to tick control were identified in this review from a U.S. borders perspective. (1) Climate change is implicated in current and future alterations to geographic ranges and population densities of tick species, pathogens they can transmit, and their host and reservoir species, as highlighted by Ixodes scapularis and its expansion across southern Canada. (2) Modern technological advances have created an increasingly interconnected world, contributing to an increase in invasive tick species introductions through the increased speed and frequency of trade and travel. The introduction of the invasive Haemaphysalis longicornis in the eastern U.S. exemplifies the challenges with control in a highly interconnected world. (3) Lastly, while not a new challenge, differences in disease surveillance, control, and management strategies in bordering countries remains a critical challenge in managing ticks and tick-borne diseases. International inter-agency collaborations along the U.S.–Mexico border have been critical in control and mitigation of cattle fever ticks (Rhipicephalus spp.) and highlight the need for continued collaboration and research into integrated tick management strategies.

First Report of Powdery Mildew of American Ginseng Caused by Erysiphe heraclei in Tennessee and the United States.,"American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.), native to the forested regions of northeast U.S is a perennial herb valued as traditional Chinese medicine. It has been cultivated in North America for several decades due to high global demand. Powdery mildew symptoms were observed on 8-year-old cultivated American ginseng leaves (Fig. 1a, b) on a residential property in Rutherford Co., TN in May 2022. Disease severity was 40 to 60% of leaf area and incidence was 33% out of 30 plants. Affected plants exhibited white fungal colonies on the leaves. Under severe infection, the leaves were chlorotic and senescing. Microscopic observation revealed masses of conidia and mycelia on symptomatic tissue. Conidiophores were cylindrical and unbranched (2- or, rarely, 3-septate), measuring 66.7 ± 12.5 μm (n=78) with a range of 24.3 to 90.7 μm. Conidia produced singly or in pseudo-chains (Fig. 1c). Conidiophore foot cells measured 23.2 ± 4.3 μm long (n=54) and the width at the foot cell septum was 5.1 ± 0.6 μm (n=54). Hyphal width was 3.3 ± 0.6 um (n=59). Fresh vacuolated spores were oblong-elliptical to oblong (Fig. 1d) and measured 31.5 × 11.9 μm (n=55), lacked fibrosin bodies. The length-to-width ratio of conidia was 1.9 to 4.4 (avg. 2.7). Superficial mycelia and germinating spores displayed lobed appressorium (Fig. 1e). Detached spore surfaces were wrinkled (Fig. 1f). Morphological characteristics of the fungus matched the description of Erysiphe heraclei (Braun and Cook, 2012) and Erysiphe sp. (Cho et al. 2016) except for conidiophore length, which was shorter in our sample. To confirm pathogen identity, total DNA was extracted directly from single spore cultures (isolates FBG1668 and FBG1728). The ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified using ITS4 and ITS5 primers (White et al. 1990). The sequences (GenBank accession nos. OP458196 and OP469994) showed 100% identity and 100% query coverage to E. heraclei (KY073878 and LC270862). The sequences were also 100% identical to the ITS sequences of E. betae and E. malvae. Solano-Báez et al. (2022) noted that the species in the E. malvae/E. heraclei/E. betae species complex are phylogenetically undistinguishable. E. betae and E. malvae infect plants in Chenopodiaceae and Malvaceae, respectively (Braun and Cook, 2012). However, E. heraclei has been reported to infect plants in Apiaceae. American ginseng belongs to Araliaceae which is a close family to Apiaceae and both belong to Apiales. Based on morphological and molecular identification, both isolates were identified as E. heraclei. Pathogenicity was confirmed by inoculating the adaxial leaf surface of six 2-year-old American ginseng plants. Spores from detached symptomatic leaves were tapped onto the adaxial surface of healthy leaves. Six non-inoculated and inoculated plants were maintained in a greenhouse at 21 to 23°C, 70%RH, with 16-h photoperiod. After 2 weeks, powdery mildew symptoms developed on the inoculated plants. The microscopy and molecular analysis confirmed infection and all control plants remained asymptomatic. Cho et al. (2016) reported powdery mildew on Korean ginseng (P. ginseng C.A. Mey) caused by Erysiphe sp., and Sholberg et al. (1996) reported Erysiphe sp. on P. quinquefolius in Canada, but to our knowledge, this is the first report of powdery mildew caused by E. heraclei on American ginseng in Tennessee and the U.S. Identification and timely management of powdery mildew on American ginseng will be necessary to control this disease in affected growing sites.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/198c7892e0940fd98c483d4f0d954e71f8ce768e,198c7892e0940fd98c483d4f0d954e71f8ce768e,"[{'authorId': '6215226', 'name': 'F.

Racial/Ethnic Heterogeneity in Diet of Low-income Adult Women in the United States: Results from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2011-2018,"Background. Poor diet is a major risk factor of cardiovascular and chronic diseases, particularly for low-income women. However, the pathways by which race/ethnicity plays a role in this risk factor have not been fully explored. Objective. This observational study aims to identify dietary consumption differences by race/ethnicity of US women living at or below the 130% poverty income level from 2011-2018. Design. A total of 3005 adult women aged 20-80 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2011-2018) living at or below the 130% poverty-income level with at least one complete 24-hr dietary recall were classified into 5 self-identified racial/ethnic subgroups (Mexican, Other Hispanic, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Asian). Dietary consumption patterns were defined by 29 major food groups summarized from the Food Pattern Equivalents Database and derived via a robust profile clustering model which identifies foods that share consumption patterns across all low-income adult women, and foods that differ in consumption patterns based on race/ethnic subgroups. Results. Legumes (protein and vegetable) were the most differentiating foods identified across all racial/ethnic subgroups and were primarily consumed by Mexican and Other Hispanic women. Non-Hispanic Asian women were most likely to favor a high consumption of prudent foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains). Non-Hispanic White and Black women shared the most similarities in consumption patterns but differed in foods such as milk, poultry, and eggs. Conclusions. Differences among consumption behaviors of low-income women were found along racial/ethnic lines. Efforts to improve nutritional health of low-income adult women should consider racial/ethnic differences in diet to appropriately focus interventions.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8292bec8affcffec1ce6e8bc4da125fbf5fcc4c,a8292bec8affcffec1ce6e8bc4da125fbf5fcc4c,"[{'authorId': '4030676', 'name': 'B.

The Labor Force Trajectories of Immigrant Women in the United States: Intersecting Individual and Gendered Cohort Characteristics,"Research on immigrant women's labor market incorporation has increased in recent years, yet systematic comparisons of employment trajectories by national origin and over time remain rare. Likewise, the literature on immigrant assimilation remains dominated by attention to men, with little focus on larger gendered migration dynamics. Using US Census and ACS data from 1990 to 2016, we construct synthetic migration cohorts by national/regional origin, period, and age at arrival to track immigrant women's labor force participation (LFP) over time. We propose and model a typology of workforce incorporation, adjusting for individual characteristics and gendered migration-cohort characteristics (i.e., the gender ratio, share of women arriving single, and share of men arriving with a college education). Results indicate that immigrant women gradually join the workforce over time, though with significant variation in starting employment levels and growth rates. We classify the observed patterns into a five-group typology: Gradual incorporation (cohorts from Europe, Canada, Africa, China, and Vietnam), delayed incorporation with low entry LFP level (cohorts from Mexico), delayed incorporation with moderate entry LFP level (cohorts from Central America, South America, and Cuba), accelerated incorporation (cohorts from India, Korea, and other Asian countries), and continuous intensive employment (cohorts from the Philippines and the Caribbean). We show that gendered migration cohort characteristics explain a substantial share of national/regional origin variation in immigrant women's workforce participation, highlighting the importance of broader cultural and structural forces shaping gendered patterns of immigrant labor market incorporation.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/be4e4f7732ff441002cc57a8a1483d7b137fb4d4,be4e4f7732ff441002cc57a8a1483d7b137fb4d4,"[{'authorId': '40914878', 'name': 'Sandra Florian'}, {'authorId': '12006412', 'name': 'C.

Origin of Moisture for the Precipitation Produced by the Exceptional Winter Storm Formed over the Gulf of Mexico in March 1993,"On 12–15 March 1993, a severe winter storm (SC93) formed over the Gulf of Mexico, affecting the Caribbean Islands and the eastern coast of the United States (US) and Canada with a notable amount of precipitation, snow and severe local storms. In this study, we investigate the origin of the precipitation generated by SC93 by applying a widely used Lagrangian moisture source diagnostic method. Our findings revealed that most of the moisture came from the western North Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Moreover, the eastern US and Mexico acted as notable terrestrial moisture sources. Overall, the moisture contribution from the oceanic origin was higher than the terrestrial counterpart, and the moisture sources progressively shifted northward as the storm moved. In addition, the moisture uptake mainly occurred in the cyclone–anticyclone interaction region.",2022,10,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5978b4b56ce78e0c1e609f6e18a4a03cd20e77ee,5978b4b56ce78e0c1e609f6e18a4a03cd20e77ee,"[{'authorId': '2092757439', 'name': 'Patricia Coll-Hidalgo'}, {'authorId': '2006385039', 'name': 'A.

The creative economy and its linkages in the metropolitan areas of Mexico,"ABSTRACT This paper analyses the linkages of the creative and cultural industries (CCIs) in the metropolitan areas of Mexico and identifies two regionally differentiated ‘locational-pull factors’: the city’s industrial base and amenities. These factors have been reinforced by the deconcentration of the Mexican urban system. The industrial base locational-pull factors plays an important role in cities involved in international trade with the United States/Canada, while the pull of amenities drives a different path associated with tourist and cultural enclaves. In Mexico, software and creative services (such as advertising) exhibit strong linkages within creative sectors and with other non-creative industries.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a9309ddf778223eb16ba12357e06d7057e0dd03b,a9309ddf778223eb16ba12357e06d7057e0dd03b,"[{'authorId': '112958983', 'name': 'Marcos Valdivia'}, {'authorId': '1403120735', 'name': 'L.

Updated checklist of the fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) of Mexico.,"An updated checklist of fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) from Mexico is presented. The checklist includes the following valid taxa: the subfamilies Amydetinae Olivier in Wytsman, 1907, Chespiritoinae Ferreira, Keller and Branham, 2020, Photurinae Lacordaire, 1857, Pterotinae LeConte, 1861, and Lampyrinae Rafinesque, 1815, in addition to 8 tribes (including incertae sedis), 2 subtribes, 25 genera, and 232 species. We also propose Photinus cubilguitzi Prez-Hernndez Zaragoza-Caballero nom. nov. as a replacement name for Photinus moestus (Gorham, 1884) nec Photinus moestus (Perty, 1830). At least 152 documented species (65.6% of the total) are restricted to Mexico, another 21 have also been recorded in Canada and the United States of America, and 59 in different Latin American countries. Remarkably, Photinini contains 64.6% (150 species) of the Mexican lampyrid fauna, and at least 54.7% (127 species) belong to the Photinus genus. The Mexican Transition Zone had higher Lampyridae species richness and endemism than the Nearctic and Neotropical biogeographic regions in the country, while the Transmexican Volcanic Belt, Veracruzan and Balsas Basin biogeographic provinces harbor the highest overall species richness and endemism. Veracruz and Oaxaca are the richest states in terms of lampyrid genera and species, while Aguascalientes, Quertaro and Zacatecas have only one or no species recorded each. To date, 10% of the global firefly fauna has been recorded in Mexico, and the country has a large number of endemic species.

Changes in apparent consumption of staple food in Mexico associated with the gradual implementation of the NAFTA,"In 1994, the United States, Canada, and Mexico signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to remove trade barriers and facilitate cross-border trade in goods and services. Worldwide, trade agreements, urbanization and economic development have shaped significant changes in dietary habits. This study aims to evaluate the association between the gradual implementation of NAFTA and changes in apparent consumption of staple foods in Mexico. We analyzed national apparent consumption of animal- and vegetable-source foods, using data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) from 1970 to 2018. Association between NAFTA and apparent consumption was estimated using interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) with synthetic controls and included two inflection points based on the implementation of NAFTA: 1994, when the agreement began, and 2008 when it was fully implemented. As a result, comparing Mexico with the synthetic control, we found a significant decrease in apparent consumption of pulses, -3.22 and -1.92 kcal/capita/day in the post-1994 and post-2008 periods, respectively. The vegetable-source foods showed an increase of 5.79 kcal/capita/day after 2008. The trends of apparent consumption of animal-source foods, eggs, and milk had significant increases after 1994 and 2008. The apparent consumption of meat increased only after 2008. The implementation of NAFTA was associated with an increase in apparent consumption of food from animal-source and a decrease in consumption of pulses. After 2008, an increase in apparent consumption of vegetable-source foods was observed.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a3cf2b0d0e634661e79e5a718807b247184b140c,a3cf2b0d0e634661e79e5a718807b247184b140c,"[{'authorId': '1411119966', 'name': 'Néstor A.

The political economy of a North–South trade agreement and the development prospects for Mexico: from NAFTA to USMCA,"ABSTRACT In the 1980s, Mexico switched from a policy of import substitution to export-oriented development. From 1994, it participated in a North–South free trade agreement with the United States and Canada (North American Free Trade Agreement – NAFTA). The agreement strongly reflected the asymmetric power of the three participants, although some Mexico’s regions served as production platforms in global value chains. Under NAFTA, Mexico’s overall growth was insipid, yet a trade surplus with the United States was the excuse for Donald Trump’s government to impose a renegotiation that led in 2020 to a new agreement (US, Mexico, Canada Agreement – USMCA) with terms yet more favourable to the United States. In the light of this experience and the political and economic factors that explain it, this paper studies to the need to get Mexico’s trade policies right through permanent consideration to the development needs in the country.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3079d5ee5ade93912de6b3d8423de68a6263c1c2,3079d5ee5ade93912de6b3d8423de68a6263c1c2,"[{'authorId': '1422262743', 'name': 'Alejandra Trejo-Nieto'}]"
3‐Methylcyclohex‐2‐en‐1‐one reduces the aggregation of Dendroctonus pseudotsugae barragani and corresponding mortality of Pseudotsuga menziesii in northern Mexico,"Dendroctonus pseudotsugae is the most important forest insect pest of Douglas‐fir Pseudotsuga menziesii in North America. Two subspecies of Douglas‐fir beetle are recognized: D. pseudotsugae pseudotsugae, which inhabits southwestern Canada and western United States, and Dendroctonus pseudotsugae barragani, which occurs in northern Mexico. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of 3‐methylcylohex‐2‐en‐1‐one (MCH) in reducing aggregation of D. pseudotsugae barragani, and corresponding Douglas‐fir mortality by this insect. Two field experiments were conducted: the first consisted of three doses of MCH in bubble caps (plus a control treatment) applied within 16 0.5 ha plots. The second consisted of three doses of MCH disrupt micro‐flakes (plus a control treatment) applied within 16 1.0 ha plots. MCH bubble caps at 28.8 and 44.0 g AI/ha and MCH disrupt micro‐flakes at 185.3 and 741 g AI/ha significantly reduced the aggregation of D. pseudotsugae barragani. When applying MCH as bubble caps, only the highest dose (44.0 g AI/ha) significantly reduced the number of successfully attacked trees.

Creating a Detailed Wetland Inventory with Sentinel-2 Time-Series Data and Google Earth Engine in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada,"Wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of Canada and the United States represent a unique mapping challenge. They are dynamic both seasonally and year-to-year, are very small, and frequently altered by human activity. Many efforts have been made to estimate the loss of these important habitats but a high-quality inventory of pothole wetlands is needed for data-driven conservation and management of these resources. Typical landcover classifications using one or two image dates from optical or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Earth Observation (EO) systems often produce reasonable wetland inventories for less dynamic, forested landscapes, but will miss many of the temporary and seasonal wetlands in the PPR. Past studies have attempted to capture PPR wetland dynamics by using dense image stacks of optical or SAR data. We build upon previous work, using 2017–2020 Sentinel-2 imagery processed through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to capture seasonal flooding dynamics of wetlands in a prairie pothole wetland landscape in Alberta, Canada. Using 36 different image dates, wetland flood frequency (hydroperiod) was calculated by classifying water/flooding in each image date. This product along with the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) Canopy Height Model (CHM) was then used to generate a seven-class wetland inventory with wetlands classified as areas with seasonal but not permanent water/flooding. Overall accuracies of the resulting inventory were between 95% and 96% based on comparisons with local photo-interpreted inventories at the Canadian Wetland Classification System class level, while wetlands themselves were classified with approximately 70% accuracy. The high overall accuracy is due, in part, to a dominance of uplands in the PPR. This relatively simple method of classifying water through time generates reliable wetland maps but is only applicable to ecosystems with open/non-complex wetland types and may be highly sensitive to the timing of cloud-free optical imagery that captures peak wetland flooding (usually post snow melt). Based on this work, we suggest that expensive field or photo-interpretation training data may not be needed to map wetlands in the PPR as self-labeling of flooded and non-flooded areas in a few Sentinel-2 images is sufficient to classify water through time. Our approach demonstrates a framework for the operational mapping of small, dynamic PPR wetlands that relies on open-access EO data and does not require costly, independent training data. It is an important step towards the effective conservation and management of PPR wetlands, providing an efficient method for baseline and ongoing mapping in these dynamic environments.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/191521ab9db36758fca78f1a02964001d0b0682e,191521ab9db36758fca78f1a02964001d0b0682e,"[{'authorId': '145676185', 'name': 'Evan R.

In terms of teleworking, the Federal Labor Law was modified on January 11, 2021, which highlights that the employer must cover costs proportional to the electricity and internet service used by workers. In eleven months (from March 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021) nearly 800 thousand formal jobs of IMSS contributors were lost, by October 2021 only 36 thousand jobs remained to be covered from that loss. In Mexico, due to COVID-19 in 2020, the GDP contracted 8.3%, recovering 5% by 2021. In the relationship between electronic commerce and GDP, Mexico presents 2.7% as of October 2021, the same percentage as Brazil, with countries such as Chile, Peru, Argentina and Colombia above; The United States and Canada present positions above our nation in 2.2 and 1.5 times more, respectively.

"Fiscal decentralization, federal resources and municipal public revenues in Mexico","In 1983 all municipalities in Mexico absorbed 2.6% of national public revenues, being that by 2019 it reached 6.6%, thus showing a substantial growth in 36 years. Of the total municipal public revenues, federal participations represented 37.1% in 2018 and 37.1% in 2019, while federal aportments represented 35.9% in 2018 and 35.3% in 2019; both federal resources meant 73% in 2018 and 73.8% in 2019, that is, out of every 4 pesos of revenues 3 come from the federation. In 2019, the main revenues of the municipalities that come from federal funds are: General Participation Fund (23.1%); FORTAMUN (15.2%); Social Infrastructure Aportments Fund (12.79%). The tax effort or municipal own revenues accounted for 22.6% of total municipal public revenues in 2018 and 23.1% in 2019. Property tax is the main figure of municipal own revenues, representing 47.1% and 45% respectively in 2018 and 2019.As an international comparison point property tax related to GDP yielded these figures: France 4.03%, Great Britain 4.08%, Canada 3.87%, United States 2.96%, Spain 2.43%, Colombia 1.79%, Chile 1.12% and Mexico only 0.33% of GDP; appreciating a very low percentage in relation to the two Latin American nations and much lower compared to developed countries.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a3622f4e7c135be487ef0e0074caeee32b81d78b,a3622f4e7c135be487ef0e0074caeee32b81d78b,"[{'authorId': '2179227224', 'name': 'José Antonio Villalobos López'}]"

China's foreign direct investment in Mexico's auto parts-automotive industry:,"In 2020 China displaced the United States as the main country of origin of cross-border M&A type investments and ranked fourth as the origin of new greenfield projects. In the regional context, since 2010 Mexico appears as the second destination of Chinese direct investment directed to manufacturing and as the first destination in the automotive auto parts industry (AAI). The article examines the determinants of Chinese direct investment in Mexico from a regional perspective and from the case study of the Chinese multinational Minth based on Aguascalientes, Mexico. The results allow us to conclude that the growing presence of direct investment by Chinese private companies in the AAI is explained by the favorable prospects for demand generated by the presence of global assemblers in Mexico and geographic and institutional variables such as the proximity whit United States, the agglomeration economies presence and benefits of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a9c2537b977197447fb5c19501205543703bf58c,a9c2537b977197447fb5c19501205543703bf58c,"[{'authorId': '2171059598', 'name': 'Samuel Ortiz Velásquez'}, {'authorId': '2171059036', 'name': 'Jaime Alberto Prudencio Vazquez'}]"
Policy Forum: Trade Policy Pain for Marginal Climate Gain? The Complex Case for Border Carbon Adjustments in Canada,"Spurred by a 2021 commitment by the European Union to adopt a carbon border adjustment mechanism to address carbon leakage in international trade, developed economies are giving such proposals serious consideration. This article considers the arguments for and against a border carbon adjustment (BCA) for Canada, considering the likely treatment of such measures by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and under Canada's major trade agreements with the European Union, the United States and Mexico, and Indo-Pacific partners. The authors analyze the likely impact of a BCA on carbon-intensive trade between Canada and these trading partners. They conclude that while a carefully designed Canadian BCA could be both WTO-legal and permissible under Canada's major trade agreements, serious political and economic challenges are likely to arise. Since BCAs are by nature protectionist, proponents must advance a stronger case for their effectiveness in addressing global carbon emissions if these mechanisms are to be widely adopted.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1654aae2a8a8b716dcf49da33c661a39511238b6,1654aae2a8a8b716dcf49da33c661a39511238b6,"[{'authorId': '34594802', 'name': 'Meredith Lilly'}, {'authorId': '6866129', 'name': 'Emily M.

Teacher Educators’ Apprenticeships of Observation and Community-Based Field Settings,"This paper presents findings from a 2-year collaborative self-study examining four teacher educators’ (TEs’) experiences facilitating community-based field experiences in the United States and Canada. To examine our experiences working in these field settings we drew experiential learning theory (ELT) as well as the concept of apprenticeship of observation. Facilitating preservice teachers’ (PSTs) learning in field settings outside traditional PK-12 contexts, such as museums and a construction site, prompted us to consider how apprenticeships of observation and ELT intersect when seeking to expand PST education to also include community-based field settings. Working in these community-based field settings also served to disrupt some of our own apprenticeships of observation.

The First Challenge to Canada’s Supply Management System under CUSMA: Tweaking the Supply Management System One Dispute at a Time,"Abstract In 2021, the United States challenged Canadian dairy import tariff rate quotas (TRQs) before the first state-to-state arbitration panel under Chapter 31 of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA). The panel held that the method of allocation of TRQs limited the US dairy industry’s access to the Canadian market and therefore violated CUSMA provisions. However, the panel also acknowledged that the Canadian supply management system for dairy products is a unique regulatory framework for production control, pricing mechanisms, and import control. This article explores the case as a test of the functioning of the improved CUSMA dispute settlement process and of Canada’s ability to protect its supply management system for dairy products from renewed pressure coming from its most important trade partner.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bb72a2e75f57f35b8bda3dfdf28181ca877ff9cc,bb72a2e75f57f35b8bda3dfdf28181ca877ff9cc,"[{'authorId': '2034411', 'name': 'L.

FOREIGN POLICY OF CANADA AT THE PRESENT STAGE: PECULIARITIES OF INTERACTION WITH KEY PARTNERS,"Ключові слова: Канада, зовнішня політика, США, Велика Британія, Мексика, СUSMA. The article is devoted to the comprehensive research of foreign policy of Canada at the modern stage. The article is aimed to research and analyze the peculiarities of the realization of foreign policy of Canada. In this article, the authors consider the main features of Canada’s foreign policy at the current stage, taking into account new reality. The authors focus on the main aspects of Canada’s foreign policy, namely the explanation of the concept of the “middle power”, usage of “soft power”, and relations with the United States, Mexico, and Great Britain. Canada-US relations as one of the most prominent are analyzed from the economic and security points of view. It is shown that these two countries maintain close relations in these spheres through the system of bilateral agreements and partnerships. Also, Canada and the USA have a special security program, aimed at the protection of aerospace territory. CanadaUK relations are characterized as constantly developing. Canada-Mexico relations are based on both bilateral and multilateral agreements, such as CUSMA, and bilateral agreements. Cooperation with Mexico plays an important role in Canadian foreign politics. In relations with the United States and Mexico, CUSMA (Canada-United StatesMexico) agreement plays an important role, which forms the basis of economic relations between these countries at the current stage. In relations with Great Britain, the Agreement on Continuity of Trade between Canada and Great Britain plays an important role. Canada’s interaction with mentioned countries in international agreements and joint projects is also highlighted in the article. Particular attention is paid to Canada’s participation in international organizations, namely NATO and the United Nations, and Canada's role in the activities of these organizations. As an active member of both these international organizations, Canada is actively involved in special activities devoted to helping those countries, that are suffering due to different reasons, or promoting ideas of peace and stability in regions, that are in or after the conflict period.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc91d38f434de539cb6903cfd24d86dd4569a5e3,dc91d38f434de539cb6903cfd24d86dd4569a5e3,"[{'authorId': '2146591159', 'name': 'H.

Adolescents’ media usage and self-reported exposure to advertising across six countries: implications for less healthy food and beverage marketing,"Objectives The study objectives were to examine: (1) adolescents’ media viewing habits, (2) associations with media viewing and self-reported exposure to unhealthy food and beverage advertising and (3) differences in trends among younger and older adolescents in six high and upper middle-income countries. Design Repeat cross-sectional online survey. Setting Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA). Participants Respondents to the International Food Policy Study who provided information on all variables of interest in November–December 2019 aged 10–17 years (n=9171). Outcome measures Self-reported exposure to screen-based media (screen time by media channel), use of social media platforms and self-reported location and frequency of exposure to unhealthy food and beverage advertising. Results The average amount of time spent in front of various screens ranged from 7.6 hours to 10.2 hours across countries per week day, which may include possible viewing of multiple media channels simultaneously. Overall, Instagram was the most popular social media platform (52%–68% by country), followed by Facebook (42%–79%) and Snapchat (28%–52%). The percentage of respondents who self-reported having seen unhealthy food advertisements in the past 30 days was highest on television (43%–69%), followed by digital media (27%–60%) and gaming applications (10%–17%). Self-reported daily exposure to advertising varied between countries for sugary drinks (10%–43%) and fast food (19%–44%) and was positively associated with self-reported screen time. Self-reported exposure to screen-based media and social media platforms differed by sociodemographic characteristics and was higher among older adolescents than younger adolescents.

Diversity of Nearctic Dragonflies and Damselflies (Odonata),"Rarely have studies assessed Odonata diversity for the entire Nearctic realm by including Canada, the United States, and Mexico. For the first time, we explored Odonata diversity in this region according to a definition of natural community assemblages and generated species distribution models (SDMs). Species occurrence data were assembled by reviewing databases of specimens held by significant Odonata repositories and through an extensive search of literature references. Species were categorized as forest-dependent or non-forest-dependent, as lentic or lotic-dependent, and according to conservation status. Predicted distributions were stacked for all species across their entire ranges, including areas outside of the Nearctic. Species richness and corrected weighted endemism (CWE) were then calculated for each grid cell. We found a pattern of greater species richness in the eastern portion of the Nearctic, which can be explained by the higher aquatic habitat diversity at micro and macroscales east of the Rocky Mountains, promoting niche partitioning and specialization. In the Nearctic region, the southeastern US has the highest number of endemic species of dragonflies and damselflies; this degree of endemism is likely due to glacial refuges providing a foundation for the evolution of a rich and unique biota.",2022,16,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fd3f49918a99f7855817d2f27a79eb9403c7c25d,fd3f49918a99f7855817d2f27a79eb9403c7c25d,"[{'authorId': '46550727', 'name': 'John C.

The Conceptual Framework for the International Food Policy Study: Evaluating the population-level Impact of Food Policy.,"An unhealthy diet is among the leading global causes of death and disability. Globally, a range of policies are being implemented to support healthy food choices at a population level, including novel polices in the areas of food marketing, nutrition labelling, and taxation of less healthy foods. There is a need to evaluate and inform the implementation of these policies, including their impact on marginalized population subgroups. The International Food Policy Study (IFPS) consists of repeated cross-sectional surveys conducted in five high and upper-middle income countries: Australia, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In each country, approximately 4000 adults and 1200 children and youth (aged 10-17) were recruited from a global commercial panel to complete an online survey using consistent measures and methodologies across countries. The first annual IFPS surveys were conducted in 2017 with adults; annual surveys for young people aged 10-17 were launched in 2019 in the same countries, as well as Chile. The design of the IFPS surveys creates a framework for evaluating 'natural experiments' in food policies, including comparisons over time within countries implementing the policy, and comparisons with countries in which the policy was not implemented. IFPS surveys have three primary areas of focus: 1) knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs associated with specific policies; 2) diet-related behaviours; and 3) dietary intake, including 24-hour dietary recalls for adults in four of five countries. Surveys also assess food insecurity, income adequacy, sex and gender, race/ethnicity and a range of other measures to assess trends among priority subgroups. Overall, the IFPS project has the potential to address important gaps in national monitoring surveys for dietary patterns, and to evaluate the impact of novel food policies implemented in any of the five countries over the study period.",2022,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f259c1cc0fa0ece8e78aba0cb99f21d82404ae49,f259c1cc0fa0ece8e78aba0cb99f21d82404ae49,"[{'authorId': '2095416689', 'name': 'David Hammond'}, {'authorId': '4808531', 'name': 'L.

Self-Reported Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Diet-Related Behaviors and Food Security in 5 Countries: Results from the International Food Policy Study 2020,"
                  Background
                  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted many aspects of daily life, including dietary intake; however, few studies have reported its impacts on dietary behaviors and food security across multiple countries.
               
                  Objectives
                  We examined self-reported impacts of COVID-19 on food behaviors, food security, and overall diet healthfulness in 5 countries.
               
                  Methods
                  Adults aged 18–100 years (n = 20,554) in Australia, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States completed an online survey in November and December 2020 as part of the International Food Policy Study, an annual, repeat cross-sectional survey. Survey measures assessed perceived impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating food prepared away from home, having food delivered from a restaurant, and buying groceries online, as well as perceived food security and overall diet healthfulness. Regression models examined associations between each outcome and sociodemographic correlates.
               
                  Results
                  Across all countries, 62% of respondents reported eating less food prepared away from home due to the pandemic, while 11% reported eating more. Some participants reported having less food delivered from a restaurant (35%) and buying fewer groceries online (17%), while other respondents reported more of each (19% and 25%, respectively). An average of 39% reported impacts on their food security, and 27% reported healthful changes to their overall diet. The largest changes for all outcomes were observed in Mexico. Participants who were younger, ethnic minorities, or had lower income adequacy tended to be more likely to report food-related changes in either direction; however, these relationships were often less pronounced among respondents in Mexico.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Respondents reported important changes in how they sourced their food during the pandemic, with trends suggesting shifts towards less food prepared away from home and more healthful diets overall. However, changes in diet and food behaviors occurred in both healthful and less healthful directions, suggesting that dietary responses to the pandemic were highly variable.

Metalliferous Coals of Cretaceous Age: A Review,"Critical elements in coal and coal-bearing sequences (e.g., Li, Sc, V, Ga, Ge, Se, Y and rare earth elements, Zr, Nb, Au, Ag, platinum group elements, Re, and U) have attracted great attention because their concentrations in some cases may be comparable to those of conventional ore deposits. The enrichment of critical elements in coals, particularly those of Carboniferous-Permian and Cenozoic ages, have generally been attributed to within-plate (plume-related) volcanism and associated hydrothermal activity. However, Cretaceous coals are not commonly rich in critical elements, with the exception of some (e.g., Ge and U) in localised areas. This paper globally reviewed metalliferous coals from Siberia, the Russian Far East, Mongolia, South America, the United States and Mexico, Canada (Alberta and British Columbia), China, Africa, and Australasia (Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, Northern Territory, New Zealand, Nelson, West Coast, Canterbury, Otago, and Southland). The world-class Ge-U or Ge deposits in North China, Mongolia, and Siberia are the only commercially significant representatives of the Cretaceous metalliferous coals, which are related to bio-chemical reduction of oxidized meteoric, hydrothermal, or sea waters by organic matter of the peat bogs. The common Cretaceous coals worldwide are generally not rich in critical elements because intensive igneous activity led to extensive acidification of terrestrial and marine waters, which are responsible for the low coal metallogenesis during the Cretaceous period, especially the Early Cretaceous time.",2022,8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b811a69100042af911270ac63788b9bb278b19d,8b811a69100042af911270ac63788b9bb278b19d,"[{'authorId': '5209497', 'name': 'S.

"Detection of Giardia duodenalis Zoonotic Assemblages AI and BIV in Pet Prairie Dogs (Cynomys ludovicanus) in Bangkok, Thailand","Simple Summary Prairie dogs are native to the United States, Canada, and Mexico. They have been brought to Thailand and become popular as exotic pets and providing humans with exotic pets in close-contact environments. Prairie dogs have been known to carry several waterborne protozoan pathogens. One of those pathogens is known as Giardia, a flagellate protozoan parasite which can cause gastrointestinal illness in humans and other animals. This study has identified the Giardia parasite in the feces of prairie dogs. There were 13% of prairie dogs pets in Bangkok, Thailand that carried the Giardia parasite. We also found that the parasite was categorized as a human parasite. Therefore, there was potential risk that prairie dogs could contract a Giardia infection from humans as a source, and that humans could receive the parasite from their exotic pets via the fecal-oral route in shared environments. We suggest that exotic pet owners should pay more attention to effective sanitation and provide clean food and water for their exotic pets. Owners should bring their exotic pets for veterinary services and screening of zoonotic pathogens using fecal examination regularly. Treatment can successfully cure the infected pets as well as prevent the spreading of pathogen to the environment. Abstract Giardia is a flagellate protozoa that can be transmitted via direct contact and by consuming contaminated water. It is pathogenic in humans and various other animals, including exotic pets. Pet prairie dogs are popular in Thailand, but they have not been investigated regarding giardiasis. Giardia infection was measured, and genetic characterization was performed to investigate the zoonotic potential of Giardia carried by pet prairie dogs. In total, 79 fecal samples were examined from prairie dogs visiting the Kasetsart University Veterinary Teaching Hospital during 2017–2021. Simple floatation was conducted. Two Giardia-positive samples were submitted for DNA extraction, PCR targeting the Giardia ssu rRNA, tpi and gdh genes was performed, and genetic characterization using sequencing analysis was conducted. Risk factors associated with Giardia infection were analyzed. Giardia infection was found in 11 out of the 79 pet prairie dogs (13.9%). Giardia infection was significantly higher in male prairie dogs (p = 0.0345). Coccidia cysts (12.7%), the eggs of nematodes (6.3%), and amoeba cysts (2.5%) were also detected. Genetic characterization of the two Giardia-positive samples revealed that they were G. duodenalis assemblage A, sub-genotypes AI and assemblage B, and sub-genotype BIV, the zoonotic assemblages. This was the first report of Giardia infection in pet prairie dogs in Bangkok, Thailand. The results revealed that these pet prairie dogs in Thailand were infected with zoonotic assemblages of G. duodenalis sub-genotype AI, which might have been derived from animal contaminants, whereas sub-genotype BIV might have been derived from human contaminants. Owners of prairie dogs might be at risk of giardiasis or be the source of infection to their exotic pets.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e8059a22eec1bd594056875f2cd21033a5d6eb6b,e8059a22eec1bd594056875f2cd21033a5d6eb6b,"[{'authorId': '4001767', 'name': 'Ketsarin Kamyingkird'}, {'authorId': '88950369', 'name': 'Pornkamol Phoosangwalthong'}, {'authorId': '2167819583', 'name': 'Nutsuda Klinkaew'}, {'authorId': '1920658409', 'name': 'Alisara Leelanupat'}, {'authorId': '5112551', 'name': 'C.

The Marmaduke Problem,"Michigan State University (MSU) is home to one of the largest library comics collections in North America, holding over three hundred thousand print comic book titles and artifacts. Inspired by the interdisciplinary opportunity offered by digital humanities practice, a research collaborative linked to the MSU Library Digital Scholarship Lab (DSL) developed a Collections as Data project focused on the Comic Art Collection. This team extracted and cleaned over forty-five thousand MARC records describing comics published in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The dataset is openly available through a GitLab repository, where the team has shared data visualizations so that scholars and members of the public can explore and interrogate this unique collection. In order to bridge digital humanities with the popular culture legacy ofthe institution, the MSU comics community turned to bibliographic metadata as a new way to leverage the collection for scholarly analysis. In October 2020, the Department of English Graphic Possibilities Research Workshop gathered a group of scholars, librarians, Wikidatians, and enthusiasts for a virtual Wikidata edit-a-thon. This project report will present this event as a case study to discuss how linked open metadata may be used to create knowledge and how community knowledge can, in turn, enrich metadata. We explore not only how our participants utilized the open-access tool Mix’n’match to connect the Comic Art Collection dataset to Wikidata and increase awareness of lesser-known authors and regional publishers missing from OCLC and Library of Congress databases, but how the knowledge of this community in turn revealed issues of authority control.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/55466f9324f8edb13f923c6617290eab60ab99a6,55466f9324f8edb13f923c6617290eab60ab99a6,"[{'authorId': '2166559796', 'name': 'Kate Topham'}, {'authorId': '31893418', 'name': 'J.

Are stress-related pathways of social status differentiation more important determinants of health inequities in countries with higher levels of income inequality?,"We explored socioeconomic gradients in self-rated overall health (SROH) using indicators of materialist (educational attainment and perceived income adequacy) and psychosocial perspectives (subjective social status (SSS)) among adults living in countries with varying levels of income inequality, and the importance of psychosocial stress in mediating these associations. If psychosocial processes at the individual and societal levels correspond, associations between SSS and SROH should be higher among adults in countries with higher income inequality, and psychosocial stress should be a more important mediator of these associations. We used multigroup structural equation models to analyse cross-sectional data from the International Food Policy Study of adults (n = 22,824) in Australia, Canada, Mexico, the UK and the United States. Associations between SSS and SROH were not higher in more unequal countries, nor was psychosocial stress a more important mediator of these associations.

Women in Prisons,"Before being locked up, incarcerated women are more marginalized, have higher rates of mental illness and substance misuse, and have more often experienced physical or sexual victimization than incarcerated men. Women experience prison differently. However, much of what we know about women’s experiences comes from research in the United States and the United Kingdom, providing little insight into women prisoners’ experiences elsewhere. This is unfortunate for many reasons; policy makers wishing to develop evidence-based initiatives, for example, cannot know whether what seems to work in one place is appropriate in another. Case studies from Canada, Norway, and Mexico reveal similarities and substantial differences in women’s experiences. Incarcerated women in all three places have histories of victimization and identify their children as their primary motivator to desist from crime and drug use. However, how they relate to programming, prison work, accommodation, and prison food varies greatly. How women in these three different countries experience imprisonment is related to conditions of their lives outside of prison and to the nature, extent, and quality of available social welfare services. Researchers need to pay much closer attention to geographical and contextual differences when assessing the conditions, challenges, and prospects of women in prisons.",2022,8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6a0dbc18fc376c8a664df67990d513a6c9a97347,6a0dbc18fc376c8a664df67990d513a6c9a97347,"[{'authorId': '81066894', 'name': 'Sandra M.

Disgust sensitivity and support for immigration across five nations,"Abstract. Immigration has become a focal debate in politics across the world. Recent research suggests that anti-immigration attitudes may have deep psychological roots in implicit disease avoidance motivations. A key implication of this theory is that individual differences in disease avoidance should be related to opposition to immigration across a wide variety of cultural and political contexts. However, existing evidence on the topic has come almost entirely from the United States and Canada. In this article, we test the disease avoidance hypothesis using nationally representative samples from Norway, Sweden, Turkey, and Mexico, as well as two diverse samples from the United States. We find consistent and robust evidence that disgust sensitivity is associated with anti-immigration attitudes and that the relationship is similar in magnitude to education. Overall, our findings support the disease avoidance hypothesis and provide new insights into the nature of anti-immigration attitudes.",2022,8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6b6f5424afe683759047c5be01b2b4f0ba36e03c,6b6f5424afe683759047c5be01b2b4f0ba36e03c,"[{'authorId': '47467129', 'name': 'Scott Clifford'}, {'authorId': '100798393', 'name': 'Cengiz Erişen'}, {'authorId': '117437102', 'name': 'Dane G.

A Process‐Model Perspective on Recent Changes in the Carbon Cycle of North America,"Continental North America has been found to be a carbon (C) sink over recent decades by multiple studies employing a variety of estimation approaches. However, several key questions and uncertainties remain with these assessments. Here we used results from an ensemble of 19 state‐of‐the‐art dynamic global vegetation models from the TRENDYv9 project to improve these estimates and study the drivers of its interannual variability. Our results show that North America has been a C sink with a magnitude of 0.37 ± 0.38 (mean and one standard deviation) PgC year−1 for the period 2000–2019 (0.31 and 0.44 PgC year−1 in each decade); split into 0.18 ± 0.12 PgC year−1 in Canada (0.15 and 0.20), 0.16 ± 0.17 in the United States (0.14 and 0.17), 0.02 ± 0.05 PgC year−1 in Mexico (0.02 and 0.02) and 0.01 ± 0.02 in Central America and the Caribbean (0.01 and 0.01). About 57% of the new C assimilated by terrestrial ecosystems is allocated into vegetation, 30% into soils, and 13% into litter. Losses of C due to fire account for 41% of the interannual variability of the mean net biome productivity for all North America in the model ensemble. Finally, we show that drought years (e.g., 2002) have the potential to shift the region to a small net C source in the simulations (−0.02 ± 0.46 PgC year−1). Our results highlight the importance of identifying the major drivers of the interannual variability of the continental‐scale land C cycle along with the spatial distribution of local sink‐source dynamics.",2022,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26641db27083426c8249af6f1e6c00337cc6a419,26641db27083426c8249af6f1e6c00337cc6a419,"[{'authorId': '1397193301', 'name': 'Guillermo N.

Multi-isotopes in human hair: A tool to initiate cross-border collaboration in international cold-cases,"Unidentified human remains have historically been investigated nationally by law enforcement authorities. However, this approach is outdated in a globalized world with rapid transportation means, where humans easily move long distances across borders. Cross-border cooperation in solving cold-cases is rare due to political, administrative or technical challenges. It is fundamental to develop new tools to provide rapid and cost-effective leads for international cooperation. In this work, we demonstrate that isotopic measurements are effective screening tools to help identify cold-cases with potential international ramifications. We first complete existing databases of hydrogen and sulfur isotopes in human hair from residents across North America by compiling or analyzing hair from Canada, the United States (US) and Mexico. Using these databases, we develop maps predicting isotope variations in human hair across North America. We demonstrate that both δ2H and δ34S values of human hair are highly predictable and display strong spatial patterns. Multi-isotope analysis combined with dual δ2H and δ34S geographic probability maps provide evidence for international travel in two case studies. In the first, we demonstrate that multi-isotope analysis in bulk hair of deceased border crossers found in the US, close to the Mexico-US border, help trace their last place of residence or travel back to specific regions of Mexico. These findings were validated by the subsequent identification of these individuals through the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner in Tucson, Arizona. In the second case study, we demonstrate that sequential multi-isotope analysis along the hair strands of an unidentified individual found in Canada provides detailed insights into the international mobility of this individual during the last year of life. In both cases, isotope data provide strong leads towards international travel.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1765764b0ef0f9ffa4a111f8453f5b68db4e033e,1765764b0ef0f9ffa4a111f8453f5b68db4e033e,"[{'authorId': '9770031', 'name': 'C.

Strategies to mitigate shifts in red oak (Quercus sect. Lobatae) distribution under a changing climate.,"Red oaks (Quercus sect. Lobatae) are a taxonomic group of hardwood trees which occur in swamp forests, subtropical chaparral, and savannahs from Columbia to Canada. They cover a wide range of ecological niches, and many species are thought to be able to cope with current trends in climate change. Genus Quercus encompasses ca. 500 species, of which ca. 80 make up sect. Lobatae. Species diversity is greatest within the southeastern United States and within the northern and eastern regions of Mexico. This review discusses the weak reproductive barriers between species of red oaks and the effects this has on speciation and niche range. Distribution and diversity have been shaped by drought adaptations common to the species of sect. Lobatae, which enable them to fill various xeric niches across the continent. Drought adaptive traits of this taxonomic group include deciduousness, deep tap roots, ring-porous xylem, regenerative stump sprouting, greater leaf thickness, and smaller stomata. The complex interplay between these anatomical and morphological traits have given red oaks features of drought tolerance and avoidance. Here, we discuss physiological and genetic components of these adaptations to address how many species of sect. Lobatae reside within xeric sites and/or sustain normal metabolic function during drought. Although extensive drought adaptation appears to give sect. Lobatae a resilience to climate change, aging tree stands, oak life history traits, and the current genetic structures places many red oak species at risk. Furthermore, oak decline, a complex interaction between abiotic and biotic agents, has severe effects on red oaks, and is likely to accelerate species decline and fragmentation. We suggest that assisted migration can be used to avoid species fragmentation and increase climate change resilience of sect. Lobatae.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c7e3bc261aec3e84fc2ce0491f2fc99ada37d99,6c7e3bc261aec3e84fc2ce0491f2fc99ada37d99,"[{'authorId': '15144452', 'name': 'J.

Whole Genome Resources and Species-level Taxonomic Validation of 89 Plant Pathogenic Xanthomonas Strains Isolated from Various Host Plants.,"Bacterial spot disease (BSD) caused by Xanthomonas species is a global threat to tomato and pepper plants. A recent classification of these pathogens indicated the need for a diverse dataset of whole-genome resources. We report whole-genome resources of 89 Xanthomonas strains isolated from Canada (44), United States (30), Argentina (4), Brazil (3), Costa Rica (2), New Zealand (1), Australia (1), Mexico (1), Taiwan (1), Thailand (1) and unknown (1). Of these strains, 48 were previously identified to species-level based on non-genome-based approaches while 41 strains were classified only at the genus-level. The average coverage of the sequencing reads was 103x. The draft genome sizes ranged from 4.53-5.46 Mbp with a G+C content of 63.53 - 67.78% and comprised of 4,233-5,178 protein-coding sequences. Using average nucleotide identity (ANI) and genome-based DNA-DNA Hybridization (gDDH) values, the taxonomic classifications were validated for 38 out of the 48 strains previously assigned to species-level using other methods. Ten strains previously identified as X. campestris, X. axonopodis, X. vasicola and X. arboricola were incorrectly assigned, and new species-level delineations are proposed. Data from ANI, gDDH and pan-genome phylogeny of shared protein families were used to assign the 41 strains, previously identified only to genus-level, into 5 distinct species, X. euvesicatoria (pv. euvesicatoria or pv. perforans), X. hortorum pv. gardneri, X. vesicatoria, X. campestris and X. arboricola. These 89 whole-genome sequences of Xanthomonas strains, the majority (49.4%) of which are from Canada, could be useful resources in our understanding of global population structure and evolution of these pathogens.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f11d801da72cad6ce16e51e9be207dc8531ccec,6f11d801da72cad6ce16e51e9be207dc8531ccec,"[{'authorId': '5749676', 'name': 'J.

Meat-reduced Dietary Practices and Efforts in Five Countries: Analysis of Cross-sectional Surveys in 2018 and 2019.,"BACKGROUND
Diets that reduce reliance on animal-source foods are recommended in some contexts.


OBJECTIVES
This study aimed to compare proportions of respondents who reported following meat-reduced dietary practices (i.e., vegetarian, vegan or pescatarian diets) and/or making efforts to reduce animal-source foods, and to examine sociodemographic correlates across five countries.


METHODS
Online surveys were conducted in November/December 2018 and 2019 with 41,607 adults from Australia (n = 7926), Canada (n = 8031), Mexico (n = 8110), the United Kingdom (UK; n = 9129) and the United States (US; n = 8411) as part of the International Food Policy Study. Respondents were asked if they would describe themselves as vegetarian, vegan or pescatarian, and if they had made efforts to consume less red meat, all meats, and dairy products in the past year. Logistic regressions examined differences in the likelihood of each behaviour between countries and sociodemographic subgroups.


RESULTS
Approximately 1 in 10 respondents reported following a vegetarian, vegan or pescatarian diet, ranging from 8.6% (Canada) to 11.7% (UK). In the past 12 months, the proportions of respondents who reported efforts to consume less red meat ranged from 34.5% (Australia) to 44.4% (Mexico); efforts to consume less of all meats ranged from 27.9% (US) to 35.2% (Mexico), and efforts to consume less dairy were reported by 20.6% (UK) to 41.3% (Mexico). Respondents were more likely to report efforts to consume less animal-source products in 2019 compared to 2018 in most countries. Sociodemographic patterns varied by country; in general, women, those with higher education, and those in minority ethnic groups were more likely to report following meat-reduced dietary practices or efforts to consume fewer animal-source products.


CONCLUSIONS
Nearly half of respondents reported following a meat-reduced diet or efforts to reduce animal-source products, with differences between countries and population subgroups. Population-level approaches and policies that support meat-reduction may further reduce consumption of animal-source products.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a03f814dff933a39f450aaf33591ed9d0592e2e,1a03f814dff933a39f450aaf33591ed9d0592e2e,"[{'authorId': '4808531', 'name': 'L.

Movement and Indigenous Religions: A Reconsideration of Mobile Ways of Knowing and Being,"Abstract This special issue brings together leading scholars in the field of Indigenous religions working with Indigenous Peoples from the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Europe on the topics of movement, mobility, pilgrimage, and walking as they intersect with issues of religion and spirituality. Anthropologists and scholars of religion working with various Indigenous Peoples have tended to theorize Indigeneity as denoting a cultural and historic connection to a particular land-base, yet they have not always attended to the full complexity of Indigenous Peoples’ mobile lived realities. We contend that a critical re-examination and revaluing of Indigenous mobile ways of knowing and being serves as one of several steps needed to decolonize the study of religion. Throughout this issue contributors examine various Indigenous discourses, practices, and politics of movement in order to highlight the historic and ongoing importance of mobility for cultivating personhood, maintaining networks of affinity and belonging, fostering political alliances and solidarities, and generating religious meaning.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c2a666f12ed496d2822a0f9a7ad64455f7096baa,c2a666f12ed496d2822a0f9a7ad64455f7096baa,"[{'authorId': '105070387', 'name': 'M.

Impact of Climate Change on Individual and Community Mental Health,"This paper provides an overview of the current and prospective climate change-related risks and impacts on individual and community mental health, as outlined by studies from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico, and Pakistan, in addition to a few European countries from 2000 to January 2022. It argues three major points, first, certain vulnerabilities exist with regards to which populations are most atrisk of experiencing poor psychological well-being. The main vulnerabilities and risk factors highlighted in the paper are low socioeconomic background, young age, and communities having close cultural and working relationships with the environment. Second, climate change-induced natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, wildfires, and heatwaves can have several impacts on mental health, mainly due to worsening physical health, disruption of community cohesion, and forced relocation. The concept of community resilience is also discussed. Finally, the relationship between heat waves and increased psychological fatigue and feelings of hostility is also explored, linked with rising crime rate which can further impact individual and community mental health. It was concluded that climate change impacts individual and community mental health in many ways and that certain gaps in knowledge, such as the factors influencing the severity of this impact and the reasons behind the existence of vulnerabilities among populations, need to be addressed and incorporated into future action. Moreover, adaptive action needs to be taken in preparing societies for the impact of climate change. This includes increasing accessibility to quality mental healthcare and creating protective legal frameworks for those who are disproportionately affected by interpersonal violence during and after climate-related natural disasters.

"Open Science, Open Data, and New Opportunities for Cooperative Extension","The array of problems presented to Extension professionals is broad and growing in number and complexity. As Extension has demonstrated its adaptability in addressing these issues, new ways of working have emerged. Access to an expanding pool of scientific reports and data can potentially provide Extension professionals with the greater tools and knowledge they need to collaboratively engage with their communities. However, a key challenge and possible impediment will be access to rapidly emerging research and data. Open science and open data can broaden the evidence base available to Extension educators, and the emerging field of data science offers new tools to help Extension stakeholders make data-informed decisions. A new data-sharing partnership among Canada, Mexico, and the United States may serve as a model for other countries’ rural advisory services and national Extension systems. Fully implementing this expanded role for Extension will require resources to establish a National Community Learning Network and a national data commons as well as advocacy for open access policies at all levels of government. As abstract as open science and open data may seem to local and regional Extension practitioners, equal access to scientific knowledge and underlying research data is not only imperative for local community engagement but also integral for locally appropriate decision-making. Widening access to research and data directly supports the democratization of science and Extension. Opening scientific research and providing effective access to publicly financed data will become essential platforms for university engagement and Extension. It is critical for Extension professionals to understand the analytic powers and emerging policies that easily-accessed research and data can bring to collaborative community engagement.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/455ced1ca649080da7b00db6cc6754f8036e9a9e,455ced1ca649080da7b00db6cc6754f8036e9a9e,"[{'authorId': '4625524', 'name': 'C.

The Link between Economic Growth and Sustainable Energy in G7-Countries and E7-Countries: Evidence from a Dynamic Panel Threshold Model,"The available literature on sustainable energy use and economic growth nexus yields conflicting conclusions, as the effect can be positive, negative, or insignificant. This research explores the causal link between sustainable energy use and economic growth in G7-countries (Japan, Canada, Germany, Italy, France, United Kingdom, and United States) and E7-countries (Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, China, Mexico, India, and Turkey) countries from 1990 to 2019. We discover that sustainable energy use and economic growth are proportional. Our results show that sustainable energy use positively affects economic growth if E7-countries exceed a specific threshold. It is detrimental to economic growth for the E7 countries' sustainable energy use to fall below a certain threshold. The use of sustainable energy has no significant impact on economic growth, although it does have a positive and noticeable impact in the G7 countries. In order for the countries of the G7 to see positive economic growth as a result of their investment in renewable energy, it is necessary for those nations to surpass a certain threshold in terms of their use of sustainable energy.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32bc2a5df17920726e8c85311fb654878de3c61e,32bc2a5df17920726e8c85311fb654878de3c61e,"[{'authorId': '72154922', 'name': 'N.

International Reactions to the Capitol Attack of January 6th: A Media Frames Analysis,"On January 6, 2021, the United States experienced an insurrection at the United States Capitol that was framed in varying and complex ways by traditional U.S. allies, competing nations, and adversaries. This manuscript examines the statements of foreign leaders, international media reports, and social media posts through a media framing analysis. Thousands of pages of press reports from countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada, Australia, Mexico, Israel, Russia, and China, formed different views of the insurrection. There were concerns about U.S. democracy, questions about U.S. leadership, and expressions of each nation’s self-interest in the transactional nature of their own economical, ideological or political interests.

And Still She Rises: Policies for Improving Women’s Health for a More Equitable Post-Pandemic World,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spawned crises of violence, hunger and impoverishment. Maternal and Infant Health Canada (MIHCan) conducted this policy action study to explore how changes that have arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic may catalyze potential improvements in global women’s health toward the creation of a more equitable post-pandemic world. In this mixed methods study, 280 experts in women’s health responded to our survey and 65 subsequently participated in focus groups, including professionals from India, Egypt/Sudan, Canada and the United States/Mexico. From the results of this study, our recommendations include augmenting mental health through more open dialogue, valuing and compensating those working on the frontlines through living wages, paid sick leave and enhanced benefits and expanding digital technology that facilitates flexible work locations, thereby freeing time for improving the wellbeing of caregivers and families and offering telemedicine and telecounseling, which delivers greater access to care. We also recommend bridging the digital divide through the widespread provision of reliable and affordable internet services and digital literacy training. These policy recommendations for employers, governments and health authorities aim to improve mental and physical wellbeing and working conditions, while leveraging the potential of digital technology for healthcare provision for those who identify as women, knowing that others will benefit. MIHCan took action on the recommendation to improve mental health through open conversation by facilitating campaigns in all study regions.

Winter Storm Uri: Resource Loss and Psychosocial Outcomes of Critical Infrastructure Failure in Texas,"In February of 2021, Winter Storm Uri affected parts of the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Texas was particularly hard hit, as the state’s primary power provider, ERCOT (the Electric Reliability Council of Texas), proved to be unprepared for the event—de-spite similar storms in 1989 and 2011 that revealed weaknesses in the state’s electric grid system. This article investigates psychosocial outcomes of individuals who experienced Winter Storm Uri. Drawing upon survey data collected in Texas in April and May of 2022, we illustrate ways in which loss of critical infrastructure and compounding results influence levels of stress among respondents. Using Hofoll’s (1989, 1991) Conservation of Resources model of stress, we find that Uri-related losses of objects and conditions resources contribute to elevated stress as measured by the Avoidance subscale of the Impact of Event Scale (Horowitz 1976; Horowitz, Wilner, and Alvarez 1979)— more than one year after the disaster. Our regression model consisting of indicators of objects resource loss, conditions resource loss, and demographic characteristics ex-plains approximately 33 percent of the variance in the Avoidance subscale. Findings suggest that more attention should be paid to the social impacts of critical infrastructure failures and that such impacts should be addressed by improving critical infrastructure policy and regulations, as well as the physical structures.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eca901b4846a03e4fbe195f15967be44be08ae4b,eca901b4846a03e4fbe195f15967be44be08ae4b,"[{'authorId': '47429662', 'name': 'L.

Rapid Damage Estimation of Texas Winter Storm Uri from Social Media Using Deep Neural Networks,"The winter storm Uri that occurred in February 2021 affected many regions in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The State of Texas was severely impacted due to the failure in the electricity supply infrastructure compounded by its limited connectivity to other grid systems in the United States. The georeferenced estimation of the storm’s impact is crucial for response and recovery. However, such information was not available until several months afterward, mainly due to the time-consuming and costly assessment processes. The latency to provide timely information particularly impacted people in the economically disadvantaged communities, who lack resources to ameliorate the impact of the storm. This work explores the potential for disaster impact estimation based on the analysis of instant social media content, which can provide actionable information to assist first responders, volunteers, governments, and the general public. In our prototype, a deep neural network (DNN) uses geolocated social media content (texts, images, and videos) to provide monetary assessments of the damage at zip code level caused by Uri, achieving up to 70% accuracy. In addition, the performance analysis across geographical regions shows that the fully trained model is able to estimate the damage for economically disadvantaged regions, such as West Texas. Our methods have the potential to promote social equity by guiding the deployment or recovery resources to the regions where it is needed based on damage assessment.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4ecf7a46a011de68653cb60f4eec2a95335ae4bb,4ecf7a46a011de68653cb60f4eec2a95335ae4bb,"[{'authorId': '1475753804', 'name': 'Yalong Pi'}, {'authorId': '50184120', 'name': 'X.

Correlates of Self-reported and Functional Understanding of Nutrition Labels across Five Countries in the 2018 International Food Policy Study.,"BACKGROUND
Nutrition labels on pre-packaged foods are an important source of nutrition information; however, differences in comprehension of varying label formats may limit their use and effectiveness.


OBJECTIVES
This study examined levels and correlates of consumers' self-reported understanding of Nutrition Facts tables (NFt) and Front-of-Package (FOP) labels, as well as functional NFt understanding.


METHODS
Adults (≥18 years) in Australia (n = 3901), Canada (n = 4107), Mexico (n = 4012), United Kingdom (UK) (n = 5121), and the United States (US) (n = 4445) completed online surveys in November-December 2018. Descriptive statistics summarized sample profiles by country. Linear regression models examined the association between label understanding (self-reported NFt and FOP, functional NFt) and consumer dietary behaviours, functional nutrition knowledge, and sociodemographic characteristics. NFt understanding was measured in all countries, with FOP labelling assessed only in Mexico, Australia, and the UK.


RESULTS
Self-reported and functional NFt understanding was significantly higher in the US and Canada (P < 0.0001). In adjusted analyses, functional NFt understanding was significantly higher among women than men (P < 0.0001); respondents from the 'majority' ethnic group in their respective countries compared to minority ethnic groups (P < 0.0001); those with higher education levels (P < 0.0001) and functional nutrition knowledge compared to their lower education and nutrition knowledge counterparts (P < 0.0001), respectively; and those making efforts to consume less sodium, sugar or fat compared to those not reporting dietary efforts (P < 0.0001). Self-reported FOP label understanding was significantly higher for interpretive labelling systems in Australia (Health Star Ratings) and the UK (Traffic Lights) compared with Mexico's Guideline Daily Amounts (GDA) (P < 0.0001).


CONCLUSIONS
Nutrition labels requiring greater numeracy skills (i.e., NFt, GDA) were more difficult for consumers to understand than interpretive FOP labels (i.e., Traffic Lights). Differences in NFt and FOP label understanding by income adequacy and education suggest potential disparities in labelling policy effects among vulnerable subgroups.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dccb256d79294c77de81d5c10cb9ba9ce19f6a3b,dccb256d79294c77de81d5c10cb9ba9ce19f6a3b,"[{'authorId': '4041916', 'name': 'Jasmin Bhawra'}, {'authorId': '3672758', 'name': 'S.

Bridging Capital in Community Conservation: A Case Study of the Taos Community Conservation Plan,"Abstract If the United States land trust movement can overcome decades of institutionalized discrimination, it must institute sustained bridging capital to neglected constituents. This qualitative case study employs community-based conservation research literature findings to examine the bridging efficacy of an equity-based conservation plan in Taos, New Mexico. Interviews were combined with related documents and researcher observation in qualitative analysis. Results indicate conventional planning tools were inadequate in bridging Taos’s Hispanic community, although experiential opportunities at an associated park project showed greater promise. Findings support research indicating community bridging efforts should move away from instrumental efforts focused on specific outcomes toward ones that address agency issues in long-term, intrinsic trust-building processes. However, equity-based initiatives such as the TCCP can initiate other bridging capital benefits such as enhancing trust and consensus between groups and overcoming previous conflicts.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a0a94bbf90313685d043b37146e4da28e0f7cfc0,a0a94bbf90313685d043b37146e4da28e0f7cfc0,"[{'authorId': '33450459', 'name': 'A.

Identifying Core Competencies for Remote Delivery of Psychological Interventions: A Rapid Review.,"OBJECTIVE
The COVID-19 pandemic led to a rapid shift toward remote delivery of psychological interventions and transition to voice-only and video communication platforms. However, agreement is lacking on key competencies that are aligned with equitable approaches for standardized training and supervision of remote psychological intervention delivery. A rapid review was conducted to identify and describe competencies that could inform best practices of remote services delivery during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.


METHODS
Scopus, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO were searched for literature published in English (2015-2021) on competencies for synchronous, remote psychological interventions that can be measured through observation.


RESULTS
Of 135 articles identified, 12 met inclusion criteria. Studies targeted populations in high-income countries (11 in the United States and Canada, one in Saudi Arabia) and focused on specialist practitioners, professionals, or trainees in professional or prelicensure programs working with adult populations. Ten skill categories were identified: emergency and safety protocols for remote services, facilitating communication over remote platforms, remote consent procedures, technological literacy, practitioner-client identification for remote services, confidentiality during remote services, communication skills during remote services, engagement and interpersonal skills for remote services, establishing professional boundaries during remote services, and encouraging continuity of care during remote services.


CONCLUSIONS
These 10 skills domains can offer a foundation for refinement of discrete, individual-level competencies that can be aligned with global initiatives promoting use of observational competency assessment during training and supervision programs for psychological interventions. More research is needed on identification of and agreement on remote competencies and on their evaluation.",2022,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/71daee9c0ac43e95e8b8f9d95c16373b6b8da919,71daee9c0ac43e95e8b8f9d95c16373b6b8da919,"[{'authorId': '50812643', 'name': 'G.

Gender and Regionalization in North America: From NAFTA to CUSMA and Beyond?,"The literature on world regions is largely gender-blind. This article suggests ways in which the study of regionalism can incorporate gender analysis, based on the case of North America. It argues that this can be done in three ways: through an examination of the gendered impact of regional integration; through an examination of how gender concerns are, or can be, mainstreamed into regional policies; and through research on new forms of feminist-inspired activism that may shape regional outcomes. After applying these perspectives to the case of North America and the new Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement, it argues that despite the failure of the Canadian government to achieve the inclusion of a gender chapter, the inclusion of language around gender discrimination in the labour chapter makes the new agreement a more effective (if still limited) tool for promotion of some forms of gender equality.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b954bfcd923dd1b318a2495cb00550d4a5e0cc7a,b954bfcd923dd1b318a2495cb00550d4a5e0cc7a,"[{'authorId': '2060063085', 'name': 'Laura Macdonald'}]"
"Nucleotide and structural polymorphisms of the eastern oyster genome paint a mosaic of divergence, selection, and human impacts","The eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, is a valuable fishery and aquaculture species that provides critical services as an ecosystem engineer. Oysters have a life-history that promotes high genetic diversity and gene flow while also occupying a wide range of habitats in variable coastal environments from the southern Gulf of Mexico to the southern waters of Atlantic Canada. To understand the interplay of genetic diversity, gene flow, and intense environmental selection, we used whole genome re-sequencing data from 90 individuals across the eastern United States and Gulf of Mexico, plus 5 selectively bred lines. Our data confirmed a large phylogeographic break between oyster populations in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast of the USA. We also demonstrated that domestication has artificially admixed genetic material between the two ocean basins, and selected lines with admixed ancestry continue to maintain heterozygosity at these sites through several generations post admixture, possibly indicating relevance to desirable aquaculture traits. We found that genetic and structural variation are high in both wild and selected populations, but we also demonstrated that, when controlling for domestication admixture across ocean basins, wild populations do have significantly higher levels of nucleotide diversity and copy number variation than selected lines. Within the Atlantic coast, we detected subtle but distinct population structure, introgression of selected lines within wild individuals, an interaction between structural variation and putatively adaptive population structure, and evidence of candidate genes responding to selection from salinity. Our study highlights the potential for applying whole genome sequencing to highly polymorphic species and provides a road map for future work examining the genome variation of eastern oyster populations.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/084d36a513db4ce43f5e25668d1937f594c9d9f9,084d36a513db4ce43f5e25668d1937f594c9d9f9,"[{'authorId': '2304044', 'name': 'Jonathan B.

Coordination and monetary policy among central banks. The NAFTA Case,"In this document we demonstrated how the central banks that constitute the NAFTA (Canada, the United States of America and Mexico), coordinate around the leader country with the aim to maintain the stability and proper functioning of financial markets. For that, we estimated a VAR model to show the interdependence among interest rates related to monetary policy. According to the obtained results, we found evidence that interest rates from Canada and Mexico are determined to a greater extent by the US Federal monetary policy decisions and to a lesser degree by internal conditions of each economy. We confirmed that the interdependence among the NAFTA countries occurs through the leading economy.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae8f6177d8ade75ef42f6e01b15689ad087fe755,ae8f6177d8ade75ef42f6e01b15689ad087fe755,"[{'authorId': '2222968720', 'name': 'Javier Galan Figueroa'}, {'authorId': '2220371548', 'name': 'Fátima Irina Villalba Padilla'}]"
Latitudinal gradient of fire return interval in conifer forests of western North America,"ABSTRACT Mean fire interval (MFI) is the average time between successive fires, influenced by environmental factors such as latitude, elevation, and vegetation type. This study evaluated the relationship between MFI and latitude in conifer forests of western North America. First, we obtained pre-fire-disruption MFI data from dendrochronology-based fire history studies in western Canada, the United States, and Mexico montane ranges. Then, we used generalized additive models (GAMs) to evaluate the relationship between MFI and latitude, considering elevation and conifer forest type as covariables. In addition, we mapped the spatial mean fire intervals (SMFIs) through inverse distance weighting (IDW). MFI increased significantly at higher latitudes, influenced by elevation and conifer forest type (R2 = 0.7). Furthermore, we found longer MFI in high elevations of the Madrean Archipelago, the Rocky Mountains, and the Alaska Range. Fire frequency also decreased in the boreal, Douglas-fir, and subalpine forests, with MFI longer than 20 yr. Moreover, the shortest SMFIs were found in the Mexican sierras and the Madrean Archipelago, with fire intervals between 4.1 and 5.6 yr. Our results showed a latitudinal gradient of MFI in conifer forests of western North America, which provides valuable information for fire management and the restoration of natural fire regimes.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/942c0f4ac5aed0a727b10ac5082199862969ffb0,942c0f4ac5aed0a727b10ac5082199862969ffb0,"[{'authorId': '1420136252', 'name': 'J.

"Building bridges and breaking down silos: A framework for developing interdisciplinary, international academic-community research collaborations for the benefit of sexual and gender minority youth","ABSTRACT Interdisciplinary collaboration fuels research innovation and funders are increasingly offering long-term grants prioritising partnerships. However, a gap remains regarding the effective development, evaluatation, and sustainment of research partnerships; particularly those supporting marginalised populations like sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY). There is a concomitant need to expand research internationally to cross-culturally conceptualise SGMY’s experiences, which information and communication technologies (ICTs) may facilitate. The International Partnership for Queer Youth Resilience (INQYR) is a research consortium comprising over 40 academic and community representatives investigating and addressing issues faced by SGMY in Canada, the United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), and Mexico from an interdisciplinary perspective by: (a) conducting and disseminating interventions and exploratory research on SGMY’s ICT use, and (b) training cohorts of SGMY scholars and practitioners. This article details INQYR’s rationale and formation, including its objectives and organisational framework. Facilitators and barriers are discussed through reflection on INQYR’s first operational phase from 2018–2021, considering collaboration with diverse stakeholders and settings; shared goals; language and technology barriers; personal and workload barriers; infrastructure; and power and historical tensions. Implications for other research partnerships and concrete tools such as author guidelines for large-scale research partnership formation, operation, and evaluation are discussed.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cb9edc406b95615c2e22f0bde9b8e315e327611c,cb9edc406b95615c2e22f0bde9b8e315e327611c,"[{'authorId': '36306370', 'name': 'Shelley L.

"Issue-Areas, Sovereignty Costs, and North Americans’ Attitudes Toward Regional Cooperation","Studies of public opinion toward regionalism tend to rely on questions regarding trade integration and speciﬁc regional organizations. This narrow focus overlooks dimensions of regionalism that sit at the heart of international relations research on regions today. Instead, we argue that research should explore public preferences with respect to regional cooperation in different issue-areas. We ﬁnd that people’s views of regional cooperation in North America diverge from their attitudes toward trade integration alone. Using data from Rethinking North America, an untapped public opinion survey conducted in Mexico, Canada, and the United States in 2013, we show that although country-level attitudes toward trade integration in North America were similar, preferences for regional cooperation varied by country depending on the issue at hand. We propose that attitudes are shaped by citizens’ perceptions of the asymmetric patterns of national-level beneﬁts and vulnerabilities created by regional cooperation. Generally, respondents favor cooperation where their state stands to gain greater capacity beneﬁts and oppose it where cooperation imposes greater costs on national autonomy. For policymakers, this multifaceted approach to regionalism sheds light on areas where public preferences for regional cooperation might converge. Future research that disaggregates various aspects of support for regional cooperation should help integrate the study of public opinion with “new” and comparative regional approaches that emphasize the aspects of regionalism beyond trade and formal institutions. Les études de l’opinion publique envers le régionalisme tendent à reposer sur des questions relatives à l’intégration com- merciale et à des organisations régionales spéciﬁques.

1394. Clinical and Sociodemographic Characteristics Associated with Poor Self-rated Health across Multiple Domains among Older North American Adults Living with HIV,"
 
 
 Older adults living with HIV (OALHIV) are a growing demographic in North America. We summarized baseline characteristics and associated self-rated suboptimal health in North American OALHIV.
 
 
 
 OALHIV aged ≥ 50 years from the United States, Canada, and Mexico who participated in the 25-country 2019 Positive Perspectives survey were included. Self-rated health was assessed across 4 domains (physical, mental, sexual, overall); each was dichotomized as optimal (Good/Very good) or suboptimal (Neither good nor poor/Poor/Very poor). Multinomial logistic regression was measured for associations between domains and relevant sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.
 
 
 
 Of 583 participants from North America, 161 were aged ≥ 50 years and included in this analysis. Most were male (73%), 14% were aged ≥ 65 years, 66% were diagnosed with HIV ≥ 10 years ago, median disease duration was 20 years, and 55% took ≥ 5 non-HIV pills daily. Most OALHIV (n=128; 80%) had switched antiretroviral therapy (ART) at least once, 14% (18/128) because of potential drug-drug interactions and 22% (28/128) because it was no longer effective or for resistance, and 6% were very treatment experienced (changed ART ≥ 4 times, with ≥ 1 switch in the past year for resistance or poor tolerability). Among OALHIV, 86% reported ≥ 1 comorbidity; the most common were hypertension (42%), hypercholesterolemia (39%), mental illness (32%), and insomnia (29%). Overall, 48% (77/161) of OALHIV reported suboptimal physical health, 35% (56/161) suboptimal mental health, 60% (97/161) suboptimal sexual health, and 47% (75/161) suboptimal overall health. On all domains, 19% (31/161) reported suboptimal health; 24% (38/161) reported optimal health on all domains, 23% (37/161) on 3 domains only, 13% (21/161) on 2 domains only, and 21% (34/161) on 1 domain only. Comorbidities with a > 15% difference between OALHIV reporting suboptimal health in all domains vs those reporting optimal health in at least 1 domain, respectively, were mental health (48% vs 28%), substance abuse (26% vs 5%, as self-reported in the survey), bone disease (26% vs 8%), and insomnia (42% vs 25%).
 
 
 
 Most OALHIV in North America reported comorbidities and polypharmacy, with approximately one-quarter reporting suboptimal health on all domains.

Understanding Historical Trauma Among Urban Indigenous Adults at Risk for Diabetes.,"Historical trauma has been posited as a key framework for conceptualizing and addressing health equity in Indigenous populations. Using a community-based participatory approach, this study aimed to examine historical trauma and key psycho-social correlates among urban Indigenous adults at risk for diabetes to inform diabetes and other chronic disease prevention strategies. Indigenous adult participants (n=207) were recruited from an urban area in California and were asked to identify whether their Indigenous heritage was from a group in the United States, Canada, or Latin America. Historical trauma was assessed using the Historical Loss (HLS) and Historical Loss Associated Symptoms (HLAS) scales. Nearly half (49%) of Indigenous participants from the United States or Canada endorsed thinking about one or more historical losses weekly, daily, or several times a day, compared to 32% for Indigenous participants from Mexico, Central America, and South America. Most participants (62%) reported experiencing one or more historical loss-associated symptoms, such as depression and anger, sometimes, often, or always. Ancestry from the United States or Canada, depression, and participation in cultural activities were associated with greater HLS and HLAS scores, indicating a greater number of losses and associated symptoms. Results suggest a need to consider historical trauma when designing diabetes prevention interventions and the need to further consider ancestry differences. As preventive efforts for Indigenous adults expand in urban environments, behavioral interventions must incorporate strategies that address community-identified barriers in order to succeed.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/114cd39895eeb976f482ee8537713b425d3d9f37,114cd39895eeb976f482ee8537713b425d3d9f37,"[{'authorId': '1416744110', 'name': 'Patricia Rodríguez Espinosa'}, {'authorId': '2111900434', 'name': 'Luis C Garcia'}, {'authorId': '1491074367', 'name': 'Jan J.

An Empirical Study on Volatility of the US Stock Market and Co-movement between Stock Markets in the NAFTA Countries in the Context of Sino-US Trade Friction,": In this paper, an optimal GARCH model conforming to a single market is selected from the GARCH family models, and based on this model, the change in the volatility trend of the US stock market during the Sino-US trade friction is observed. Then, the DCC-GARCH parameter model is employed to conduct an empirical study on the co-movement of daily return rates in the stock markets of three countries in the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA), based on which the following conclusions are drawn: During the intensified Sino-US trade friction, firstly, the US stock market was not significantly affected by key events, and therefore the investors in the US stock market could lower their expectation of the impact of Sino-US trade friction on the short-term stock price volatility when assessing the investment risks. Secondly, there was an observable difference in the co-movement between any two of the stock markets of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The stock market co-movement between the United States and Canada is high. As a result, investment diversification in Canada stock market is not ideal in spreading investment risk for the U.S market; And the co-movement between the United States and Mexico and that between Canada and Mexico are relatively low. Thirdly, with the impact of the intensified Sino-US trade friction on economic uncertainty, the dynamic co-movement between the stock markets of the United States and the NAFTA countries is increasing, and key events will have a significant impact on the dynamic co-movement between the stock markets.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2c064ce5f0b93350935be6bda14247a8a7741393,2c064ce5f0b93350935be6bda14247a8a7741393,"[{'authorId': '2185014571', 'name': 'Haoyu Chen'}, {'authorId': '144854841', 'name': 'Xin Zhao'}]"

Estimation of competitiveness indicators in avocado importing markets,"Objective: The main objective of the work was to analyze the competitiveness of avocados produced in Mexico during the study period from 1995 to 2019 in the world market, derived from the production surplus.
Design/Methodology/Approach: The methodological design contemplated the use of trade competitiveness indicators at the level of importing world markets, the Revealed Comparative Advantage Index and the Normalized Revealed Comparative Advantage Index were calculated, data on avocado exports were analyzed as well as total agricultural exports made by Mexico to the world, and specifically to countries such as the United States, Canada and Japan.
Results: The results obtained suggest that avocado production in Mexico is highly competitive at the international level.
Study Limitations/Implications: The importance of making an analysis of the main avocado production variables was to locate the situation of products coming from Mexico with respect to the world situation.
Findings/Conclusions: Internationally, Mexican avocado production stood out in first place, with 2.4 million tons and 1.3 million tons of avocado were destined for export in 2019, contributing more than 45% of the world export market. These exports represented a very significant percentage of avocado imports in countries such as the United States of America, Canada, Japan, Europe and Central America.

Household Food Insecurity in Middle- and High-Income Countries Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"
 Objectives
 The impact of the pandemic on the prevalence of food insecurity is unclear given the potentially contradictory effects of shocks such as lockdowns versus stabilizers such as income supplements. We examined changes in the prevalence of household food insecurity in five countries from before (2019) to during the pandemic (2020).
 
 Methods
 Data were drawn from cross-sectional surveys conducted in Australia, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US) in November/December of 2018,2019, and 2020. Adults aged 18–99 years were surveyed annually (2018: n = 22,731,2019: n = 19,274,2020: n = 21,323). Household food insecurity in the past 12 months was assessed using the Household Food Security Survey Module. Weighted logit models examined changes in the prevalence of living in households affected by food insecurity from 2019 to 2020, adjusting for the prevalence in 2018 and demographic characteristics. Weighted generalized logit models examined changes in the severity of food insecurity.
 
 Results
 Adults in Mexico had a higher probability of living in food-insecure households in 2020 compared to 2019 (β = 0.14, p = 0.02). In contrast, decreases in the probability of living in food-insecure households in 2020 compared to 2019 were observed in Australia (β = –0.21, p < .001) and Canada (β = –0.14, p = 0.03). In the UK and the US, no important changes in the prevalence of food insecurity were observed (UK: β = –0.11, p = 0.11, US: β = 0.05, p = 0.42). Changes in the severity of food insecurity within countries are also evident.
 
 Conclusions
 Changes in the prevalence of household food insecurity during the pandemic appear to differ across countries. Further analyses will contextualize these differences in relation to varied policy responses to the pandemic, as well as changes in prevalence among subgroups such as those with low incomes.

Inspired by the interdisciplinary opportunity offered by digital humanities practice, a research collaborative linked to the MSU Library Digital Scholarship Lab (DSL) developed a Collections as Data project focused on the Comic Art Collection. This team extracted and cleaned over forty-five thousand MARC records describing comics published in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The dataset is openly available through a GitLab repository, where the team has shared data visualizations so that scholars and members of the public can explore and interrogate this unique collection. In order to bridge digital humanities with the popular culture legacy of the institution, the MSU comics community turned to bibliographic metadata as a new way to leverage the collection for scholarly analysis. In October 2020, the Department of English Graphic Possibilities Research Workshop gathered a group of scholars, librarians, Wikidatians, and enthusiasts for a virtual Wikidata edit-a-thon. This project report will present this event as a case study to discuss how linked open metadata may be used to create knowledge and how community knowledge can, in turn, enrich metadata.

Intergovernmental Yet Dynamically Expansive: Concordance Legalization as an Alternative Regional Trading Arrangement in ASEAN and Beyond,"
 The conventional regional trading arrangement landscape holds two primary models. One is the ‘dynamically expansive supranational model’ of the European Union (EU) that progressively enlarges its community beyond the constituent treaty through its evolving laws and institutions. The other is the ‘static intergovernmental model’ of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) where members strictly uphold obligations in the original agreement – no more and no less. A certain genre of Asia-Pacific regional trading arrangements (and beyond in the global South) sits uncomfortably within this bifurcated landscape. Sovereignty-centric, they seek a dynamic and ever-expanding community like the EU but, firmly rejecting supranationalism, insist on intergovernmental modalities as seen in the USMCA. Unsurprisingly, they have not been effective. Using post-2007 integration data from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, this article presents concordance legalization as a new explanatory framework in this landscape, demonstrating how one can regionalize successfully despite being simultaneously agenda expansive and intergovernmentally operational. Concordance legalization’s four-pronged strategy – the constituent treaty explicitly entrenching intergovernmentalism to facilitate dynamic agenda expansion; the dual-step system of primary and secondary laws (with a carefully calibrated use of hard and soft instruments); the organizational hierarchy that expands, implements and exerts intra-regional accountability pressures through numerous meetings and monitoring mechanisms (rather than adjudication) that enforce compliance – has enabled this curious success.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/42edbb872608e7aa6f31f98e375714bdf2660fcb,42edbb872608e7aa6f31f98e375714bdf2660fcb,"[{'authorId': '116740177', 'name': 'Hsien-Li Tan'}]"
Understanding the OECD Model of Tax Convention: The Lesson of History,"An important recent development in international taxation is the publication of the OEEC (the forerunner of the OECD when it was a purely European organization, although representatives from the United States and Canada were also present at the discussions on tax treaties) archives on the development of tax treaties in a website http://www.taxtreatieshistory.org/ organized by the Institute for Austrian and International Tax Law, Vienna, IBFD, Universith Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Piacenza, Italy, IFA Canadian Branch and the Canadian Tax Foundation. While this may sound like a rarefied topic, the OEEC period from 1956 to 1961 is the story of the making of the current OECD Model. Previously there was a gap in the published sources after the end of the League of Nations Mexico and London Models of 1943 and 1946, which suffered from the wartime domination by the South Americans of the Mexico Model, and the Europeans doing what they could in the London Model to reverse some of the worst excesses. By the time of the OEEC it was accepted that this was not the way of the future. After the London Model there was previously a complete gap in the history until the publication of the 1963 OECD Draft, which is essentially the OECD Model as we have it today. True there have been many changes in the meantime, particularly to the Commentary, but when compared to the whole edifice these are merely tinkering. The 1963 OECD Draft seemed to have arrived from nowhere and one wondered how this arose. Now, with the publication of the OEEC archives, we know. It was the work of (ultimately) 15 Working Parties (plus another dealing with estate taxes) of the Fiscal Committee each comprising delegates from two countries working on a separate article of the Model and reporting to the other countries at regular meetings of the Fiscal Committee. The results were most impressive and one can trace how the articles developed. The minutes are available as transcribed versions in English and French together with a pdf file of the original minutes so that, for example, alterations can be seen. A few of the current problems can be traced to the technique of working on each article separately with, for example, the definitions article being started late and not being published in any of the Fiscal Committee's four reports. In that respect the League of Nations method of working was superior. For example, the other income article, which is effectively the general rule that had come first in the original League of Nations drafts, appears at the end because Working Party 14 started much later. I believe that we still have a mutual agreement provision in the tie-breaker for individuals because that article was drafted before the mutual agreement article. In addition some of the less obvious overlaps were not considered.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64605ea8782b6bf058f040baa514c1c9e95c8214,64605ea8782b6bf058f040baa514c1c9e95c8214,"[{'authorId': '2164656694', 'name': 'John F.

Study on the influencing factors of wheat import trade in China,"Wheat is one of the three major food crops in China, and wheat production plays an important role in people's lives and industrial development. China is the world's largest consumer of products and also a leading wheat trading country. However, the production of low-quality wheat in some regions, large trade deficit, and excessive concentration of import sources have troubled the development of China's wheat industry. In this study, the import trade pattern of wheat was studied, and the gravity model of trade and Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) estimator were used to conduct an empirical analysis on the factors influencing wheat import trade. From 2010 to 2020, China gradually formed an import pattern mainly involving Australia and Canada and supplemented by the United States, France, and Kazakhstan. Mexico, Argentina, and other countries gradually withdrew from trading wheat with China. Among the factors affecting China's wheat import trade, China's per capita GDP and total imports, geographical distance, current GDP of exported countries, and last year's wheat output have a significant impact. In addition, climate factors also had a significant impact on China's wheat imports.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0db2dc99cd6fd52fff62d5b3f3f9d4005751d339,0db2dc99cd6fd52fff62d5b3f3f9d4005751d339,"[{'authorId': '66166419', 'name': 'Yu-cong Sun'}, {'authorId': '2004678178', 'name': 'Shuang Hu'}, {'authorId': '2109623852', 'name': 'Zhi-run Li'}, {'authorId': '95812278', 'name': 'J.

Extensive species diversification and marked geographic phylogenetic structure in the Mesoamerican genus Stenopelmatus (Orthoptera: Stenopelmatidae: Stenopelmatinae) revealed by mitochondrial and nuclear 3RAD data,"Abstract The Jerusalem cricket subfamily Stenopelmatinae is distributed from south-western Canada through the western half of the United States to as far south as Ecuador. Recently, the generic classification of this subfamily was updated to contain two genera, the western North American Ammopelmatus, and the Mexican, and central and northern South American Stenopelmatus. The taxonomy of the latter genus was also revised, with 5, 13 and 14 species being respectively validated, declared as nomen dubium and described as new. Despite this effort, the systematics of Stenopelmatus is still far from complete. Here, we generated sequences of the mitochondrial DNA barcoding locus and performed two distinct DNA sequence-based approaches to assess the species' limits among several populations of Stenopelmatus, with emphasis on populations from central and south-east Mexico. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among representative species of the main clades within the genus using nuclear 3RAD data and carried out a molecular clock analysis to investigate its biogeographic history. The two DNA sequence-based approaches consistently recovered 34 putative species, several of which are apparently undescribed. Our estimates of phylogeny confirmed the recent generic update of Stenopelmatinae and revealed a marked phylogeographic structure within Stenopelmatus. Based on our results, we propose the existence of four species-groups within the genus (the faulkneri, talpa, Central America and piceiventris species-groups). The geographic distribution of these species-groups and our molecular clock estimates are congruent with the geological processes that took place in mountain ranges along central and southern Mexico, particularly since the Neogene. Our study emphasises the necessity to continue performing more taxonomic and phylogenetic studies on Stenopelmatus to clarify its actual species richness and evolutionary history in Mesoamerica.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28c42c411a0d484a38eb1908246baeaebb75d55c,28c42c411a0d484a38eb1908246baeaebb75d55c,"[{'authorId': '1402550816', 'name': 'J.

Awareness of and Participation in School Food Programs Among Youth From Six Countries.,"BACKGROUND
School-based meal programs may promote healthy dietary intake among youth. However, limited data exist regarding the impact of income-targeted school meal programs across countries, particularly among food insecure youth.


OBJECTIVES
To examine self-reported awareness of and participation in free school meal programs, and associations with dietary intake among youth from six countries with differing national school meal policies.


METHODS
Data were collected through the 2019 International Food Policy Study (IFPS) Youth Survey, a cross-sectional survey of 10,565 youth aged 10-17 y from Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). Regression models examined: 1) country differences in awareness of and participation in breakfast and lunch programs; and 2) associations between lunch program participation and intake of fruit and vegetables, and 'less healthy' foods during the previous school lunch day.


RESULTS
Awareness of and participation in free breakfast and lunch programs varied across countries. Approximately half of US and Chilean students participated in school lunch programs-the countries with the most comprehensive national policies-compared to one fifth of students in the UK, and approximately 5% in Australia, Canada, and Mexico (P < 0.001 for all contrasts). In the US and Chile, more than two thirds of youth with the highest level of food insecurity participated in lunch programs, compared to 45% in the UK, 27% in Canada, and 20% or less in Australia and Mexico. In all countries, youth reporting school lunch program participation were more likely to report fruit and vegetable intake during their previous school lunch (P < 0.001), and higher intake of 'less healthy' food in all countries except the US and Chile.


CONCLUSIONS
More comprehensive national policies were associated with greater participation in school meals programs, particularly among youth at greatest risk of food insecurity, as well as healthier dietary intake from school lunch.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fb4e2881d6dfc19ff1e67481275b40b384e1035b,fb4e2881d6dfc19ff1e67481275b40b384e1035b,"[{'authorId': '2140831534', 'name': 'Karen Hock'}, {'authorId': '4981463', 'name': 'S.

Stock Market Volatility and the COVID-19 Pandemic in Emerging and Developed Countries: An Application of the Asymmetric Exponential GARCH Model,"The objective of this research is to analyze the influence of COVID-19 on the return and volatility of stock market indices of emerging and developed countries (Brazil, Canada, United States, France, India, and Mexico) using an asymmetric exponential GARCH model. The daily returns of the market indices from January 2019 to December 2020 were considered. The results reveal negative average daily returns for all stock market indices during the first period of the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020 to June 2020). Although the second half of the pandemic period (2020) reflects a recovery of all indices with altered strengths, volatility remains higher than in normal periods, signaling a bearish trend in the market. The variable COVID-19 has been shown to have a positive impact on the volatility of stock returns for all indices, i.e., indicating increased volatility in the analyzed stock markets. In addition, it is also found that the COVID variable has a negative impact on average returns only in the stock market of Brazil and France.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4701ea6efe45c710dadb476f36db173dd027d3c,f4701ea6efe45c710dadb476f36db173dd027d3c,"[{'authorId': '2149097000', 'name': 'C.

Extreme Winter Precipitation Regimes in Eastern North America: Synoptic-Scale and Thermodynamic Environments,"
We define extreme precipitation regimes (EPRs) during the eastern North American winter based on widespread and persistent heavy precipitation, using ERA5 precipitation data from 1979 to 2020. We find 62 EPRs and analyze their synoptic-scale and thermodynamic environments. EPRs impact most of eastern North America with heavy precipitation, especially from Louisiana to Quebec, and generally last for five to eight days. They are associated with an anomalously strong 500-hPa trough/ridge over western/eastern North America that travels slowly eastward, favoring intrusions of moist, tropical air into eastern North America, and a strong baroclinic zone from the central United States to Atlantic Canada. They are also characterized by high frequencies of cyclones in the midwestern United States, anticyclones over eastern Canada and subtropical Atlantic, and atmospheric rivers (ARs) in eastern North America. Precipitation is maintained by large moisture influxes, primarily from the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, from the EPR start to the time midway through the EPR period. The influxes are often associated with ARs feeding into cyclones, where the moisture falls as precipitation. We also categorize EPRs based on the spatial anomaly correlation (AC) of synoptic-scale weather patterns between individual EPRs and the EPR composite. High AC EPRs have similar but stronger 500-hPa features over North America, greater moisture flux from the Gulf of Mexico and inland precipitation over eastern North America, farther inland cyclone track, higher frequency of subtropical Atlantic anticyclones, and lower EPR-to-EPR variability than low AC EPRs.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1121c62cc6b59ae507da6ecc1510c3036ba4d59d,1121c62cc6b59ae507da6ecc1510c3036ba4d59d,"[{'authorId': '2179682239', 'name': 'Yeechian Low'}, {'authorId': '1829540', 'name': 'J.

Review of “Refuge: How the State Shapes Human Potential”,"his pithy text explains how different types of welfare systems in the United States, Canada, and Germany shape the ability of recently arrived Syrian refugees to develop and deploy their human capital. Gowayed puts refugee families front and center. Their own stories, cutting insights into the absurdity of their circumstances, and poetic expressions of hope and loss richly illustrate the processes of disruption that continue for years after reaching a host country. The writing is lucent and aimed at engaging spirited debate. The book would be suitable for undergraduate and graduate course adoption. The project is based on participant observation and interviews with 43 Syrian families and individuals displaced by the civil war in 3 countries: 18 in New Haven, 5 in Toronto, and 20 spread across Berlin, Cologne, Stuttgart, and Regensberg. The advantage of this comparative strategy is to highlight how refugees of the same nationality who fled similar circumstances at roughly the same time face different obstacles in each host setting, thus highlighting how national institutions shape the possibilities and boundaries of refugees’ economic mobility. Thetext acknowledges that the quasi-experimental logic of comparison is not entirely clean. Two of the cases (the United States and Canada) involve overseas resettlement programs in which states working in tandem with the UN Refugee Agency and International Organization for Migration select refugees from abroad and arrange their transportation to the host country, where they receive temporary resettlement benefits. In the German case, the vast majority of Syrians in the country, and everyone in the sample, arrived at Germany’s borders on their own as asylum seekers, not resettled refugees, and were granted asylum or subsidiary protection. Consistently sampling resettled refugees, even if the numbers in Germany are small, would have held the type of program constant, probably yielded a sample of refugees with less variation in their pre-existing human capital, and made it easier to tease out the particularities of each country",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e5ab4b600105a959d4a75f7b130e1bfa2a35e65a,e5ab4b600105a959d4a75f7b130e1bfa2a35e65a,"[{'authorId': '47049372', 'name': 'D.

Modeling the Spatial Development of the US Cross-Border Regions as Mesolevel Socio-Economic Systems,"The cross-border nature of the spatial development of economically and socially significant regions identified in the geospace of the largest federal states of the modern world necessitates their study from the standpoint of the mesoeconomics of development as complex, open and dynamic systems in space-time. The object of this study is the cross-border regions of the United States with Mexico and Canada, which are distinguished by a characteristic set of specific properties of both system-structural and socio-economic nature. According to the systemic economic theory, the identified cross-border regions of the United States show the principle of duality of spatial development, and within the framework of evolutionary theory – ​a specific “socio-economic genotype” of the territory. Using elements of mesoeconomic modeling, the author identified and substantiated some trends in the spatial development of different groups of cross-border regions of the United States over a long time period of 1970–2020 and as a forecast until 2030. Based on a comparative analysis carried out on the results of modeling and testing, the author's hypothesis about a multidirectional change in the dynamics of indicators of socio-economic spatial development, which depends on the regional features of the spatiotemporal evolution of specific transboundary territories, is confirmed – ​as socio-economic systems of the mesolevel. The obtained results, revealing the spatial dependence of the data, indicate the growth of spatial relationships of both social and economic nature within the studied cross-border regions of the United States, which determine the spatiotemporal evolution of the latter in the geoeconomic and geocultural space of the United States and neighboring states. Based on the results of mesoeconomic modeling, the existence of an evolutionary-cyclical nature and duality of the studied mesosystems is empirically confirmed, having their own socio-economic genotype of territories, depending on the insurmountable specifics of spatial diversity and unevenness in the conditions of the market organization of American society. The main conclusion is that regional interest, which has dialectical unity and variability, manifested over time, causes different directions and levels of spatial development of specific regions of the United States as integral dynamic and open socio-economic systems of the mesoterritorial level, reflecting the gradual increase in economic regionalization. The approach used, taking into account the specifics of spatial development, is of interest for the study of similar subject issues in relation to large federal states that have a transboundary nature of genetically determined socio-economic interaction.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/140991880d4ee7e8c1a1db07638a2fbdeb752cf4,140991880d4ee7e8c1a1db07638a2fbdeb752cf4,"[{'authorId': '1659309497', 'name': 'V.

Population Structure and Genetic Diversity of the Pepper Weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) Using the COI Barcoding Region,"Abstract The pepper weevil Anthonomus eugenii Cano (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a pest of economic importance for Capsicum species pepper in North America that attacks the reproductive structures of the plant. The insect is distributed across Mexico, the United States, and the Caribbean, and is occasionally found during the pepper growing season in southern Ontario, Canada. Continuous spread of the insect to new areas is partially the result of global pepper trade. Here, we describe the genetic diversity of the pepper weevil using the mitochondrial COI barcoding region across most of its geographic range. In this study, 44 (H1–H44) highly similar haplotypes were identified, the greatest number of haplotypes and haplotype diversity were observed among specimens from its native Mexico, followed by specimens from the United States. Unlike Mexico, a low haplotype diversity was found among specimens from Canada, the Dominican Republic, Italy, and the Netherlands. Out of these 44 haplotypes, 29 are reported for the first time. Haplotype diversity in the Canadian population suggests either multiple and continuous introductions of the pepper weevil into this area or a single introduction of genetically diverse individuals. We discuss the importance of such population genetic data in tailoring pepper weevil management programs, using Canada as an example.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e44d289bfbf9f5ec080eac97029182a02813a45,3e44d289bfbf9f5ec080eac97029182a02813a45,"[{'authorId': '49772894', 'name': 'D.

For the subnational index, Economic Freedom of North America employs 10 variables for the 92 provincial/state governments in Canada, the United States, and Mexico in three areas: (1) Government Spending, (2) Taxes, and (3) Regulation. In the case of the all-government index, we incorporate three additional areas at the federal level from Economic Freedom of the World Annual Report: (4) Legal Systems and Property Rights, (5) Sound Money, and (6) Freedom to Trade Internationally. In addition, we expand area 1 to include government investment, area 2 to include top marginal income and payroll tax rates, and area 3 to include credit market regulation and business regulations. These additions help capture restrictions on economic freedom that are difficult to measure at the provincial/state and municipal/local level.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bac8d957509f93404dcfaf32dad6b878d969e62f,bac8d957509f93404dcfaf32dad6b878d969e62f,"[{'authorId': '103776563', 'name': 'Dean Stansel'}, {'authorId': '1580384236', 'name': 'J.

International Trade and Maritime Transport in North America: An Analysis of Productivity and Foreign Direct Investment,"Port logistics activity is a vital element in foreign trade. In a globalized environment that demands greater competitiveness, trade agreements and synergies between trade blocs through maritime transport allow commercial development between economies. This research analyzes the relationship between international trade through seaports and investment in the countries that make up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) from 1997 to 2017. An econometric panel data model is used to measure the relationship between the variables, and unit root tests, cointegration tests (Kao and Fisher-Johansen tests), and heterogeneous causality tests (Hurlin and Dumitrescu test) are performed. The results show a positive relationship between trade and productivity, as well as a positive relationship between commerce and direct foreign investment; hence, an increase in investment causes a growth in international trade between Mexico, the United States, and Canada.

Determining Factors and their Impacts on the Ratings of Companies and Countries,"In the face of the latest world financial crises, the ratings released by the regulatory agencies have gained distinction in the financial market.  This paper proposes models to predict the future ratings of companies and countries. The analysis was carried out using quarterly data from 2010 to 2018 from companies in Brazil, South Africa, Germany, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, South Korea, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Peru, the United Kingdom, Russia, and India. The sample's number of companies and countries is limited to the availability of rating information and the other model information. We use the panel-ordered logit model for classifying the rating and the other economic and financial variables as an independent.  The results show that the financial and economic variables are essential to predict the rating of financial and non-financial companies in Brazil as well as the sovereign rating of the sample countries. The predictive capacity of the models reached values close to 80%, emphasizing the forecasts of large banks with 94% accuracy. For the country sample, the results are close to 80% accuracy. With the results of the research, improvement in the financial and economic indicators and the increase in the predictive capacity of the market agents for the prior determination of future ratings of financial companies are expected.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04a21acd325b7d4d01f8e79682c5a4e96c0c11d7,04a21acd325b7d4d01f8e79682c5a4e96c0c11d7,"[{'authorId': '94108152', 'name': 'F.

Millions of Monarch Butterflies and the Quest to Count Them,"Monarchs are capable of amazing feats! They transition from caterpillars to beautiful butterflies. During migration, they fly for thousands of miles—from the northern part of the United States and southern Canada to Mexico. But monarch butterflies are in trouble. In the past 25 years, citizens and scientists have reported fewer and fewer of them. There were less than half as many monarchs in 2020 as in 2019. Parks across the United States, like Rocky Mountain and Indiana Dunes National Parks, host the monarchs along their migration paths. The park rangers are helping scientists track monarchs through “capture, tag, and release.” With this method, anyone who sees a tagged butterfly can report when and where they saw it. By tracking monarchs along their migration paths, we expect to learn where they run into problems. Scientists are also using new technology to count monarchs in their winter habitats.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18694e3984d923c841f1ea0bed55a0032814bfb1,18694e3984d923c841f1ea0bed55a0032814bfb1,"[{'authorId': '2069356766', 'name': 'S.

Duty Evasion in Free Trade Agreements: Norm Emergence and Implications,"Despite the failure of states to adopt multilateral rules to address the circumvention of anti-dumping and countervailing duties, efforts have more recently been deployed by the United States to focus on the issue of ‘duty evasion’. After failed attempts to discuss the issue at the World Trade Organization (WTO), the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) specifically addresses cooperation between Parties regarding information sharing and duty evasion verification requests with a view to ensuring the enforcement of trade remedy laws. Can the elaboration of duty evasion provisions in regional trade agreements facilitate the negotiation of rules to address the issue of anti-circumvention at the multilateral level? This article argues that the motivations and inherent limits underlying the USMCA duty evasion provisions are most likely to impede broad adoption at the multilateral level. It proceeds in two steps. First, while the United States is playing a pivotal role as a norm entrepreneur in the emergence of these duty evasion provisions, the article demonstrates a clear evolution in its strategy toward a populist approach to international economic policy. Second, after identifying similarities with other provisions, the article addresses the lacunae in the USMCA duty evasion provisions from a legal perspective.

The former two species are widely distributed in the eastern United States and southeastern Canada. We confirm the presence of P. blancardella in the Pacific Northwest, earliest records being from Oregon in 1985, Washington in 1 986, and British Columbia in 1 987. Phyllonorycter mespilella occurs over much of western North America, from California north to British Columbia, and east to Utah and New Mexico. Phyllonorycter elmaella is known from Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. Lithocolletis malimalifoliella Braun is synonymized under P. crataegella. Records of Phyllonorycter sorbi (Frey) in North America and of P. scudderella (Frey and Boll) on apple are regarded as erroneous.

World Economy of Winemaking,"Old traditional winemaking countries are now ahead of new winemaking countries. In addition to countries with European and Middle Eastern viticultural traditions, wine production has begun on a large scale in Canada, Australia, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia and the Americas. The top wine exporters in 2019 are dominated by international wine trade in Italy, Spain and France - the total of 57.1 million hectoliters, which is 54% of the global market. Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States were the largest importers - a total of 40.4 million hectoliters, accounting for 38% of the global market. These three countries account for 39% of the total value of world wine imports, amounting to 11.9 billion euros. The US is the largest consumer of wine in the world, with a record level of 33.0 million hectoliters in 2019.

"Editor's Comment 38, no. 1 / Nota del editor 38, no. 1","Welcome to our first issue of 2022. As is customary, we combine the publication of research on important topics in Mexican studies from different disciplines with essays that address timely issues that resonate with contemporary public discussions. In this vein, the first part of this volume includes four essays ranging from Afrodescent royal tributes during Spanish colonial times to disputes about the Colorado River water resources along the US-Mexico border, the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City, and literature production by and about “narco-bandits” in contemporary times. The second part contains a thematic section about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Mexican workers in agriculture and low-income service occupations in the United States and Canada. In the first essay, historian Norah L. A. Gharala unveils the ways in which women of African descent navigated the colonial taxation system in New Spain to lessen payments of royal tribute. As we learn, the taxation system symbolized Afrodescent women’s social status as vassals of the Spanish crown, with burdensome taxation because of their genealogy and gender, which reduced their wealth and hurt their families. Based on archival research, Gharala shows how women heightened their marital connections to build petition cases for tax exemption. In so doing, Gharala argues, they contributed to build a better future for their children while also reshaping traditional colonial discourses about family, belonging, and community. In the next essay, Marloes Mekenkamp analyzes the book Me dicen “el más loco,” an autobiography of Nazario Moreno González, the leader of the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana. From the interdisciplinary perspective of cultural studies, Mekenkamp argues that the book merges a Christian version of the myth of social banditry with narrative strategies of classic picaresque novels such as the Lazarillo de Tormes to provoke empathy in the reader. This type of narrative also contributed to the popular sanctification of Nazario in the public view after he was allegedly killed by the federal police in 2010.

Binational Panel Review of Trade Remedies Determinations: Prospects for Exporting the USMCA’s Unique Procedure,"The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) contains a distinctive procedure under which anti-dumping and countervailing duty determinations by national agencies can be reviewed by an ad hoc binational panel established under the treaty as an alternative to domestic court review. Binational panel review was first adopted in the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement (Canada-US FTA) to respond to Canada’s concern that the administration of the US anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws by the US agencies was biased in favour of the US domestic industries and the review of agency determinations by the US courts was inadequate to address that bias. Continuing Canadian concerns, shared by Mexico, resulted in binational panel review being included in the USMCA, even though the US had sought to eliminate it. Compared to US judicial review, binational panels under the Canada-US FTA and its successor, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), have resulted in more frequent remands of the US agency determinations often leading to lower (or even zero) duties in anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases. As well, the prospect of rigorous panel review has discouraged the filing of anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases, the commencement of anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations, and the imposition of duties in relation to imports from Canada and Mexico. Adopting binational panel review in other treaty contexts would be most attractive where significant concerns about domestic agencies comparable to Canada’s are present and national anti-dumping and countervailing duty regimes in participating countries have similar structures and procedures for judicial review.

Individuals recording clinical encounters,"Background: Clinicians and their employers, concerned with privacy and liability, are often hesitant to support the recording of clinical encounters. However, many people wish to record encounters with healthcare professionals. It is therefore important to understand how existing law applies to situations where an individual requests to record a clinical encounter.Methods: We searched for and reviewed relevant legal documents that could apply to recording clinical encounters. We limited the scope by purposefully examining relevant law in nine countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States. We analyzed legal texts for consents needed to record a conversation, whether laws applied to remote or face-to-face conversations and penalties for violations.Findings: Most jurisdictions have case law or statutes, derived from a constitutional right to privacy, or a wiretapping or eavesdropping statute, governing the recording of private conversations. However, little to no guidance exists on how to translate constitutional principles and case law into advice for people seeking to record their medical encounters.Interpretation: The law has not kept pace with people’s wish to record clinical interactions, which has been enabled by the arrival of mobile technology.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f92d6ed431e98e0219c73b9ec9d71b74e37f4786,f92d6ed431e98e0219c73b9ec9d71b74e37f4786,"[{'authorId': '1732830', 'name': 'G.

Babesiosis and Theileriosis in North America,"Babesia and Theileria are apicomplexan parasites that cause established and emerging diseases in humans, domestic and wild animals. These protozoans are transmitted by Ixodid ticks causing babesiosis or theileriosis, both characterized by fever, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. In North America (NA), the most common species affecting humans is B. microti, which is distributed in the Northeastern and Upper Midwestern United States (US), where the tick vector Ixodes scapularis is established. In livestock, B. bovis and B. bigemina are the most important pathogens causing bovine babesiosis in tropical regions of Mexico. Despite efforts toward eradication of their tick vector, Rhipicephalus microplus, B. bovis and B. bigemina present a constant threat of being reintroduced into the southern US and represent a continuous concern for the US cattle industry. Occasional outbreaks of T. equi, and T. orientalis have occurred in horses and cattle, respectively, in the US, with significant economic implications for livestock including quarantine, production loss, and euthanasia of infected animals. In addition, a new species, T. haneyi, has been recently discovered in horses from the Mexico-US border. Domestic dogs are hosts to at least four species of Babesia in NA that may result in clinical disease that ranges from subclinical to acute, severe anemia. Herein we review the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and epidemiology of the most important diseases caused by Babesia and Theileria to humans, domestic and wild animals in Canada, the US, and Mexico.",2022,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5d0ee96f34aa484dcb3bffe7e3fbf4c37a2004fd,5d0ee96f34aa484dcb3bffe7e3fbf4c37a2004fd,"[{'authorId': '4342064', 'name': 'Consuelo Almazán'}, {'authorId': '7274861', 'name': 'Ruth C.

“It’s About Walking Alongside a Family”: Practitioner Perspectives on Caregiver Coaching With Families of Children Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing,"Practitioners use caregiver coaching in early intervention services, but coaching principles and practices are not well understood in the context of listening and spoken language (LSL) services with families of children who are deaf or hard of hearing. The purpose of this study was to examine practitioners’ experiences with coaching, including definitions, training, and practices they use in their work with families. Using semi-structured, qualitative interviews and video observation discussions, this study examined the perspectives of 14 practitioners providing LSL services to families at three intervention sites in the United States and Canada. Results indicate that practitioners’ underlying beliefs about their coaching proficiency and caregivers’ capacity impact their coaching practices and how they engage with caregivers. Results highlight practices such as mentoring and accountability that supported practitioners’ coaching skills. This study contributes to the understanding of caregiver coaching in LSL practice and has implications for practitioners working to improve their coaching skills, which may improve LSL services and optimize child outcomes.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b7693fd64e831ab7fceee3accbdd59093c64523,2b7693fd64e831ab7fceee3accbdd59093c64523,"[{'authorId': '116285083', 'name': 'Dorie Noll'}, {'authorId': '39482365', 'name': 'Sheila Moodie'}, {'authorId': '108178269', 'name': 'I.

Aggregated occurrence records of invasive European frog-bit (Hydrocharismorsus-ranae L.) across North America,"Abstract Background European frog-bit (Hydrocharismorsus-ranae L.; EFB) is a free-floating aquatic plant invasive in Canada, the United States and India. It is native to Europe and northern and western Asia and is believed to have first been introduced to North America in Ottawa, Ontario in 1932. It has since spread by way of the St. Lawrence River and connected waterways to southern Ontario and Quebec and parts of the northern United States. Invasive European frog-bit occurs in freshwater coastal wetlands and inland waters, where it can form dense mats that have the potential to limit recreational and commercial use of waterways, alter water chemistry and impact native species and ecosystems. Data on the past and present distribution of this invasive species provide geospatial information that can be used to infer the pattern of invasion and inform management and monitoring targeted at preventing secondary spread. Our EFB dataset contains 12,037 preserved specimen and observation-based occurrence records, including 9,994 presence records spanning two Canadian provinces and ten U.S. states and 2,043 absence records spanning five U.S. states. The aggregated EFB dataset provides a curated resource that has been used to guide a Michigan management strategy and provide information for ongoing efforts to develop invasion risk assessments, species distribution models and decision-support tools for conservation and management. New information Specimen-based and observation-based occurrence data were accessed through nine digital data repositories or aggregators and three primary sources. Twenty-six percent of the data are new records not previously published to a data repository or aggregator prior to this study. We removed duplicate data and excluded records with incorrect species identifications. Occurrence records without coordinates were georeferenced from recorded locality descriptions. Data were standardised according to Darwin Core. This aggregated dataset is the most complete account of EFB occurrence records in its North American invasive range.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/abb72dec9742fa66cce7a8d6e07cee9d1350c227,abb72dec9742fa66cce7a8d6e07cee9d1350c227,"[{'authorId': '86993915', 'name': 'S.

Mixing Metabolisms: New People in Aging Sprawl,"The historically white postwar suburbs of the United States and Canada are now the first destination for new residents from abroad. Because they are relatively safe, affordable, and, as they became ethnic enclaves, culturally familiar, these peripheral communities, have gradually replaced the center city as the desired landing place for new arrivals. Using scholarly and popular literature with empirical field observation, this paper examines a set of aging postwar suburbs in California and one in Arizona to illustrate the largely positive effects of such immigration. In addition to an injection of diverse and energized cultures, the changes can point towards a set of materially strategic options for renewing all aging low density-built environments. Such cultural shifts are an opportunity to imagine a socially healthy, though repurposed, and spatially altered, future for all aging urban peripheries. Finally, regarding the development of a productive architectural and urban discourse on the subject, it is vital to note that the current nascent transformation in aging postwar environments is common to that of many cities and settlements throughout history. More specific to the case of renewal of postwar sprawl with its’ increase in the density of social interaction, the current ethnic changes to the settlement pattern often make the largely private built environments of Anglo-American suburbs more “urban” and in the process reveal a more nuanced definition of this term.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3da57903b6615e567601eadb67fc9d5483abc6b9,3da57903b6615e567601eadb67fc9d5483abc6b9,"[{'authorId': '2280447906', 'name': 'Lawrence Davis'}]"
Transfusion Ratios and Deficits in Injured Children With Life-Threatening Bleeding*,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of plasma and platelet ratios and deficits in injured children with life-threatening bleeding. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the MAssive Transfusion epidemiology and outcomes In Children study dataset, a prospective observational study of children with life-threatening bleeding events. SETTING: Twenty-four childrens hospitals in the United States, Canada, and Italy. PATIENTS: Injured children 0–17 years old who received greater than 40 mL/kg total blood products over 6 hours or were transfused under activation of massive transfusion protocol. INTERVENTION/EXPOSURE: Weight-adjusted blood product volumes received during the bleeding event were recorded. Plasma:RBC ratio (plasma/RBC weight-adjusted volume in mL/kg) and platelet:RBC ratio (platelet/RBC weight-adjusted volume in mL/kg) were analyzed. Plasma deficit was calculated as RBC mL/kg – plasma mL/kg; platelet deficit was calculated as RBC mL/kg – platelet mL/kg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 191 patients analyzed, median (interquartile range) age was 10 years (5–15 yr), 61% were male, 61% blunt mechanism, and median (interquartile range) Injury Severity Score was 29 (24–38). After adjusting for Pediatric Risk of Mortality score, cardiac arrest, use of vasoactive medications, and blunt mechanism, a high plasma:RBC ratio (> 1:2) was associated with improved 6-hour survival compared with a low plasma:RBC ratio (odds ratio [95% CI] = 0.12 [0.03–0.52]; p = 0.004). Platelet:RBC ratio was not associated with survival. After adjusting for age, Pediatric Risk of Mortality score, cardiac arrest, and mechanism of injury, 6-hour and 24-hour mortality were increased in children with greater plasma deficits (10% and 20% increased odds of mortality for every 10 mL/kg plasma deficit at 6 hr [p = 0.04] and 24 hr [p = 0.01], respectively); 24-hour mortality was increased in children with greater platelet deficits (10% increased odds of 24-hr mortality for every 10 mL/kg platelet deficit [p = 0.02)]). CONCLUSIONS: In injured children, balanced resuscitation may improve early survival according to this hypothesis generating study. Multicenter clinical trials are needed to assess whether clinicians should target ratios and deficits as optimal pediatric hemostatic resuscitation practice.",2022,16,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/935375b8ef4b668bf5f502f18fa54abb81102c5c,935375b8ef4b668bf5f502f18fa54abb81102c5c,"[{'authorId': '4372881', 'name': 'P.

Kelpwatch: A new visualization and analysis tool to explore kelp canopy dynamics reveals variable response to and recovery from marine heatwaves,"Giant kelp and bull kelp forests are increasingly at risk from marine heatwave events, herbivore outbreaks, and the loss or alterations in the behavior of key herbivore predators. The dynamic floating canopy of these kelps is well-suited to study via satellite imagery, which provides high temporal and spatial resolution data of floating kelp canopy across the western United States and Mexico. However, the size and complexity of the satellite image dataset has made ecological analysis difficult for scientists and managers. To increase accessibility of this rich dataset, we created Kelpwatch, a web-based visualization and analysis tool. This tool allows researchers and managers to quantify kelp forest change in response to disturbances, assess historical trends, and allow for effective and actionable kelp forest management. Here, we demonstrate how Kelpwatch can be used to analyze long-term trends in kelp canopy across regions, quantify spatial variability in the response to and recovery from the 2014 to 2016 marine heatwave events, and provide a local analysis of kelp canopy status around the Monterey Peninsula, California. We found that 18.6% of regional sites displayed a significant trend in kelp canopy area over the past 38 years and that there was a latitudinal response to heatwave events for each kelp species. The recovery from heatwave events was more variable across space, with some local areas like Bahía Tortugas in Baja California Sur showing high recovery while kelp canopies around the Monterey Peninsula continued a slow decline and patchy recovery compared to the rest of the Central California region. Kelpwatch provides near real time spatial data and analysis support and makes complex earth observation data actionable for scientists and managers, which can help identify areas for research, monitoring, and management efforts.",2022,15,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9b27b0b1c15ee31d3cdabfbcf4f8f1436fdad506,9b27b0b1c15ee31d3cdabfbcf4f8f1436fdad506,"[{'authorId': '144658282', 'name': 'T.

Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators (PALISI): Evolution of an Investigator-Initiated Research Network,"The Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators (PALISI) Network originated over 20 years ago to foster research to optimize the care of critically ill infants and children. Over this period, PALISI has seen two major evolutions: formalization of our network infrastructure and a broadening of our clinical research focus. First, the network is unique in that its activities and meetings are funded by subscriptions from members who now comprise a multidisciplinary group of investigators from over 90 PICUs all over the United States (US) and Canada, with collaborations across the globe. In 2020, the network converted into a standalone, nonprofit organizational structure (501c3), making the PALISI Network formally independent of academic and clinical institutions or professional societies. Such an approach allows us to invest in infrastructure and future initiatives with broader opportunities for fund raising. Second, our research investigations have expanded beyond the original focus on sepsis and acute lung injury, to incorporate the whole field of pediatric critical care, for example, efficient liberation from mechanical ventilator support, prudent use of blood products, improved safety of intubation practices, optimal sedation practices and glucose control, and pandemic research on influenza and COVID-19. Our network approach in each field follows, where necessary, the full spectrum of clinical and translational research, including: immunobiology studies for understanding basic pathologic mechanisms; surveys to explore contemporary clinical practice; consensus conferences to establish agreement about literature evidence; observational prevalence and incidence studies to measure scale of a clinical issue or question; case control studies as preliminary best evidence for design of definitive prospective studies; and, randomized controlled trials for informing clinical care.

Lung Cancer and Radon: Pooled Analysis of Uranium Miners Hired in 1960 or Later,"Background: Despite reductions in exposure for workers and the general public, radon remains a leading cause of lung cancer. Prior studies of underground miners depended heavily upon information on deaths among miners employed in the early years of mine operations when exposures were high and tended to be poorly estimated. Objectives: To strengthen the basis for radiation protection, we report on the follow-up of workers employed in the later periods of mine operations for whom we have more accurate exposure information and for whom exposures tended to be accrued at intensities that are more comparable to contemporary settings. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis of cohort studies of lung cancer mortality among 57,873 male uranium miners in Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, and the United States, who were first employed in 1960 or later (thereby excluding miners employed during the periods of highest exposure and focusing on miners who tend to have higher quality assessments of radon progeny exposures). We derived estimates of excess relative rate per 100 working level months (ERR/100 WLM) for mortality from lung cancer. Results: The analysis included 1.9 million person-years of observation and 1,217 deaths due to lung cancer. The relative rate of lung cancer increased in a linear fashion with cumulative exposure to radon progeny (ERR/100 WLM=1.33; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.88). The association was modified by attained age, age at exposure, and annual exposure rate; for attained ages <55  y, the ERR/100 WLM was 8.38 (95% CI: 3.30, 18.99) among miners who were exposed at ≥35  years of age and at annual exposure rates of <0.5 working levels. This association decreased with older attained ages, younger ages at exposure, and higher exposure rates. Discussion: Estimates of association between radon progeny exposure and lung cancer mortality among relatively contemporary miners are coherent with estimates used to inform current protection guidelines. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10669",2022,20,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/51a741a4abf0188b8439818b009268b7ee4f87cb,51a741a4abf0188b8439818b009268b7ee4f87cb,"[{'authorId': '145393861', 'name': 'D.

Variation in Peritoneal Dialysis Time on Therapy by Country,"Visual Abstract Background and objectives Quantifying contemporary peritoneal dialysis time on therapy is important for patients and providers. We describe time on peritoneal dialysis in the context of outcomes of hemodialysis transfer, death, and kidney transplantation on the basis of the multinational, observational Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS) from 2014 to 2017. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Among 218 randomly selected peritoneal dialysis facilities (7121 patients) in the PDOPPS from Australia/New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, we calculated the cumulative incidence from peritoneal dialysis start to hemodialysis transfer, death, or kidney transplantation over 5 years and adjusted hazard ratios for patient and facility factors associated with death and hemodialysis transfer. Results Median time on peritoneal dialysis ranged from 1.7 (interquartile range, 0.8–2.9; the United Kingdom) to 3.2 (interquartile range, 1.5–6.0; Japan) years and was longer with lower kidney transplantation rates (range: 32% [the United Kingdom] to 2% [Japan and Thailand] over 3 years). Adjusted hemodialysis transfer risk was lowest in Thailand, but death risk was higher in Thailand and the United States compared with most countries. Infection was the leading cause of hemodialysis transfer, with higher hemodialysis transfer risks seen in patients having psychiatric disorder history or elevated body mass index. The proportion of patients with total weekly Kt/V ≥1.7 at a facility was not associated with death or hemodialysis transfer. Conclusions Countries in the PDOPPS with higher rates of kidney transplantation tended to have shorter median times on peritoneal dialysis. Identification of infection as a leading cause of hemodialysis transfer and patient and facility factors associated with the risk of hemodialysis transfer can facilitate interventions to reduce these events.

Association between pre-pregnancy multimorbidity and adverse maternal outcomes: A systematic review,"Objective We reviewed the literature on the association between pre-pregnancy multimorbidity (co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions) and adverse maternal outcomes in pregnancy and postpartum. Data sources Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched from inception to September, 2021. Study selection Observational studies were eligible if they reported on the association between ≥ 2 co-occurring chronic conditions diagnosed before conception and any adverse maternal outcome in pregnancy or within 365 days of childbirth, had a comparison group, were peer-reviewed, and were written in English. Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers used standardized instruments to extract data and rate study quality and the certainty of evidence. A narrative synthesis was performed. Results Of 6,381 studies retrieved, seven met our criteria. There were two prospective cohort studies, two retrospective cohort studies, and 3 cross-sectional studies, conducted in the United States (n=6) and Canada (n=1), and ranging in size from n=3,110 to n=57,326,681. Studies showed a dose-response relation between the number of co-occurring chronic conditions and risk of adverse maternal outcomes, including severe maternal morbidity or mortality, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and acute health care use in the perinatal period. Study quality was rated as strong (n=1), moderate (n=4), or weak (n=2), and the certainty of evidence was very low to moderate.

Climate change influences on the geographic distributional potential of the spotted fever vectors Amblyomma maculatum and Dermacentor andersoni,"Amblyomma maculatum (Gulf Coast tick), and Dermacentor andersoni (Rocky Mountain wood tick) are two North American ticks that transmit spotted fevers associated Rickettsia. Amblyomma maculatum transmits Rickettsia parkeri and Francisella tularensis, while D. andersoni transmits R. rickettsii, Anaplasma marginale, Coltivirus (Colorado tick fever virus), and F. tularensis. Increases in temperature causes mild winters and more extreme dry periods during summers, which will affect tick populations in unknown ways. Here, we used ecological niche modeling (ENM) to assess the potential geographic distributions of these two medically important vector species in North America under current condition and then transfer those models to the future under different future climate scenarios with special interest in highlighting new potential expansion areas. Current model predictions for A. maculatum showed suitable areas across the southern and Midwest United States, and east coast, western and southern Mexico. For D. andersoni, our models showed broad suitable areas across northwestern United States. New potential for range expansions was anticipated for both tick species northward in response to climate change, extending across the Midwest and New England for A. maculatum, and still farther north into Canada for D. andersoni.",2022,13,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e750982fe22ac7290f2bd9a2e1fb00a8b9a15f2f,e750982fe22ac7290f2bd9a2e1fb00a8b9a15f2f,"[{'authorId': '30418531', 'name': 'Abdelghafar Alkishe'}, {'authorId': '1827111', 'name': 'A.

Incidence of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Lower Respiratory Tract Infections During the First 2 Years of Life: A Prospective Study Across Diverse Global Settings,"Abstract Background The true burden of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains unclear. This study aimed to provide more robust, multinational data on RSV-LRTI incidence and burden in the first 2 years of life. Methods This prospective, observational cohort study was conducted in Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, Finland, Honduras, South Africa, Thailand, and United States. Children were followed for 24 months from birth. Suspected LRTIs were detected via active (through regular contacts) and passive surveillance. RSV and other viruses were detected from nasopharyngeal swabs using PCR-based methods. Results Of 2401 children, 206 (8.6%) had 227 episodes of RSV-LRTI. Incidence rates (IRs) of first episode of RSV-LRTI were 7.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.88–9.08), 5.50 (95% CI, 4.21–7.07), and 2.87 (95% CI, 2.18–3.70) cases/100 person-years in children aged 0–5, 6–11, and 12–23 months. IRs for RSV-LRTI, severe RSV-LRTI, and RSV hospitalization tended to be higher among 0–5 month olds and in lower-income settings. RSV was detected for 40% of LRTIs in 0–2 month olds and for approximately 20% of LRTIs in older children. Other viruses were codetected in 29.2% of RSV-positive nasopharyngeal swabs. Conclusions A substantial burden of RSV-LRTI was observed across diverse settings, impacting the youngest infants the most. Clinical Trials Registration.

Effectiveness of emissions standards on automotive evaporative emissions in Europe under normal and extreme temperature conditions,"Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are primary precursors for the formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosol which contribute to increased public health risks. Throughout Europe, passenger vehicles contribute significantly to NMVOC emissions due to automotive evaporative emissions controls that are less stringent than those in the United States, Canada, China, and Brazil. Evaporative NMVOC emissions increase significantly, and associated air quality impacts are exacerbated, during periods of high temperature such as heatwaves, which continue to increase in frequency, duration, and intensity. Adoption of strict evaporative emission standards and controls such as onboard refueling vapor recovery systems (ORVR) can significantly reduce evaporative emissions during such events; however, emissions inventories used to inform policy decisions are developed using average temperature profiles which fail to capture the impact of heatwave events on evaporative emissions. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the previous generation (Euro5), current (Euro6d), and proposed (Euro7) emission control standards on evaporative emissions at high temporal and spatial resolution in western and central Europe during July 2019, a month in which a significant heatwave swept through the region. Using temperatures obtained from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with observation data and an improved method for estimating evaporative emissions, it is estimated that per-vehicle evaporative NMVOC emissions within the study domain and period are reduced by 25.0% under current Euro6d standards and controls relative to Euro5 standards, and that proposed Euro7 controls, including ORVR, would provide an additional 35.3% emissions reduction relative to Euro6d. During heatwave periods, Euro7 controls demonstrate improved attenuation of temperature-driven emissions increases relative to Euro6d controls, with associated emissions within the study period and domain increasing by 23.4% on average under Euro7 controls versus 29.4% under Euro6d controls. While this study does not quantify the effect of heatwaves and emissions controls on total annual emissions, the results for the study period of July 2019, combined with the low implementation cost of proposed Euro7 evaporative controls and projected continued dominance of petrol vehicles in the European fleet through the middle of this century, suggest that significant NMVOC emissions reductions and associated air quality and health impacts are achievable through the adoption of these more stringent standards and control systems.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50ee11617a232bd0a90d0e5f35ac44d19cadd3bf,50ee11617a232bd0a90d0e5f35ac44d19cadd3bf,"[{'authorId': '40908506', 'name': 'M.

Modulation of North American Heat Waves by the Tropical Atlantic Warm Pool,"Heat waves are among the deadliest natural hazards affecting the United States (US). Therefore, understanding the physical mechanisms modulating their occurrence is essential for improving their predictions and future projections. Using observational data and model simulations, this study finds that the interannual variability of the tropical Atlantic warm pool (AWP, measured as the area enclosed by the 28.5°C sea surface temperature isotherm) modulates heat wave occurrence over the US Great Plains during boreal summer. For example, a larger than normal AWP enhances atmospheric convection over the Caribbean Sea, driving an upper tropospheric anticyclonic anomaly over the Gulf of Mexico and Great Plains, which strengthens subsidence, reduces cloud cover, and increases surface warming. This circulation anomaly thus weakens the Great Plains low‐level jet and associated moisture transport into the Great Plains, leading to drought conditions and increased heat wave occurrence for most of the US east of the Rockies.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c79b31c76c8871594633b2988864614a0a707a9,6c79b31c76c8871594633b2988864614a0a707a9,"[{'authorId': '48561318', 'name': 'H.

"International Icodextrin Use and Association with Peritoneal Membrane Function, Fluid Removal, Patient and Technique Survival","Key Points There are important national and center differences in the prescription of icodextrin, with the United States a clear outlier; across all countries, icodextrin was more likely to be used if membrane function tests indicated reduced ultrafiltration capacity to glucose. This large, international observational study was unable to show patient or hemodialysis transfer advantages to icodextrin use. Where use of icodextrin was low, this was compensated for by much greater use of high glucose and overall higher ultrafiltration volumes at each level of urine volume; this practice may confound associations between icodextrin and survival outcomes. Visual Abstract Background Icodextrin has been shown in randomized controlled trials to benefit fluid management in peritoneal dialysis (PD). We describe international icodextrin prescription practices and their relationship to clinical outcomes. Methods We analyzed data from the prospective, international PDOPPS, from Australia/New Zealand, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Membrane function and 24-hour ultrafiltration according to icodextrin and glucose prescription was determined at baseline. Using an instrumental variable approach, Cox regression, stratified by country, was used to determine any association of icodextrin use to death and permanent transfer to hemodialysis (HDT), adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, serum albumin, urine volume, transplant waitlist status, PD modality, center size, and study phase. Results Icodextrin was prescribed in 1986 (35%) of 5617 patients, >43% of patients in all countries, except in the United States, where it was only used in 17% and associated with a far greater use of hypertonic glucose. Patients on icodextrin had more coronary artery disease and diabetes, longer dialysis vintage, lower residual kidney function, faster peritoneal solute transfer rates, and lower ultrafiltration capacity. Prescriptions with or without icodextrin achieved equivalent ultrafiltration (median 750 ml/d [interquartile range 300–1345 ml/d] versus 765 ml/d [251–1345 ml/d]). Icodextrin use was not associated with mortality (HR=1.03; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.48) or HDT (HR 1.2; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.57). Conclusions There are large national and center differences in icodextrin prescription, with the United States using significantly less. Icodextrin was associated with hypertonic glucose avoidance but equivalent ultrafiltration, which may affect any potential survival advantage or HDT.",2022,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/78a79c6d77180381b8fa4eaf0f2a991821446c4e,78a79c6d77180381b8fa4eaf0f2a991821446c4e,"[{'authorId': '47889149', 'name': 'S.

"Atmospheric, Water and Acoustic Pollution from Hydrocarbon Activities in the American Continent: A Literature Review","Hydrocarbon activities over the years have been one of the main sources of environmental pollution, creating short and long-term impacts. This study aims to analyze the scientific production of the American continent through a bibliographic review of scientific articles published from the 1970s to the present, in order to contrast relevant scientific information about the types of pollution, water, atmospheric, and acoustic, published in the most important scientific repositories in the world, such as Scopus and Web of Science. The Prisma methodology was adopted for its development. From the plethora of articles collected, a sample of 3879 scientific articles was extracted, from which 3322 of them were excluded, leaving 557 records with remarkable information such as: country, year of publication, type of contamination, remediation if applicable, the associated oil & gas sector, and publication registration on the indexed website. It was noted that the countries with the highest scientific production are the United States, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. Furthermore, the Web of Science, unlike Scopus, contains more indexed publications related to the types of contamination objects relevant to this study.

Effectiveness of Vortioxetine in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder in Real-World Clinical Practice: French Cohort Results from the Global RELIEVE Study,"Aim Functional recovery is an important treatment goal in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The Real-Life Effectiveness of Vortioxetine in Depression (RELIEVE) study assessed the effectiveness of vortioxetine in patients with MDD receiving treatment in routine clinical care settings in France, Italy, Canada, and the United States. This paper presents the study data for the cohort enrolled in France. Methods RELIEVE was a 6-month, international, observational, prospective cohort study in outpatients initiating vortioxetine treatment for MDD at their physician’s discretion (NCT03555136). Patients were assessed at routine clinic visits at study entry (baseline) and after 12 and 24 weeks of vortioxetine treatment. The primary study outcome was patient functioning, assessed by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Secondary outcomes included depression severity (assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]), cognitive symptoms (assessed by the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire-Depression [PDQ-D-5]), and cognitive performance (Digit Symbol Substitution Test [DSST]). Changes from baseline to week 24 were assessed using mixed models for repeated measures, adjusted for relevant confounders. Adverse events spontaneously reported by the patient or observed by the investigator were recorded. Results Data are available for 184 patients in France (mean age, 50.2 years; 65.2% female). Overall, 67.9% of patients had at least one comorbidity and 46.2% reported current anxiety symptoms at baseline. Adjusted least-squares mean (standard error) change in SDS score from baseline to week 24 was −10.9 (0.6) points (P < 0.001). Respective changes for PHQ-9, PDQ-D-5 and DSST scores were −9.3 (0.5), −6.1 (0.4), and +6.9 (1.0) points (all P < 0.0001). Adverse events were reported by 29 patients (15.8%), most commonly nausea (11 patients, 6.0%).

Self-Reported Data and Physician-Reported Data in Patients With Eosinophilic Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis: Comparative Analysis,"Background Patient-based registries can help advance research on rare diseases such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), a complex multiorgan form of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitis. Objective The aim of this study is to compare patient-reported and physician-reported data on manifestations, treatments, and outcomes for patients with EGPA. Methods We completed a comparative analysis of patients ≥18 years with EGPA in Canada and the United States from the following 2 cohorts: (1) The Vasculitis Patient-Powered Research Network (VPPRN), a self-enrolled secure portal with patient-entered data updated quarterly (2014-2019) and (2) the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC) observational studies, a physician-entered database (2003-2019) of patients who fulfilled the 1990 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for EGPA. The studied parameters included demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, ANCA status, treatments, and relapses. Results Data from 195 patients with a validated diagnosis of EGPA in the VPPRN and 354 patients enrolled in the VCRC were analyzed. Compared to the VCRC cohort, the patients in the VPPRN cohort were more likely to be female (135/195, 69.2% compared to 209/354, 59%; P=.02) and younger at diagnosis (47.3 compared to 50.0 years; P=.03); both cohorts reported similar frequencies of asthma (177/184, 96.2% in the VPPRN cohort compared to 329/354, 92.9% in the VCRC cohort; P=.13) and cardiac manifestations (44/153, 28.8% compared to 75/354, 21.2%; P=.06), but the VPPRN cohort reported less frequent lung manifestations other than asthma and more frequent disease manifestations in all other organ systems. The ANCA positivity was 48.9% (64/131) in the VPPRN patients compared to 38.9% (123/316; P=.05) in the VCRC cohort. Relapsing disease after study enrollment was reported in 32.3% (63/195) of patients in the VPPRN compared to 35.7% (99/277) of patients in the VCRC. Most therapies (GC, cyclophosphamide, mepolizumab) were used at similar frequencies in both groups, except for rituximab with VPPRN patients reporting more use than the VCRC cohort (47/195, 24.1% compared to 29/277, 10.5%; P<.001). Conclusions Overall, patients and physicians report manifestations of EGPA at similar frequencies. However, observed differences between patient and physician reports imply the potential occurrence of selection biases. These results support the use of patient-reported data in EGPA but also the need for careful consideration of disease-specific definitions for the study of EGPA and how patient- and physician-reported data are collected.

Registered clinical trials on addiction: a cross-sectional study on ClinicalTrials.gov,"Abstract Objective Clinical trials drive the development of medicine. However, little is known about the current status of clinical trials on addiction. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of registered addiction-related trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. Methods We examined all addiction-related trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov up to March 23, 2020. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS 25.0, and a two-sided p < .05 was considered statistically significant. Results 370 eligible trials were identified. Over half of trials were completed, while only 13.8% of trials reported results. Sample sizes varied a lot with a median number of 84 per trial. Universities were the primary sponsor for 164 (44.3%) trials, followed by hospitals (96, 26.0%). Compared to trials without results, more trials with results were sponsored by universities (62.7% vs. 41.4%, p = .003), and conducted in United States/Canada (90.2% vs. 48.3%, p < .001). Most interventional trials were randomized with a parallel assignment, and 56.3% were blinded. Thirty one (41.3%) observational trials were cohort studies and 12 (16.0%) were case-only studies. Interventional trials were more likely to be funded by the US Government, while more observational trials were supported by industries. Trials funded by the US Government were more likely to be completed than those funded by other sources (p = .009).

Abstract 12740: Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mortality in Patients Presenting With STEMI With COVID-19: NACMI Registry,"
 Introduction:
 COVID-19 infection disproportionally impacts non-Whites with higher morbidity and mortality. However, differences by race and ethnicity in COVID-19 patients with concomitant STEMI have not been previously described.
 
 
 Methods:
 The North American COVID-19 STEMI (NACMI) registry is a prospective, observational registry enrolling COVID-19 patients with concomitant STEMI from 64 centers in Canada and the United States from March 2020 to December 2021. We compared clinical characteristics, treatment strategies, and in-hospital mortality risks by race/ethnicity.
 
 
 Results:
 Among 679 STEMI patients with concomitant COVID-19, 54.5% were White, 14.3% Black, 19.4% Hispanic/Latinx, and 11.8% Asian/Indigenous/Other. Blacks had the highest prevalence of current smokers, and Whites had the lowest prevalence of diabetes. The rate of high-risk features including cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and inotropic support was comparable between the groups. Presence of infiltrates and cardiomegaly was higher in Blacks and Hispanic/Latinx; whereas, COVID-19 severity was similar in the groups. Blacks and Hispanic/Latinx and Blacks were more likely to not have coronary angiography performed. Among patients that underwent angiography, Whites and Hispanic/Latinx were more likely to be treated with primary PCI. In-hospital mortality was highest in Hispanic/Latinx (38%) and the Asian/Indigenous/Other group
 (Table).
 
 
 Conclusions:
 Despite no difference in high-risk features in patients with COVID-19 and STEMI, there was a significant difference in in-hospital mortality between Whites and non-Whites with highest risk in Hispanic/Latinx and Asian/Indigenous/Other. Further research in needed to explore discrepant outcomes in racial/ethnic minorities in this patient population and the role of discrepant management.

Remittances flow to India and its impact on growth over three decades since 1991,"In many developing countries, remittance payments from migrant workers are observed as an increasing magnitude and becoming a significant source of foreign reserve earnings. Remittances inflow is noted to be very useful in promoting household welfare, health, and education particularly in developing countries. Inflows of remittances to India have experienced a sharp rise in last three dictates. Remittances have also emerged as a more important and stable source of foreign exchange inflow compared to official development assistance, foreign direct investment or other types of capital flows in particular in developing countries.Among countries today, the top recipient countries are India with $79 billion, followed by China ($67 billion), Mexico ($36 billion), the Philippines ($34 billion), and Egypt ($29 billion) (World Bank 2019).Available evidences indicate that migrant labour flows from India since 1990s have not only registered impressive growth, in respect of the traditional destinations like United States of America (USA), United Kingdom (UK), Canada and the Gulf countries but also have diversified and expanded to newly emerging migrant destinations in continental Europe (Germany, France, Belgium), Australasia (Australia, New Zealand), East Asia (Japan) and South-East Asia (Singapore, Malaysia).In this study we have concentrated on the long-run relationship between remittances inflow and the economic growth of India considering annual data over the period 1975-2016,In this purpose we have used VAR (The vector auto regression) model for estimating the significance relationship and the direction of the relationship.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/620b6e20e31531ea9e4adcf7890612a65d24a0a9,620b6e20e31531ea9e4adcf7890612a65d24a0a9,"[{'authorId': '103608942', 'name': 'A.

Enhancing Therapeutic Processes in Videoconferencing Psychotherapy: Interview Study of Psychologists’ Technological Perspective,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic caused a surge in the use of telehealth platforms. Psychologists have shifted from face-to-face sessions to videoconference sessions. Therefore, essential information that is easily obtainable via in-person sessions may be missing. Consequently, therapeutic work could be compromised. Objective This study aimed to explore the videoconference psychotherapy (VCP) experiences of psychologists around the world. Furthermore, we aimed to identify technological features that may enhance psychologists’ therapeutic work through augmented VCP. Methods In total, 17 psychologists across the world (n=7, 41% from Australia; n=1, 6% from England; n=5, 29% from Italy; n=1, 6% from Mexico; n=1, 6% from Spain; and n=2, 12% from the United States) were interviewed. We used thematic analysis to examine the data collected from a sample of 17 psychologists. We applied the Chaos Theory to interpret the system dynamics and collected details about the challenges posed by VCP. For collecting further information about the technology and processes involved, we relied on the Input-Process-Output (IPO) model. Results The analysis resulted in the generation of 9 themes (input themes: psychologists’ attitude, trust-reinforcing features, reducing cognitive load, enhancing emotional communication, and engaging features between psychologists and patients; process themes: building and reinforcing trust, decreasing cognitive load, enhancing emotional communication, and increasing psychologist-patient engagement) and 19 subthemes. Psychologists found new strategies to deal with VCP limitations but also reported the need for more technical control to facilitate therapeutic processes. The suggested technologies (eye contact functionality, emergency call functionality, screen control functionality, interactive interface with other apps and software, and zooming in and out functionality) could enhance the presence and dynamic nature of the therapeutic relationship. Conclusions Psychologists expressed a desire for enhanced control of VCP sessions. Psychologists reported a decreased sense of control within the therapeutic relationship owing to the influence of the VCP system. Great control of the VCP system could better approximate the critical elements of in-person psychotherapy (eg, observation of body language). To facilitate improved control, psychologists would like technology to implement features such as improved eye contact, better screen control, emergency call functionality, ability to zoom in and out, and an interactive interface to communicate with other apps. These results contribute to the general perception of the computer as an actual part of the VCP process. Thus, the computer plays a key role in the communication, rather than remaining as a technical medium. By adopting the IPO model in the VCP environment (VCP-IPO model), the relationship experience may help psychologists have more control in their VCP sessions.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ef4c641b4d9ad736673a02f9c29c1dbe5cc856a,2ef4c641b4d9ad736673a02f9c29c1dbe5cc856a,"[{'authorId': '2073195506', 'name': 'F.

"Fear, Justice, and Modern True Crime","tions of decolonial feminist activism—for Black liberation, for intersectional and intergenerational climate justice, and for reproductive justice. These chapters present hopeful, medicinal elements of an anthology that traces the daunting brutalities that persist in our heteropatriarchal, racial-colonial-capitalist societies. This section of the volume ends with a powerful coauthored chapter (by Aleyda Marisol Cervantes Gutierrez et al.) that will be of interest to student activists, as it details student-led movements on university campuses today, emphasizing students’ power to build movements rooted in collective liberation and connected to larger genealogies of antiracist feminist struggle, from Ferguson (United States) to Ayotzinapa (Mexico), Chile, South Africa, and beyond. To conclude the collection, Part VI (‘‘Narrative as Activism’’) examines how literature and storytelling by Black, Indigenous, queer, and diasporic writers and artists respond to gendered colonial violence and thus create social change. Chapters explore how Arab women filmmakers use film as a decolonial force, even as they contend with colonial structures of access and funding (May Telmissany); how academics of color experience and resist the racialized structure of academia (Clelia O. Rodrı́guez); and a poetic narrative of experiences of colonialism and slavery in Canada (El Jones). The final chapter in Gendering Globalization, Globalizing Gender, Sara Ahmed’s ‘‘A Killjoy Manifesto,’’ provides its closing argument, an artful invitation into the discomfort and refusal that are required of decolonial feminist praxis. Ahmed writes, ‘‘Manifestos are often disagreeable because they show the violence necessary to sustain an agreement. It is not just that the feminist killjoy has a manifesto. The feminist killjoy is a manifesto’’ (p. 361). Ahmed’s manifesto reflects the ethos of this collection: one that refuses violence, including that of normative scholarly paradigms. As a whole, the volume’s authors offer feminist analyses of the global that are rigorously antiracist and anti-colonial, making this a collection that moves feminist scholarship in a necessary direction and is in line with contemporary abolitionist movements that increasingly contest liberal, colonial, and carceral feminisms. Ahmed writes, ‘‘There are so many ways to cause a feminist disturbance’’ (p. 367). Gendering Globalization, Globalizing Gender, a killjoy manifesto in its own right, disturbs mainstream traditions in global and feminist studies brilliantly. I hope sociologists teaching about globalization, gender, and racism assign it, study it carefully with students, and support their efforts to translate its insights into radical praxis.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/17b89d36ab54eae75f6c366f2fa6d20bd69e972a,17b89d36ab54eae75f6c366f2fa6d20bd69e972a,"[{'authorId': '118403850', 'name': 'L.

Editorial: Research in nursing homes in the time of COVID,"effort in human history. The drama experienced in longterm care facilities (LTCFs) during the epidemic period must however raise questions about the ability of the scientific community to find specific solutions for the oldest and most vulnerable people living in LTCFs in a timely manner. Many epidemiological works carried out in developed countries such as France, the United States, Spain, Italy, Canada alarmed the medical community on a major number of deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 in LTCFs (1). Schematically, about 30% of all deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 concern residents of LTCFs (2,3). This high percentage of deaths within a very minority subgroup of the population (1% of the French population) contrasts with the low number of scientific studies involving residents of LTCFs. A quick search on the PudMed. gov website proves it. By filtering on the research carried out on “humans”, only 694 references emerge by associating the keywords “nursing home” and “COVID-19” (less with “longterm care facility”). This number is derisory (around 0.49%) compared to the 141,237 results obtained with the keyword “COVID-19” alone. To put it another way, 1 in approximately 200 COVID-related manuscripts to date relate to residents of LTCFs. Of course, this observation can be balanced by the research which, without focusing specially on the population living in LTCFs, has led to advances in the care of people living in LTCFs. Research on vaccination is one example among others. However, should we not again be surprised that before the massive and priority vaccination of the residents of LTCFs, none were included in the original work that led to the implementation of the vaccination against SARS-Cov-19 in all institution worldwide? To date, only 5 Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) have been published on COVID-19 in “nursing home”. In the initial phase, the preventive measures implemented in the LTCFs relied on common sense and were mainly empirical (4). Yet, the severity of the epidemic in the LTCFs due to (i) the specificities of the population but also (ii) the organizational characteristics of the institutions justify a strong commitment for research work to bring improved geriatric medicine and quality of care in LTC during the pandemic. The very high age of the residents, their multiple morbidities, their undernutrition explain their immunosuppression and the high rate of deaths. The very high prevalence of neuro-degenerative diseases in LTCFs, often at severe stage and complicated with psychobehavioral disorders such as wandering compromise the feasibility in applying protective measures and in particular in wearing the mask. Finally, community life, in closed spaces, sometimes old and poorly ventilated, is conducive to the spread of the virus. The conjunction of these three factors (patients at very high risk of severe COVID-19/impossibility of applying health rules/promiscuity of many individuals in a closed place), made it possible, from the start of the pandemic in spring 2020, to announce a disaster in LTCFs. To this observation must be added the insufficient number of health care professional, their low level of training and equipment and sometimes the insufficient support provided by hospital staff overwhelmed by the workload in the emergency room. Despite the need for research data in LTCF, many challenges must be overcome to conduct high-quality research in LTCF. More than ever, evidence-based medicine should guide the practices of caregivers in LTCFs and improve the care of residents. However, the pandemic has added challenges to an already difficult research to conduct in LTCF. In a systematic review, Lam et al. (5) report the multiples challenges, constraints and specificities of research in LTCFs. Among the challenges to be met, it is worth mentioning the increased costs of research in LTCFs compared to the community and few funding opportunities for research projects, the high turnover of health care professionals and residents, the heterogeneity of residents, the difficulty of recruitment to participate in research and in particular the obstacles to obtaining consent and assent of residents (in cognitively impaired residents with or without legal guard, among other ethical challenges), barriers related to relatives who are afraid of research and who do not want their relatives to be involved in clinical research, poor or complicated access to imaging or lab exams, low number and overloaded health care professional. Moreover, the directors and administrative officers of the LTCFs do not know the world of research and show little interest. Research in LTCF also generates concern that the data collected from residents and health care professional may lead to criticism or even controls of regulatory guardianship (6).

Introductory Remarks: Spotlight on Spotted-Wing Drosophila,"Native to Asia, spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae), invaded the continental U.S. in 2008. Since then, D. suzukii has become a key economical pest of raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and cherries in the United States and worldwide. Not surprisingly, the number of publications has proliferated from 29 publications as of 2010 to 978 additional publications between 2011 and 2021 from a Web of Science search for ‘Drosophila suzukii.’ While many publications are available, this special collection will highlight advances in D. suzukii pest management since its U.S. invasion. We solicited papers by open call and received 66 abstracts, and selected 14 papers covering: 1) review, 2) monitoring and risk, 3) behavioral control, 4) biological control, 5) cultural control, and 6) chemical control. This collection includes authors from Austria, Brazil, Canada, Italy, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the United States that represent perspectives from universities, federal and state laboratories, growers, and pest product companies. Given that 14 yr of research has accumulated since the continental U.S. invasion, it was fitting to include two reviews that provide a different scope than was covered in prior reviews on D. suzukii biological control (Lee et al. 2019, Wang et al. 2020), trapping (Burrack et al. 2020), cultural control (Schöneberg et al. 2021), and chemical ecology (Cloonan et al. 2018). This special collection is anchored by Tait et al. (2021), a review of the most promising methods as part of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy against D. suzukii across the world since 2008. The effectiveness, impact, sustainability, and present stage of development and implementation are discussed for each of the considered techniques, and insights for continued development are presented. A second review in this special collection by Garcia et al. (2022) summarizes the history and current status of D. suzukii in Latin America. The authors first provide a history of the D. suzukii invasion through Latin American countries, which started in 2011 in Mexico, and is now present in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay. They describe the host plants where D. suzukii has been found as well as advances in monitoring, biological control, chemical control, cultural control, and in the sterile insect technique. The authors posit that this information can serve as the basis for developing sustainable area-wide management programs in Latin America. As with any pest, monitoring and risk assessment are critical for decision-making and avoiding excess sprays. Here, Wilson et al. (2022) describe a 2-yr field/laboratory study to determine when tart cherry would be susceptible to D. suzukii. They found the growing degree-day threshold where field-grown cherries would not be susceptible to D. suzukii under no-choice conditions, which was confirmed by field observations. Though tart cherries are grown in temperate regions, this approach could be used for other susceptible crops in other locations. Fermentation baits have been used for monitoring D. suzukii since their invasion of Europe and the Americas (rev. by Cloonan et al. 2018) with comparisons often done in one or two seasons. Here, Whitener et al. (2022) test common commercially available lures and homemade fermenting recipes over a 5-yr period. One of the commercial lures was consistently more attractive, and another commercial lure was consistently more selective. Their results guide users in selecting a lure/bait depending on the seasonality, need for selectivity, and other constraints. As our understanding of D. suzukii increases, researchers have focused on using microbes for trapping and behavioral manipulation (Hamby and Becher 2016). Here, Becher et al. (2022) examine Hanseniaspora uvarum Niehaus, a yeast closely associated with D. suzukii, as a substrate for the development of lures that could be more specific and attractive than current nonspecific fermentation products. Findings from flight tunnel and field trapping studies confirm that the presence of behaviorally-active components from H. uvarum headspace extracts and a synthetic blend of compounds provide specificity that may result in more selective monitoring of D. suzukii in the field.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/43e1b6d178ab4bff1a822fc5bddc8d88dea6acbd,43e1b6d178ab4bff1a822fc5bddc8d88dea6acbd,"[{'authorId': '1576792405', 'name': 'Jana C.

Precisión de la calculadora de riesgo quirúrgico ACS NSQIP para predecir morbilidad y mortalidad en pacientes mexicanos.,"BACKGROUND
American College of Surgeons (ACS) developed the ACS NSQIP surgical risk calculator that predicts the results of elective and emergency surgical procedures. This tool has been useful improving the morbidity and mortality in hospitals in the United States and Canada.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the usefulness of the ACS NSQIP risk calculator for predicting postoperative complications in Mexican population.


METHOD
Prospective, observational, analytical study. Patients undergoing abdominal surgery were recorded, 21 preoperative variables were captured and entered into the calculator. They were followed up to 30 days postoperatively, identifying 14 types of postoperative complications.


RESULTS
109 patients were registered. A comparison was made between the calculated and observed complications, obtaining a good correlation in the complications of cardiac arrest, surgical site infection, reoperation, sepsis and mortality (p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
ACS NSQIP risk calculator is useful in the Mexican population, since the score obtained predicts most postoperative complications including mortality.

The Best (and Worst) of 2022,"Theatrical film had a difficult time in the United States in 2022. Large-scale spectacles such as Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis (USA/Australia, 2022) and Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s Everything Everywhere All at Once (USA, 2022) sold plenty of tickets and recouped their production and marketing costs nicely, but a striking number of artistically ambitious pictures fared poorly at the box office despite favorable reviews and strong promotional campaigns. While some observers blamed the coronavirus pandemic for the downturn in attendance for the year’s more high-minded releases, the solid performance of pictures like Joseph Kosinski’s Top Gun: Maverick (USA, 2022) and Jordan Peele’s Nope (USA/Canada/Japan, 2022) indicated that moviegoers were willing to attend theaters despite covid when they felt the experience would be enjoyable. Others pinned the decline on the growing popularity of streaming platforms, especially when films were available via streaming during or soon after their theatrical releases. Whatever the cause, the results were unmistakable. According to a New York Times report in December, James Gray’s Armageddon Time (USA/Brazil, 2022) earned $1.9 million against its cost of approximately $30 million; Todd Field’s T ar (USA, 2022) brought in $5.3 million against its $35 million cost; and Maria Schrader’s She Said (USA, 2022) earned $5.3 million against its $55 million cost. Hard times indeed for movies with serious agendas (Barnes 2022). Nor was 2022 a banner year for cinematic excellence. Numerous filmmakers with established careers and lofty reputations offered pictures that were lackluster in this critic’s eyes; among them were Gray’s coming-of-age tale Armageddon Time, Schrader’s topical She Said, Steven Spielberg’s family drama The Fabelmans (USA, 2022), Claire Denis’s romantic melodrama Stars at Noon (France/Panama/USA, 2022), Luca Guadagnino’s horror opus Bones and All (Italy/USA, 2022), Alejandro G. I~ n arritu’s sweeping but shallow Bardo: False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths (Bardo, falsa cr onica de unas cuantas verdades, Mexico, 2022), Ruben € Ostlund’s overcooked Triangle of Sadness (Sweden/France/UK/Germany/Turkey/Greece, 2022), David Cronenberg’s science-fictional Crimes of the Future (Canada/France/Greece/UK, 2022), Robert Eggers’s action yarn The Northman (USA, 2022), and Kenneth Branagh’s adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel Death on the Nile (UK/USA, 2022).

There is a subset of stage II pts with defined clinicopathologic features associated with poor prognosis who may benefit from ACT, although more discriminating and objective predictors of benefit are needed. In addition, there may be a subset of Stage III CC pts who could tolerate a de-escalation of ACT or who may require intensification of ACT to improve clinical outcome. Detectable ctDNA after resection of early-stage solid tumors has been associated with very high risk of recurrence, suggesting ctDNA is evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD). Several studies are ongoing to investigate the role of ctDNA in the optimal management of pts with CC using different assay technologies. Methods: This is a prospective, observational, multicenter study in the United States and Canada of 750 pts who have undergone complete surgical resection for stage II or III CC, have FFPE tissue available from the primary resection sufficient for a novel bespoke MRD assay, and are willing to provide serial whole blood specimens for ctDNA analysis. Subjects are asked to provide study specimens at baseline, pre-recurrence follow-up, and clinical recurrence (if applicable) study visits. ctDNA will be analyzed with an NGS-based MRD assay that identifies somatic genetic alterations from DNA derived from the pt’s tumor tissue, subtracts germline variants, and detects a subset of these tumor-specific (bespoke) ctDNA in the pt’s blood. The primary objective is to validate the association of post-definitive therapy and pre-recurrence follow-up ctDNA positivity with recurrence-free interval (RFI). Further objectives are to assess the: sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA positivity for subsequent clinical recurrence; contribution of post-surgery baseline, post-adjuvant therapy, and pre-recurrence follow-up ctDNA results on RFI; time from positive ctDNA to clinical recurrence in subjects who had a positive ctDNA result; and compare the Oncotype Colon Recurrence Score estimate of 3 yr recurrence risk with the observed 3 yr recurrence rate. The primary analysis will use a Cox proportional hazards regression applied to the RFI with ctDNA result (positive or negative) measured at post-surgical baseline (or end of ACT if ACT was used) and serially after that as a single, time-dependent covariate.

"Subgroup analysis in RE-MIND2, an observational, retrospective cohort study of tafasitamab plus lenalidomide versus systemic therapies in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL).","7560 Background: Tafasitamab (tafa) + lenalidomide (LEN) demonstrated efficacy in adult patients (pts) with R/R DLBCL ineligible for autologous stem-cell transplant in the pivotal Phase II study L-MIND (NCT02399085) and received accelerated approval in the United States in 2020 and conditional marketing authorization in Europe and Canada in 2021 in this setting. RE-MIND2 (NCT04697160), an observational, retrospective cohort study, compared pt outcomes from L-MIND with matched pt cohorts treated with other NCCN/ESMO recommended therapies. Methods: Methodology for RE-MIND2 has been presented previously. Hypothesis-generating analyses were conducted for pt subgroups of number of extranodal sites (ENS) (0–1 vs ≥2) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (yes vs no) in matched cohorts of pts receiving tafa + LEN vs systemic therapies pooled (STP), polatuzumab vedotin + bendamustine + rituximab (pola-BR), rituximab + LEN (R2), and CD19 CAR-T therapies (CAR-T). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results: Of 3,454 pts enrolled, 961, 106, 106, and 149 were treated with STP, pola-BR, R2, and CAR-T, resulting in 76, 24, 33, and 37 matched pairs for pts receiving tafa + LEN, respectively. Hazard ratios (HR) for OS show a trend toward favoring tafa + LEN in most pt subgroups (Table). Conclusion: These analyses suggest that tafa + LEN may be associated with improved OS vs selected systemic therapies for certain pts with high-risk disease and may further inform physicians’ treatment choices for pts with R/R DLBCL. These analyses are not powered for statistical comparison; small sample sizes in some subgroups result in wide confidence intervals (CI) and so results must be interpreted with caution.

Modeling the Global Dynamic Contagion of COVID-19,"The COVID-19 infections have profoundly and negatively impacted the whole world. Hence, we have modeled the dynamic spread of global COVID-19 infections with the connectedness approach based on the TVP-VAR model, using the data of confirmed COVID-19 cases during the period of March 23rd, 2020 to September 10th, 2021 in 18 countries. The results imply that, (i) the United States, the United Kingdom and Indonesia are global epidemic centers, among which the United States has the highest degree of the contagion of the COVID-19 infections, which is stable. South Korea, France and Italy are the main receiver of the contagion of the COVID-19 infections, and South Korea has been the most severely affected by the overseas epidemic; (ii) there is a negative correlation between the timeliness, effectiveness and mandatory nature of government policies and the risk of the associated countries COVID-19 epidemic affecting, as well as the magnitude of the net contagion of domestic COVID-19; (iii) the severity of domestic COVID-19 epidemics in the United States and Canada, Canada and Mexico, Indonesia and Canada is almost equivalent, especially for the United States, Canada and Mexico, whose domestic epidemics are with the same tendency; (iv) the COVID-19 epidemic has spread though not only the central divergence manner and chain mode of transmission, but also the way of feedback loop. Thus, more efforts should be made by the governments to enhance the pertinence and compulsion of their epidemic prevention policies and establish a systematic and efficient risk assessment mechanism for public health emergencies.",2022,12,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c48f8fc1f9d81b998adcfe893bec3d4bd44ce21e,c48f8fc1f9d81b998adcfe893bec3d4bd44ce21e,"[{'authorId': '1382337729', 'name': 'L.

Snow detection in alpine regions with Convolutional Neural Networks: discriminating snow from cold clouds and water body,"ABSTRACT Accurately monitoring the variation of snow cover from remote sensing is vital since it assists in various fields including prediction of floods, control of runoff values, and the ice regime of rivers. Spectral indices methods are traditional ways to realize snow segmentation, including the most common one – the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), which utilizes the combination of green and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands. In addition, spectral indices methods heavily depend on the optimal threshold to determine the accuracy, making it time-consuming to find optimal values for different places. Convolutional neural networks ensemble model with DeepLabV3+ was employed as sub-models for snow segmentation using (Sentinel-2), which aims to distinguish clouds and water body from snow. The imagery dataset generated in this article contains sites in global alpine regions such as Tibetan Plateau in China, the Alps in Switzerland, Alaska in the United States, Southern Patagonian Icefield in Chile, Tsylos Provincial Park, Tatsamenie Peak, and Dalton Peak in Canada. To overcome the limitation of DeepLabV3+, which only accepts three channels as input features, and the need to use six features: green, red, blue, near-infraRed, SWIR, and NDSI, 20 three-channel DeepLabV3+ sub-models, were constructed with different combinations of three features and then ensembled together. The proposed ensemble model showed superior performance than benchmark spectral indices method, with mIoU values ranging from 0.8075 to 0.9538 in different test sites. The results of this project contribute to the development of automated snow segmentation tools to assist earth observation applications.",2022,8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1984c2f86d5bb104dba7e1c409b882899a9fd025,1984c2f86d5bb104dba7e1c409b882899a9fd025,"[{'authorId': '2156141225', 'name': 'Yichen Lu'}, {'authorId': '145476926', 'name': 'T.

Google Trend and Massview Analysis of Internet Search Patterns of COVID-19 Symptoms.,"The corona-virus (COVID-19) has ravaged the entire world and the mass population is highly susceptible to the ferocious impacts of the mutated version of this pandemic (Nawaz et al. 2021). Over the last couple of weeks, the sharp pangs of this global epidemic have been enormously creeping across the United States, Brazil, India and has been excessively inflicting a state of fear, distress, anxiety, and seclusion among the individuals, employees, and organizations (Gautam & Sharma 2020, Sharma et al. 2020, Hamouche 2021, Ayaz & Dincer 2021). As per the WHO and government advisories, fatigue, nausea, sneezing, loss-of-taste, loss-of-smell, and chest pain are some of the moderate and critical indications of COVID19 (Klopfenstein et al. 2020). In 2020, a significant number of internet searches have been made for a wide range of COVID19 related terms viz. cough, cold, fever, loss of smell, loss-of-taste, mental-health, stress, anxiety, hand-wash, sanitization, coronavirus, mask, pandemic, epidemic etc. The main contribution of this work is to highlight the rate of internet activities (searches) of five major symptoms and other key terms (COVID19 vaccine, pandemic, testing, fever, cold, chloroquine, misinformation regarding COVID19, the impact of COVID19 on education, environment, and tourism) of this pandemic. The extensive analysis of this study is carried out using Google trend (https://trends.google.com/trends/) and mass view analysis (https://pageviews.toolforge.org/massviews/) tools. The cumulative, average and standard deviation of the internet activities for different terms (cough, cold, fever, loss of smell and taste) for ten major countries i.e. United States, Brazil, India, Russia, Spain, Mexico, United Kingdom, Canada, Italy and Saudi Arabia have also been computed. Different hypotheses have been designed to understand the relationship in the internet activities related to the cough, cold, fever, loss-of-smell and loss-of-taste of top three COVID-19 infected countries viz. United States, Brazil and India. The hypotheses for the same have been mentioned below: Hypothesis 1: Do the internet activities related to the search of the key term ‘Fever’ of American and Brazilian users differ during the pandemic period.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c237c6534695d121c561481f10a4d90ef581e089,c237c6534695d121c561481f10a4d90ef581e089,"[{'authorId': '144313657', 'name': 'Manik Sharma'}]"
"Racial, Ethnic, and Nativity Disparities in Physical Activity and Sedentary Time among Cancer Prevention Study-3 Participants","ABSTRACT Purpose Understanding racial/ethnic and nativity disparities in physical activity (PA) is important, as certain subgroups bear a disproportionate burden of physical inactivity–related diseases. This descriptive study compared mean leisure-time moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (LTMVPA) by race/ethnicity and nativity. Methods The Cancer Prevention Study-3 (78.1% women; age, 47.9 ± 9.7 yr) includes 4722 (1.9%) Asian/Pacific Islander; 1232 (0.5%) Black/Indigenous (non-White) Latino; 16,041 (6.5%) White Latino; 9295 (3.8%) non-Latino Black; 2623 (1.1%) Indigenous American; and 210,504 (85.7%) non-Latino White participants across the United States and Puerto Rico. Participants completed validated LTMVPA and 24-h time use surveys at enrollment (2006–2013). Differences in LTMVPA across race/ethnicity and nativity were examined by ANCOVA with paired Tukey tests adjusting for age and sex. The proportion of time spent sitting, sleeping, and on PA by race/ethnicity was also compared. Results There were significant differences in LTMVPA by race/ethnicity (race main effect, P < 0.001; nativity, P = 0.072; interaction, P < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons showed that White participants born abroad were the most active (23.8 MET-h·wk−1) and non-White Latino participants born abroad were the least active (17.9 MET-h·wk−1). Among Latinos, participants born in Puerto Rico were 6.6–7.3 MET-h·wk−1 less active than participants born in Mexico, the United States/Canada, or other countries. There were variations in time use by race/ethnicity, with the largest difference in time spent sitting while watching TV.

Strategic Trade and Investments Framework and Geopolitical Linkages across Asia-Pacific Economies,"The announced trade deal, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), is a loosely-structured economic bloc advocated by the current US administration, which will include 13 countries. These countries, in addition to the United States, will be Australia, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam. The bloc represents an estimated 40% of the global economy. In addition to its membership, IPEF could create global standards for AsiaPacific economies and beyond. This, according to US pronouncements, could bring faster economic growth across Asia-Pacific economies. Currently, the US GDP growth rate for 2022 is expected to be 2.8%, while that of China will be 2%. The position of the United States is that of strength and represents a shift away from the unfounded notion that China would be there to overtake the United States. The United States will continue to be the leading economy, and China will continue to be the second-largest economy. Nevertheless, there are certain advantages to the IPEF. The framework will help lower the cost of supply chains and reduce costly disruptions and could ensure a higher level of economic competitiveness during the next century for the whole region. Cooperation and economic and political stability and prosperity will also be enhanced. The framework was intended to be a replacement to the prior Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was advocated by former President Obama and current President Biden, and which former President Trump dropped out of in 2017. The pillars of the framework will focus on harmonizing corporate supply chains, expanding digital trade and clean energy, and fighting corruption. Critics of the IPEF’s loosely coupled framework suggest that this enlarged alliance is intended to reduce the regional influence of China, and some of the member states indicate that it should go beyond challenging China’s influence and should produce a functional economic bloc that will enhance and improve the positions of all the participant economies. Seven countries from the earlier TPP will belong in the IPEF; however, countries such as Canada and Mexico did not join as they are already in a free trade area with the United States. Moreover, US labor and environmental groups, which lobbied against the earlier TPP, are equally concerned about the IPEF, when it comes to digital JOURNAL OF ASIA-PACIFIC BUSINESS 2022, VOL. 23, NO. 3, 183–186 https://doi.org/10.1080/10599231.2022.2095584",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4e9350a7ae729868c397c387b7594ec809a42866,4e9350a7ae729868c397c387b7594ec809a42866,"[{'authorId': '97822554', 'name': 'R.

Is Gait Dysfunction a Prominent Sign of Isolated Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder?,"We thank Hobson and del Bigio for their interest in our study. We find their observation on beekeepers developing parkinsonism after repetitive exposure to cyanide dust (used to kill bee colonies in Canada to avoid wintering) interesting and worth further exploration for possible causation. In Slovenia, cyanide solutions have never been used in beekeeping. Beekeepers in Slovenia have always practiced a more traditional approach, with uninterrupted wintering. In fact, bee colonies are killed only exceptionally and if so, to treat severe disease. For this purpose, sulfur strips are used. We can, therefore, exclude the possibility of cyanide-related risk for PD in our study. Being aware of the increased risk for PD with pesticides use, we have considered exposure of beekeepers to other possibly toxic agents. For chemical protection of bee colonies against varroa, a parasitic mite that attacks bees, Slovenian beekeepers use different preparations of formic acid or oxalate acid, in a strictly regulated manner. Both acids are put in a hive, where they evaporate in very low dosages (around 15 mL per day of 60% formic acid and 0.05–0.1 g of oxalate acid per day) for 10 days. Such a low dosages kills only the parasite, without harming the bees. Use of this particular agents also allows the vast majority of Slovenian honey to be ecologically certified. Formic acid has a low toxicity and is regularly used as food additive/preservative and as pH adjuster in cosmetics (United States Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approved dosage for ingestion is up to 3 mg/kg/day). Although parkinsonism is a known consequence of intoxication with methanol, which is metabolized to formaldehyde and formic acid in the body, there have been no reports of parkinsonism following formic acid ingestion or topical exposure. Oxalic acid also has low toxicity and is commonly used as a reducing agent in rubber industry, photography, and bleaching. It is estimated that there is even a normal dietary intake of oxalic acid, as high as 5–500 mg daily, sometimes exceeding 1 g/day. For oxalate acid, acute dermal toxicity is reported with dosages of around 100 times higher than the amount used in beekeeping. Although there are rare reports of parkinsonism after ingestion of ethyleneglycol, which metabolizes to glycolic acid and oxalic acid, parkinsonism in topical or ingestion intoxication with oxalic acid was never reported. Therefore, it is unlikely that use of these pesticides in beekeeping would have any harmful effect. Finally, our results of higher (than expected) prevalence of PD among Slovenian beekeepers should not be taken as an unquestionable indication of higher risk for developing PD. Indeed, we have suggested that it may rather result from the response bias, because participants diagnosed with a particular disease will be more motivated to participate in a survey related to their disease. It is also known that PD patients have higher response rates to postal surveys compared to the general population. We conclude that chronic regular exposure to bee venom does not reduce the hazard for developing PD arising from genetic and environmental risk factors.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3aa4f6fe95b6980ac331b68988019ee2c529500a,3aa4f6fe95b6980ac331b68988019ee2c529500a,"[{'authorId': '1914566031', 'name': 'Slávka Neťuková'}, {'authorId': '102936239', 'name': 'J.

"Vaccination, Testing, Infection, and Death: How Optimum COVID-19 Control Improved GDP Growth in Countries Worldwide","Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus pandemic on March 11, 2020. The countries with the most reported COVID-19 cases through August 2022 were the United States, India, France, Brazil, and Germany. We aimed to evaluate pandemic control and economic growth at the global level for 159 countries and territories. Methods: We did a cross-sectional observational analysis using official COVID-19 epidemiological data between December 31, 2019, and August 10, 2021, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2020. We conducted descriptive analyses for the variables of interest. Our monitoring over time considered smoothed infection and death data. We corrected data to avoid biases indicated by WHO and created a statistical model of the proportion of vaccinated people and positive test ratio. We developed a statistical model to determine infection risk indicator (IRI), death risk indicator (DRI), and infectious disease control index (IDCI). We normalized IDCI using logarithmic transformation, applied linear regression, and correlated IDCI with GDP growth rate. Findings: There is a correlation between IDCI and GDP growth in 2020 (0·61), especially in the group with high GDP per capita (0·77). In 2020, countries with the highest control and economic growth were China (454, 2·3), Ethiopia (211, 6·1), Bangladesh (45, 3·8), and Egypt (39, 3·6), but in the inverse way: Brazil (1·30, –4·1), Mexico (1·36, –8·2), United States (2, –3·5), Russia (10·7, –3·1), and India (23, –8). Until August 10, 2021, Brazil, Mexico, the United States, and Russia had the lowest COVID-19 control (0·2, 0·3, 0·86, 2) among large population countries, highest infection risk (0·3, 0·07, 0·1, 0·04), and high death risk (14·58, 44, 11·5, 11·77), respectively. Interpretation: Different testing and vaccination capacities and population size influenced COVID-19 control. Countries that best managed epidemiological control also performed better in GDP growth.

Bootlegged Aliens: Immigration Politics on America’s Northern Border by Ashley Johnson Bavery (review),"Policing against unlawful border crossing, prejudiced association between foreigners and crime, and the stigmatization of immigrants as welfare cheaters— these are familiar subjects for historians of U.S. immigration, especially those specializing in immigration law and policy. Ashley Johnson Bavery’s Bootlegged Aliens, however, provides novel perspectives on these topics by analyzing the public perceptions of European immigrants and their relations with immigration laws, labor practices, and welfare policies in the Detroit-Windsor borderland between the 1920s and the 1930s. By so doing the book makes vital contributions not only to U.S. immigration historiography but also to the public debate over immigration in the United States today. This book’s major contribution lies in integrating the U.S. North and European immigrants into the history of American border control. While historians often focus on the Southwest as the main site of American border control, Bavery examines the development of discourse on immigrants, policing and raids, and immigration law enforcement in U.S.-Canada borderlands. Challenging the field’s predominant attention to the southern borders and Mexican migrants, some historians such as Kornel Chang and Beth LewWilliams have examined border control and private violence against Asian migrants in the Pacific Northwest. Bavery’s book enriches our understanding of northern border control by demonstrating that the Great Lakes region was an equally important ground of law enforcement and that Europeans were the main targets of policing and incarceration, deportation, and stigmatization as criminals in the region during the interwar period. Bavery also reveals that the labor exploitation and marginalization in Detroit of certain European immigrants deemed undesirable and suspicious, especially those from southern and eastern Europe, set precedents for later federal policies for noncitizens and undocumented immigrants. Furthermore, by uncovering how those Europeans suffered exclusion from New Deal welfare programs, Bavery revises the conventional understanding that the New Deal accelerated the integration of European immigrants into American society. Without overlooking their racial privileges over African Americans and immigrants of color in the social and economic milieu of Detroit, Bavery illuminates parallels in the experience of European and",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b98f847c338a285276a031bcd73af4a44b8a47d,2b98f847c338a285276a031bcd73af4a44b8a47d,"[{'authorId': '104498202', 'name': 'Hidetaka Hirota'}]"
A Window Into Mental Health: Developing and Pilot-Testing a Mental Health Promotion Intervention for Mexican Immigrants Through the Ventanilla de Salud Program,"Background Mexican immigrants in the United States face mental health challenges, disparities, and limited access to healthcare; however, mental health promotion efforts specifically targeting this population have been insufficient. The objective of this study was to develop and test a mental health promotion intervention based on protective mental health factors and coping strategies for Mexican immigrants recruited through a free, consulate-based program in Atlanta. Material and Methods Working with the Ventanilla de Salud program, we conducted a longitudinal study in three phases: formative research and design, pre-intervention assessment and post-implementation evaluation. The intervention was designed based on the health promotion model and interviews with stakeholders. Qualitative information was collected by semi-structured interviews with participants before and after the intervention. Quantitative outcomes were knowledge about protective factors and coping mechanisms, and psychosocial distress. Differences were assessed using the Wilcoxon non-parametrical test. Intent-to-treat analysis was conducted with all participants who signed the informed consent (carrying last observation forward), and a complete case analysis was conducted with those who attended at least 70% of the sessions and completed the post- implementation evaluation. Results Twenty-five participants were enrolled in the intervention. Mean age was 38 years, and the majority were women. Only nine participants attended at least 70% of the sessions and completed the final evaluation. Men, those who did not complete high school, and workers in service or construction jobs were more likely to drop out. Knowledge about protective factors [pre- vs. post-intervention median (inter-quartile range) = 111 (100, 120) vs. 115 (100, 124)] and coping mechanisms [96 (85, 104) vs. 99 (90, 110)], as well as psychosocial distress [3 (2, 3) vs. 2 (2, 3)] improved after the intervention in both intent-to treat and complete case analyses (p < 0.05). Qualitative results also support improvements in targeted protective factors. Discussion The intervention was successful in improving psychological distress among Mexican immigrants. These results support the implementation of evidence-based mental health promotion interventions among Mexican immigrants via free and familiar programs.

17 th Annual Wildland Resources Department Graduate Research Symposium,"M.M. student. The western United States is currently witnessing rapidly shifting fire regimes, and wildfire activity is projected to continue to change into the future. Increases in annual area burned and increases in area burned at high severity represent threats for some species and opportunities for other species, including some plants and wildlife. My research will focus on how wildfires in Utah alter animal space use and behavior in the years following fire. I intend to study the complex interactions between wildlife habitat selection, herbivory, space-use, and post-fire vegetation regrowth in two ways. First, I will examine changes in the time elk spend foraging within burned habitats, in comparison to the time spent foraging in those same habitats before they were burned. To do this, I will use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which assign behavioral states (e.g., ‘foraging’ or ‘resting’) based on positional data. I will use data obtained from GPS locations of collared elk ( Cervus canadensis ) collected by the Utah Department of Wildlife Resources. Second, I will investigate whether recent fire severity moderates the influence of vegetation biomass alone in attracting elk to a site. To do this, I will place camera traps and conduct vegetation sampling at 40 field sites in the Spanish Fork canyon, stratified by fire severity (unburned, low, moderate, and high severity). I will use these data to calculate elk density and biomass during three time periods (early, middle, and late summer) over two growing seasons. I plan to provide insights on elk space-use in wildfire-burned areas, and I expect to learn that elk are an example of a species that will benefit from increasing fire activity. In an era of climate change and changing fire regimes, understanding the lingering impacts of wildfire will help wildlife and land managers plan for the future. (HILF) rest and deferred rotational grazing system. The DLL has also completed small scale sagebrush treatments across their lower elevation pastures. My study also includes the Three Creeks Allotment (3C), which consists of 146,000 hectares and is a consolidation of 29 individual BLM, USFS, and private grazing allotments. Historically, the 3C has primarily been following a traditional season-long grazing system where livestock continually graze the landscape with minimal pasture rotations (i.e. season-long grazing). We hypothesize that sagebrush rangelands managed using site-specific and adaptive rotational grazing practices can facilitate grass and forb production, creating a “green wave,” or vegetation regrowth, effect that can benefit sage-grouse by increasing nesting and brood success. My three research questions are: 1. How do sage-grouse vital rates and brood success differ under different grazing management practices over the 11-year study period, 2. Can nest success be determined for sage-grouse using statistical analysis of Platform Transmitter Terminal marked female sage-grouse movements, and 3. Can the Normalized Density Vegetation Index data be used to monitor changes in vegetation production and utilization that may result from livestock grazing? areas, and balance costs against projected population success – while thinking forward to future conditions. Adelges hereafter BWA, is an invasive forest pest that attacks and kills true firs ( Abies spp. ) in North America. Within Utah, it was first detected has Nutt. Relative to other true firs, subalpine fir has exhibited more susceptibility to BWA-related damage, and mortality rates among individuals at infested sites may reach over 80% in as little as three years. However, the specific drivers of stand-to-stand variation in observed damage are poorly understood. Subalpine fir is a key component of the high-elevation forests of the Interior West, and die-off in fir populations contributes to increased erosion, loss of forage and habitat for wildlife, and declines in watershed quality and forest resiliency. I am seeking to explore how forest characteristics may influence the severity of BWA-related damage. Infested stands of subalpine fir in Utah and Idaho will be identified and visited for the collection of forest assessment data (tree size, species composition and density, etc.) as well as the observation of metrics specific to describing the negative impact of BWA on individual trees. These data will form the basis of a severity rating system to characterize and assess BWA-related damage within stands and guide treatment decisions within the Interior West. Additionally, collected data will be used in the development of a mixed-effect model to evaluate the relationship between tree and stand-level characteristics, climatic factors, and increased damage due to BWA infestation. to help prioritize soil organisms that are most likely to increase or decrease target plant growth. Sixteen plant species were grown in a common garden for four years. For each plant in each of the four years of the experiment, bulk soil DNA was extracted and sequenced on an Illumina platform to characterize the associated archaea, bacteria, and fungi. Rhizosphere soil was included in the sampling in the final year of the study. I will correlate plant growth with the dominant soil organisms associated with each plant. Soil organisms that are strongly negatively correlated with the biomass of a plant species are likely plant pathogens while soil organisms that are strongly positively correlated with plant growth are likely plant growth-promoting soil microbes. Results will identify putative plant-growth-promoting and suppressing microbial species. This is a first critical step toward developing plant growth-promoting or suppressing soil organisms that could be used to increase crop productivity, suppress weed growth or maintain species diversity. herbivory protection. We will conduct experimental aspen planting across three fire footprints in the Colorado Plateau. Planting locations will be selected based on the presence of naturally occurring biological legacies to emulate severity at a fine scale, where a snag will represent high severity and a live tree will represent low severity. All the seedlings will be arranged in each cardinal direction around a shading structure and half will be protected from herbivory. This approach will allow us to investigate the influence of fire severity of individual seedlings and also will provide practical guidance about biological legacies that are beneficial for revegetation. Understanding how burn severity affects planted aspen seedling survival is important for managers concerned with type conversion following a wildfire. This research will also improve our understanding of microsite conditions conducive for the survival and growth of aspen seedlings, an important and understudied component of western forests. in a changing climate: Using a heritage cattle breed to maintain Recent and long-term climatic trends show that the Colorado Plateau, USA is experiencing more frequent and extended periods of drought and heat, reducing the quality and quantity of available forage in the rangelands that dominate this region. These climatic changes raise two important questions for livestock producers: a) how to feed cattle under decreased forage production and b) how to maintain range condition under livestock grazing. With this study we propose Criollo cattle, a heritage breed adapted to the arid rangelands of Mexico, as an alternative to conventional breeds such as Red Angus, for maintaining ecosystem function under livestock production. Criollo cows are 300-500 lbs lighter than Red Angus cows, and previous studies in the Chihuahuan Desert have shown that they range farther from water, eat a broader diet containing more shrubs, and navigate more rugged terrain than conventional breeds. We will determine if these behaviors also occur on the Colorado Plateau at the Dugout Ranch, located in San Juan County, UT, and we hypothesize that these behaviors will effectively increase the quantity and quality of forage available to Criollo (vs. Red Angus) and lessen any negative impacts on range condition. We will track the movement of 20 Red Angus and 20 Criollo cow-calf pairs using GPS collars and pedometers. We will examine their diet composition through fecal DNA metabarcoding which, when coupled with field and remotely sensed data on community cover and composition, will allow us to determine diet selectivity and landscape-level forage availability. In addition, we will examine their impact on ecosystem services such as erosion susceptibility and biological soil crust cover. Finally, we will use beef production metrics such as body condition scores and pounds calf crop weaned to quantify the economic feasibility of producing Criollo vs. Red Angus cattle on the Colorado Plateau. wolves recover and expand their range, wildlife managers depend on approaches that determine and diffuse conflicts where wolves exist or are likely to establish packs in the future. My study will 1) develop predictive spatial models of depredation risk; 2) investigate how wolf pack composition and rendezvous site proximity to livestock factor in cases of chronic depredation; 3) develop a spatial distribution model to predict future wolf pack establishment where the species is absent but likely soon to inhabit; and 4) assess the efficacy of a novel non-lethal tool to reduce depredation. This research will improve conflict-related management of wolves as the species navigates an anthropocentric landscape. we analyzed soil samples from each mesocosm for inorganic nitrogen, enzyme activity, and microbial biomass.

POLITIK PERDAGANGAN NEGARA-NEGARA AMERIKA UTARA DI TENGAH PESIMISME NAFTA,"Abstract President Trump has insisted on reforming NAFTA on the assumption that this agreement does not benefit America. US citizens have lost jobs, potential environmental damage, and large investments in Meksiko limit the possibility of claiming higher wages for low-income workers in the US. Meanwhile, the wage gap for unskilled workers in Meksiko has also increased in proportion to technological advances resulting from the rapid flow of foreign investment in industry. Increased industrialization has contributed significantly to the conversion of agricultural land and the loss of jobs for traditional farmers in Meksiko. The poverty rate in Meksiko in 2014 was higher than the poverty rate in 1994, causing a trend of Mexican immigration to the United States. Based on trade politics theory, this paper aims to examine the positive and negative implications of implementing the free trade agreement and explain the trade politics of member countries to remain committed to North American trade regionalism. The research found that Meksiko benefited from US and Canadian investment in order to reduce unemployment and support the country's capacity as a production base in the region.

AbstrakPresiden Trump bersikeras mereformasi NAFTA dengan asumsi perjanjian ini tidak menguntungkan Amerika. Warga AS telah kehilangan lapangan kerja, potensi kerusakan lingkungan, dan investasi besar di Meksiko membatasi kemungkinan klaim upah yang lebih tinggi untuk pekerja berpenghasilan rendah di AS. Sementara, kesenjangan upah pada tenaga tidak terampil di Meksiko turut meningkat sebanding dengan kemajuan teknologi yang dihasilkan dari derasnya arus investasi asing di bidang industri. Meningkatnya industrialisasi berkontribusi signifikan terhadap alih fungsi lahan pertanian dan hilangnya pekerjaan petani tradisional di Meksiko. Tingkat kemiskinan Meksiko pada tahun 2014 lebih tinggi dari tingkat kemiskinan tahun 1994 sehingga menyebabkan tren imigrasi Meksiko ke Amerika Serikat. Berdasarkan teori politik perdagangan, tulisan ini bertujuan untuk menelaah implikasi positif dan negatif implementasi kesepakatan perdagangan bebas dan menjelaskan politik perdagangan negara-negara anggota untuk tetap berkomitmen pada regionalisme perdagangan Amerika Utara. Hasil penelitian menemukan bahwa Meksiko diuntungkan dari investasi AS dan Kanada dalam rangka mengurangi pengangguran dan mendukung kapasitas negara sebagai basis produksi di kawasan. Kanada menjadi pemasok utama untuk produk teknologi informasi dan komunikasi ke Amerika, sementara AS mempertahankan posisinya sebagai pemain tunggal dalam sektor otomotif.

Reply to: “Neither Friend Nor Foe: Beekeeping and Parkinson's Disease”,"We thank Hobson and del Bigio for their interest in our study. We find their observation on beekeepers developing parkinsonism after repetitive exposure to cyanide dust (used to kill bee colonies in Canada to avoid wintering) interesting and worth further exploration for possible causation. In Slovenia, cyanide solutions have never been used in beekeeping. Beekeepers in Slovenia have always practiced a more traditional approach, with uninterrupted wintering. In fact, bee colonies are killed only exceptionally and if so, to treat severe disease. For this purpose, sulfur strips are used. We can, therefore, exclude the possibility of cyanide-related risk for PD in our study. Being aware of the increased risk for PD with pesticides use, we have considered exposure of beekeepers to other possibly toxic agents. For chemical protection of bee colonies against varroa, a parasitic mite that attacks bees, Slovenian beekeepers use different preparations of formic acid or oxalate acid, in a strictly regulated manner. Both acids are put in a hive, where they evaporate in very low dosages (around 15 mL per day of 60% formic acid and 0.05–0.1 g of oxalate acid per day) for 10 days. Such a low dosages kills only the parasite, without harming the bees. Use of this particular agents also allows the vast majority of Slovenian honey to be ecologically certified. Formic acid has a low toxicity and is regularly used as food additive/preservative and as pH adjuster in cosmetics (United States Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approved dosage for ingestion is up to 3 mg/kg/day). Although parkinsonism is a known consequence of intoxication with methanol, which is metabolized to formaldehyde and formic acid in the body, there have been no reports of parkinsonism following formic acid ingestion or topical exposure. Oxalic acid also has low toxicity and is commonly used as a reducing agent in rubber industry, photography, and bleaching. It is estimated that there is even a normal dietary intake of oxalic acid, as high as 5–500 mg daily, sometimes exceeding 1 g/day. For oxalate acid, acute dermal toxicity is reported with dosages of around 100 times higher than the amount used in beekeeping. Although there are rare reports of parkinsonism after ingestion of ethyleneglycol, which metabolizes to glycolic acid and oxalic acid, parkinsonism in topical or ingestion intoxication with oxalic acid was never reported. Therefore, it is unlikely that use of these pesticides in beekeeping would have any harmful effect. Finally, our results of higher (than expected) prevalence of PD among Slovenian beekeepers should not be taken as an unquestionable indication of higher risk for developing PD. Indeed, we have suggested that it may rather result from the response bias, because participants diagnosed with a particular disease will be more motivated to participate in a survey related to their disease. It is also known that PD patients have higher response rates to postal surveys compared to the general population. We conclude that chronic regular exposure to bee venom does not reduce the hazard for developing PD arising from genetic and environmental risk factors.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a7f418c0c18230d165f01571a76bdfb61a4f0a78,a7f418c0c18230d165f01571a76bdfb61a4f0a78,"[{'authorId': '82615183', 'name': 'Maja Klarendić'}, {'authorId': '6416681', 'name': 'M.

Bibliometric Analysis of Research of the Behavioral and Social Dimension of the Public Health System of the World,"Abstract The paper emphasizes the importance of human health as the most valuable, most important resource at the individual and national level, affecting the country’s socio-economic development and competitiveness. It states that it is necessary for the actors ensuring the public health system to form a new concept for the functioning of the health system, taking into account the current state of public health, the functioning of medical institutions, and the resource support of the healthcare industry. The primary purpose is to conduct a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications dealing with the global behavioral and social dimension of the public health system. The systematization of literary achievements and approaches to solving this problem has been carried out, which indicates the need for proper attention and high-quality, conceptual, international research by world scientists on issues related to the state and level of public health, satisfaction with the healthcare system. The relevance of the analysis of research on the behavioral and social dimension of the public health system of the world implies that the further development of the healthcare industry necessitates research, intensive development, and dissemination of available scientific and methodological international experience in solving this issue of the public health system in different countries worldwide. The research consisted of four stages. A map of the interrelationships of key concepts with other scientific categories has been constructed; a content-contextual study of the constructed blocks of bibliometric analysis has been implemented; an inter-cluster analysis has been carried out. A map of the interrelationships of the key concepts under study with other scientific categories has been constructed, reflecting the dynamics in the form of a contextual-time block; the evolutionary-time prospects of the study have been determined. A geographically extensive map of the scientific bibliography of the categories under study has been constructed; the spatial component of the study has been analyzed. A territorially branched map of the spatio-temporal dimension of the category under the study in dynamics has been constructed. The methodological tools of the research are theoretical (grouping, abstraction, synthesis) and empirical methods (observation, description), research methods, services of the Scopus information platform, and VOSViewers tools.1.6.15. The study was conducted based on the publications indexed by the Scopus database for 2000-2020. The objects of research were the following scientific categories: “health care system, medical services, behavioral aspect, social aspect,” the countries United States, Germany, Norway, Greece, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, India, Netherlands, China, Brazil, Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium, Iran, Japan, Italy, Spain, because these two groups of objects allowed to conduct two-directional analysis of the problem under study. The results of the bibliometric analysis presented in the paper showed that the aspect of the behavioral and social dimension of the public health system was relatively young and insufficiently developed; the attention of the scientific community for a long time on this issue was mainly concentrated in the United States and the United Kingdom. China, Iran, and Japan were less involved in this process at an earlier time interval, but this research became relevant for them in recent years. The study results can be used to identify the most potential priority areas for forming the policy and strategy of the state health system, based on determining the main significant, modern, relevant characteristics of the healthcare industry.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/960028c54353ae613e35665b286cdb871207a77f,960028c54353ae613e35665b286cdb871207a77f,"[{'authorId': '98329944', 'name': 'T.

Beekeeper Parkinsonism,"The observation by Klarendi c et al of an unexplained higher-than-expected prevalence of parkinsonism among Slovenian beekeepers is intriguing. We suggest the authors should explore the occupational use of cyanide as a potential explanation for the parkinsonism found. Known environmental contributors to Parkinson’s disease include an associationwith living in a farm environment and insecticide exposure. Now recognized is the variability of phenotypic expression of genetic and toxic-induced neurodegenerative illnesses based on age of exposure and genetic susceptibility factors. In the 1990s, we observed 6 cases of parkinsonian beekeepers, all with a history of exposure to cyanide dust repeatedly over an average of 23 years. We wondered about a causative link related to intermittent, annual use of calcium cyanide, but the observation was not compelling enough to warrant publication. Now having evidence that beekeepers are at greater risk of parkinsonism, an explanation should be sought. To our knowledge a relation between parkinsonism, intermittent cyanide exposure, and beekeeping has not previously been suggested in the literature. Cyanide is neurotoxic and is absorbed through skin and mucous membranes, ingested, or inhaled. It has an affinity for ferric iron in cytochrome oxidase enzymes within mitochondria; this is responsible for a cytotoxic effect resulting in the failure of cellular respiration. In animal models of chronic or repeated exposure to cyanide, the substantia nigra is more selectively involved than in acute toxicity. Beekeepers in northern United States and Canada have used calcium cyanide dust annually to kill bee colonies beginning in the 1920s to reduce costs of overwintering. Recommended protections include a respirator, boots and gloves, and full-length clothing. The use dropped off in Canada after 1986 because the U.S.–Canada border was closed to bee imports to avoid the introduction of bee mites into Canada. It was available in Canada until December 1997. In 2000, we conducted a survey of 45 beekeepers at the Canadian Province of Manitoba’s Beekeeper’s 94th Annual Convention. Thirty-three questionnaires were returned. Twenty-four of 33 beekeepers used cyanide dust, for an average of 12 years (range: 1–27 years). Three continued to use it, having stockpiled it before it was no longer available. Only one used a mask regularly. Ten recalled using gloves. (Table 1). The annual 4-H Beekeeping Manual from 2009 authored by Brian Rowe quoted the United States Department of Agriculture as stating in the USA “organic honey is quite rare to find because most beekeepers routinely use calcium cyanide to kill colonies before extracting the honey.” Most fumigants are now forbidden in beekeeping in Europe. We do not know to what degree cyanide has been used by Slovenian beekeepers, but it has been used widely in Europe in the past. We would suggest the authors explore, perhaps by a follow-up questionnaire, the frequency and duration of cyanide use in Slovenian beekeepers to explore evidence for a more definitive relation than we were able to derive from our small series of observed cases.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6b3ed2aece02a0eb3870be60c4579483415ff88d,6b3ed2aece02a0eb3870be60c4579483415ff88d,"[{'authorId': '49086036', 'name': 'D.

"A Failed Vision of Empire: The Collapse of Manifest Destiny, 1845–1872","the misalignment between the realities of American trade (and its reliance on opium) and American political rhetoric surrounding the First Opium War (1839–1842). This is powerful stuff and the best expression of Norwood’s idea of “political economy.” Minor errors like referring anachronistically to “Oregon Territory” instead of “the Oregon Country” distract slightly from an enjoyable and important chapter (p. 77). Given more space, Trading Freedommight have more fully unpacked some of its quips and reduced the risk of readers getting wrong impressions. The fleeting observation that diplomacy with China and the Sandwich Islands in 1842 formed “two expansions of US power in the Pacific in one,” for instance, begs for further explanation (p. 92). Had Americans shifted their view of China from “the Indies” to “the Pacific”? While the Chinese portion of Norwood’s source was in reaction to the British, the Hawaiian portion was a tepid response to a Hawaiian diplomatic mission seeking an affirmation of Hawaiian independence. At the same time, more space would allow for consideration of rival sea-to-sea visions like John Jacob Astor’s Astoria. The close timing of the Treaty of Wangxia in 1844 and the combination of the Oregon Treaty and the Mexican-American War in 1846–1848 seem like they should have caused a revolution, but not in Trading Freedom. Elsewhere, readers would benefit frommore elucidation instead of allusion. The “Propped-Open Door” in the title of Chapter Seven seems to be an allusion to John Hay’s “Open Door” policy, but why? Was the “irrepressible conflict” that Frederick Low suggested was coming between China and the West in the 1870s meant to be an echo of William Seward’s antebellum “irrepressible conflict,” or is the repeated phrasing a coincidence? The larger idea of the final three chapters, that the political-economic relationship between China and the United States changed in the later decades of the nineteenth century, is convincing. One wishes it were more complete. The California gold rush probably looms too large in the established narrative of anti-Chinese sentiment leading to the Chinese Exclusion Act (it is a long time from 1849 to 1882, after all), but the narrative in Trading Freedom overcorrects to the point that the gold rush barely registers. It is refreshing to see a discussion of the “Coolie trade” focusing on agricultural labor in the South instead of railroad labor in the West, but surely there should be room to discuss both. The final observation that a political abstraction of a “China trade” of obtaining Chinese goods gave way to an idea of a “China market” of selling American goods in China is appealing. One wishes there were space in the book to explore more fully the shifts in economy underlying the changing political rhetoric.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/81688e6bd8ddb99242cae4781c409268e1391a3b,81688e6bd8ddb99242cae4781c409268e1391a3b,"[{'authorId': '2093344376', 'name': 'Michael Hill'}]"

We analyze the impact of avocado plantations on ecosystem drivers, such as soil moisture and vegetation primary productivity, and quantify trends between 2001 and 2018 using remote sensing and ​ in-situ ​ information for delineating avocado plantations. We observe negative trends in soil moisture (-0.038 [CI ​ 95% ​ -0.06, 0.01] m ​ -3 ​ m ​ -3 ​ d ​ −1 ​ ), but increasingly positive trends of vegetation productivity (105.4 [CI ​ 95% ​ 1.4, 203.8] g C m 2 d ​ −1 ​ ) that are associated with the industrialized avocado plantations. The analysis reveals that negative trends of soil moisture and positive trends of primary productivity are associated with low vegetation density and bare soil conditions (e.g., 2018) where avocado is produced.

Current soil moisture monitoring schemes via in situ station networks are sparsely distributed while remote sensing satellite soil moisture maps have a very coarse spatial resolution. In this study, an empirical surface soil moisture (SSM) model was established via fusion of in situ continental and regional scale soil moisture networks, remote sensing data (SMAP and Sentinel-1) and high-resolution land surface parameters (e.g., soil texture, terrain) using a quantile random forest (QRF) algorithm. The model had a spatial resolution of 100m and performed well under cultivated, herbaceous, forest, and shrub soils (overall R ​ 2 = 0.524, RMSE = 0.07 m ​ 3 m ​ −3 ​ ). It has a relatively good transferability at the regional scale among different soil moisture networks (mean RMSE = 0.08–0.10 m ​ 3 m ​ −3 ​ ). The global model was applied to map SSM dynamics at 30–100m across a field-scale soil moisture network (TERENO-Wüstebach) and an 80-ha cultivated cropland inWisconsin, USA.Without the use of local training data, the model was able to delineate the variations in SSM at the field scale but contained large bias. With the addition of 10% local training datasets (“spiking”), the bias of the model was significantly reduced. The QRF model was relatively insensitive to the resolution of Sentinel-1 data but was affected by the resolution and accuracy of soil maps.

For Colombia, the government for Colombia, the government through the Rural Agricultural Planning Unit (UPRA, Unidad de Planificación Rural Agropecuaria) is using the national scale farmland evaluation. Land evaluation is being used to plan for 20 years the climatic effects of potential areas of different productive systems. Land evaluation was used to plan the action of 20 years in the future, with the climatic effects in the potential areas of different productive systems. It is evaluated physically with the spatialization of the scenarios of climate change for RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 y RCP 8.0 and the variability historical climate for ENOS. As a result, a zoning of climatic effects is carried out at different levels to take action by 2040. The methodology is applied with a spatial approach, for the crops of dry rice, technified corn, potatoes and pastures. The greatest effects are seen for climatic variability in ENOS, with potential reductions of up to 20%. For the scenarios of climate change, the potential reductions of up to 10%.

Machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are commonly leveraged in DSM and are a data-driven approach to modelling; the resulting model is inextricably linked to the data being used to build the model. Likely the most used algorithm for sampling design is the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) approach, designed to optimize the sampling locations within feature space, ensuring adequate coverage of the environmental covariates from which the model will later be developed. Despite the advances in sample site selection, one critical component of a sampling design which has received considerably less attention is the optimal number of samples, and this question has yet to be adequately addressed in the literature. Few techniques have been proposed to address this gap. In this study, we evaluate the use of five techniques: normalized variance approach, the Kullbach-Liebler Divergence (D ​ kl ​ ), Kullbach-Leibler Divergence for continuous variables (D ​ klc ​ ), the Jenson-Shannon Divergence (D ​ js ​ ), and the Jensen-Shannon Distance (Dist ​ js ​ ) to determine an optimal sample size. We test these techniques for a 26-hectare study site near Guelph, Ontario, using an increasing number of environmental covariates (4, 6, 8, 10 and 12). For each combination of covariates, we used the cLHS to generate 400 unique sampling designs, including 10 replicates of sample plans at 40 different sampling intensities increasing from 10 to 400 in steps of 10. The techniques could be sensitive to data binning, a requirement for comparing the sample plan to the population, therefore the calculation of the divergence metrics was tested across a range of bin sizes from 15 bins to 50 bins in steps of 5. Across all techniques and bin sizes, the Dist ​ js consistently resulted in the largest sample size, while the D ​ klc resulted in the smallest sample size. The number of covariates used to create the sample plan had no effect on the optimal sample size, where sample size increased marginally as the number of covariates increased. For example, sample size determined using the Dist ​ js increased from 185 with four covariates to 189 with 12 covariates. On the other hand, the number of bins used to compute the metrics had a significant effect on sample size. For all techniques we saw a strong linear relationship between bins and sample size with regression slopes typically ranging between 2 and 3 sites per additional bin. For example, the sample size determined using Dist ​ js with four covariates increased from 183 using 15 bins to 278 using 50 bins. This comparison of different techniques to determine an optimal sample size provides some new tools that can be added to the DSM toolbox, but also reveals substantial challenges that remain for resolving the issue of optimal Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9 * Corresponding author email: ​ preston.sorenson@usask.ca Abstract. Conversion of arable cropland to forage crops has been proposed as a potential method to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks to sequester carbon and improve soil quality. In this study, intact soil cores were collected from long-term boreal forest soil research plots established in 1980 consisting of: a mixed arable crop and forage agroecological rotation (AE), continuous forage (CF), and continuous grain (CG) rotations. These cores were analyzed using a SisuROCK automated hyperspectral imaging system in a laboratory setting collecting shortwave infrared reflectance data. Samples were then analyzed for SOC and total nitrogen (TN) contents by dry combustion to prepare a training data set. Predictive models were successfully built for SOC and TN using a combination of wavelet analysis and Bayesian Regularized Neural Nets. The CF rotation was found to have the highest SOC and TN contents compared to AE rotation for only the top 3 and 4 cm, respectively. These two rotations had comparable contents for both parameters for the rest of the topsoil, which was greater than the SOC and TN contents in the CG rotation to depths of approximately 12 cm. Increases in both SOC and TN were associated with increased spatial aggregation at fine spatial scales.

Trial in progress: Phase II activity trial of high-dose radiation and chemosensitization in patients with macrometastatic lymph node spread after sentinel node biopsy in vulvar cancer: Groningen International Study on Sentinel Nodes in Vulvar Cancer III (GROINSS-V III/NRG-GY024).,"TPS5624 Background: Early stage invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva is treated by radical excision of the primary tumor combined with a sentinel node (SN) procedure for the groins. GROINSS-VI and GOG-173 demonstrated that if there is no metastasis to the SN, then standard of care is observation. GROINSS-VII/GOG-270 demonstrated that micrometastatic disease (<2mm) to the SN requires standard radiotherapy (50 Gy) without the need for an inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL). This study also found that patients with macrometastasis ( > 2mm) required IFL in order to have an acceptably low groin recurrence rate. However, IFL is associated with significant morbidity such as lymphedema, wound healing issues, and recurrent infections. It is hypothesized that for those with macrometastasis ( > 2 mm) in the SN, the efficacy of treatment can be increased by giving a higher dose of radiotherapy along with chemosensitization. Methods: This is an international multicenter single-arm phase II prospective clinical trial. The primary objective is to investigate the safety of replacing IFL by chemoradiation in early-stage vulvar cancer patients with a macrometastasis ( > 2mm) and/or extracapsular extension in the SN. The primary endpoint is the groin recurrence rate in the first two years after primary treatment. Secondary endpoints are short and long-term morbidity associated with the SN procedure and chemoradiation and quality of life as measured by EORTC-QLQc30. Patients with invasive ( > 1mm) squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, stage T1, tumor size < 4 cm diameter and no suspicious lymph nodes by imaging of the groins will proceed with SN detection. Institutions enrolling patients must demonstrate prior surgical experience with SN detection with the submission of at least 10 successfully completed cases in vulvar cancer. Patients with SN metastases > 2mm and/or with extracapsular extension or those with > 1 SN with micrometastases will be eligible for this study. Treatment will consist of chemoradiation with a dose of 56 Gy to the groin combined with weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, 15, 21 and 29 of radiotherapy.

Editorial: Advances in Ocean Bottom Seismology,"Among the physical sciences, seismology is relatively young; with the continued advances in instrumental technologies and computer capacity, ours has to be one of the most rapidly evolving subject areas within the Earth Sciences writ large. Exploration of the Earth by way of seismic observation and modeling is expanding not only in the range of capabilities from reservoir scale to whole-Earth sensing but in recent decades seismology has resolutely marched from the Earth’s continents and sea shores into the oceans, which cover nearly 75% of the Earth and have until recently hindered our ability to more fully explore the planet. The past few decades have brought about advances in design and deployment of ocean bottom seismic sensors and their data acquisition capacity, resulting in an exponential increase in seafloor seismic experiments driven by both pure scientific inquiry as well as economic development. With the increasing focus on what is arguably Earth’s last frontier for seismology, it is timely that we present some of the latest new results, observations, modeling and technological advances in ocean bottom seismology. Many traditional seismic techniques that have been used in special land-based deployments are also undertaken by marine seismologists. Their work is made more challenging by difficult deployment requirements and the long time gap between station installation and data retrieval. Hindering many fundamental analyses is the appreciable seismic noise environment on the ocean floor, inaccessibility of sensors for validation of precise location, attitude and orientation, coupling and response issues and possible errors or mishaps that cannot be addressed in near real time as they would on land. Nosov et al. present here an intriguing new approach to evaluate the impacts of these issues, however. Such difficulties have not daunted researchers, who have been able to gain unprecedented observations and new understanding of geodynamic processes in spreading centers, triple junctions and transform systems, such as Núñez-Cornú et al.’s TSUJAL passive experiment offshore Western Mexico and the active-source profiling near the Mexican Islas Marias combined with passive data (Madrigal et al.; Núñez et al.) to further explore tectonic structures and correlate the observations with detailed bathymmetry. Evaluation of seismic hazard and improved location capability for near-shore offshore events including potentially tsunamigenic earthquakes are historically difficult when observations are restricted to onshore networks, but a better picture of offshore seismicity for assessing hazards is demonstrated for an OBS experiment in the Ionian Sea by Sgroi et al. Innovative application, or adaptation, of new and specialized seismic methods are demonstrated with seafloor data, providing an exciting opportunity for insights and uses for these sometimes Edited and reviewed by: Carolina Lithgow-Bertelloni, University of California, Los Angeles, United States",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2fb6761afe3315b8bdd1adb675bb61b411ee6c10,2fb6761afe3315b8bdd1adb675bb61b411ee6c10,"[{'authorId': '14609026', 'name': 'C.

In the Name of Energy Sovereignty,"Throughout history, the phrase “In the name of the King” justified actions that trumped the rights of citizens in order to safeguard the interests of the Crown. Today, in the name of energy sovereignty, states deploy the government apparatus to access oil and gas in other parts of the world, build pipelines on private lands, subsidize renewable energy, and nationalize their oil and power industries. States justify each of these actions by noting that they create a sense of energy independence, ensure security, or achieve other social and economic goals. Energy, however, cannot be trapped in one “realm.” Its nature is to move across human-created jurisdictions and to settle, at least in the cases of oil and gas, in specific geological formations where extraction is not always economically feasible. Additionally, energy evolves with technological advancements and its production must adapt to new challenges, like those posed by the global climate crisis. Thus, an efficient and reliable energy sector that “secures” the state requires engagement with other foreign powers to regulate the trade and investment of energy and its sources. States, however, have created a web of often inconsistent treaties, reflecting competing and frequently contradictory energy policy goals. When disputes inevitably arise, arbitrators or committees must balance the parties’ competing energy goals. This Article introduces the concept of energy sovereignty as a novel analytical framework to explain the fragmentation and inconsistencies in international energy governance. By introducing archetypical energy sovereignties, this Article provides a framework through which interpreters of trade and investment agreements can balance the competing energy goals that are attached to the agreements. In doing so, this Article demonstrates how ignoring the complexities in the way states exercise their energy sovereignties can undermine integrated regional efforts to deal effectively with energy challenges like reducing carbon emissions or building a cost-effective and resilient energy ma© 2022, Guillermo J.

Health disparity is a global issue: Understanding Latin America,"Inequity in health care is a multifaceted complex global issue not unique to rare disease. Grouping countries into one unified entity is imperfect without a combined political‐strategic goal to improve health. Common disease treatment lacks this equity and patients with rare disease, inherent to the limited prevalence and cost of therapy suffer perhaps more so. Differences in wealth, access, medical expertise, and political views on the importance and governance of health care are each a component of the disparity. In 1986, members of the United Nations (UN) proclaimed the “Declaration on the Right to Development” and 30 years later these goals expanded with the establishment of the UN Right to Health and the UN Sustainable Development. The goals of “ensuring healthy lives promoting the well‐being for all at all ages” and of “leaving no one behind” deems that all people are entitled to equal quality of health. This is the goal for all physicians, to provide the best care possible and give their patients all the options available to improve their quality of life and ultimately survival. No country is immune to these facets, as seen and magnified unfortunately by the COVID‐19 pandemic. COVID‐19 may in fact delay its goal completion in 2030. As physician–scientists for rare diseases, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and chronic thromboembolic PH, here in the United States, many of the issues faced globally for rare disease exist. There is inequity of health care, access to care, access to medication, and wealth distribution in US geographic regions, states, cities, down to the community level. Although the US has one health system, insurance companies and states can limit access to advance medications and devices. This editorial is not aimed to tackle all these issues and provide answers but to highlight the issues faced by Latin American Country providers and patients with orphan disease, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic PH. The authors report the findings of their Latin America collaborative workshop (April 2019) to identify usual care in each country for PH/chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and understand the barriers faced by each country. Information gathering is an important step to identify gaps in health. The authors describe clinic availability, physician expertise, diagnostic testing, and therapeutic options, such as drug dosing, in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. Understanding that this is only a small fraction of Latin American countries, although encompassing most of the population, their data collection and potential registry do provide insight into the existing fragmented care. All countries do not have all currently approved options for PH/CTEPH and also present differences in PH epidemiology. The current guidelines and consensus statements do not guarantee and often have little bearing on clinical practice patterns and the availability of therapies. Economics and geographic desirability limit care in the rural areas of all countries. A major observation raised in the workshop is the challenges of applying the 2018 World Symposium for Pulmonary Hypertension (Nice, France) proceedings to PH treatment in Latin America. Limited medication access and geographic barriers often prevent physicians from aggressively treating patients at high risk of mortality. This problem is compounded by the high cost of the drugs, limited access to high‐quality generic formulations, and lack of coverage by national health programs. Prioritizing education and patient advocacy are recognized as important strategies to maximize the impact of available therapies through early initiation and through discussion with government agencies to include more PH drugs in the formulary. Besides education and therapeutics, the workshop members highlight the importance of conducting clinical, basic, and epidemiological research on PH in Latin America since it is likely that there are unique determinants that could influence treatment response and survival.

"Human monkeypox outbreak: global prevalence and biological, epidemiological and clinical characteristics - observational analysis between 1970-2022.","OBJECTIVE
The human monkeypox infection has become the prevalent orthopoxviral disease in humans, and has developed challenging and threatening situations worldwide. This study is aimed at exploring the global epidemiological, biological and clinical characteristics of monkeypox from 1970 to July 1, 2022.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Information about the monkeypox outbreak and its epidemiological and biological characteristics was obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports, Pub-Med, and Web of Science. Initially, these two leading international health organizations, and 10 documents were identified; after reviewing, we included WHO and CDC, and six documents in the analysis.


RESULTS
Worldwide, from 1970 to July 1, 2022, the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of human monkeypox disease in endemic and non-endemic nations was 46,915. In endemic regions, the number of confirmed cases has been 2,805 and suspected cases have been 38,327, with a total number of 41,132. However, from May 7, 2022, to July 1, 2022, 5,783 monkeypox cases have been found in 52 non-endemic nations in Europe, the UK, the USA, Australia and the Middle East. The majority of cases have been found in the United Kingdom (1,235), Germany (1,054), Spain (800), France (498), United States (459), Portugal (402), Netherlands (288), Canada (287), Italy (192), Belgium (117), Switzerland (91), Israel (42), Ireland (39), Austria (37), Sweden (28), Brazil (21), and Denmark (20). The clinical presentation of monkeypox disease is mild symptoms, including headache, lymphadenopathy, body aches, severe weakness, and acute onset of fever above 38.5°C. A skin rash initiates as macules or papules, progresses to pustules and vesicles, ulcers, and ultimately transitions to crusted scabs. In a short period of about two months, the monkeypox cases swiftly spread in 52 non-endemic countries with an increased percentage worldwide.


CONCLUSIONS
The geographic pattern of monkeypox disease spread is rapidly shifting from endemic to non-endemic regions. It now involves not only Africa but also Europe, the USA, the UK, Australia and the Middle East. The clinical characteristics of monkeypox infection are mostly mild symptoms, including headache, lymphadenopathy, body aches, severe weakness, and acute onset of fever above 38.5 degrees Centigrade. A skin rash originates as macules or papules, progresses to pustules and vesicles, ulcers, and eventually to crusted scabs. The regional and international health establishments must take priority preventive procedures to break the outbreaks of monkeypox disease across the globe. The physicians, healthcare workers, patients, and public education is of utmost importance to eradicate the disease.",2022,11,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63682f6577d2eb32bee0f85e5cb3b545304e6b3f,63682f6577d2eb32bee0f85e5cb3b545304e6b3f,"[{'authorId': '34925091', 'name': 'S.

Trends of research productivity across author gender and research fields: A multidisciplinary and multi-country observational study,"Bibliographic properties of more than 75 million scholarly articles, are examined and trends in overall research productivity are analysed as a function of research field (over the period of 1970–2020) and author gender (over the period of 2006–2020). Potential disruptive effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are also investigated. Over the last decade (2010–2020), the annual number of publications have invariably increased every year with the largest relative increase in a single year happening in 2019 (more than 6% relative growth). But this momentum was interrupted in 2020. Trends show that Environmental Sciences and Engineering Environmental have been the fastest growing research fields. The disruption in patterns of scholarly publication due to the Covid-19 pandemic was unevenly distributed across fields, with Computer Science, Engineering and Social Science enduring the most notable declines. The overall trends of male and female productivity indicate that, in terms of absolute number of publications, the gender gap does not seem to be closing in any country. The trends in absolute gap between male and female authors is either parallel (e.g., Canada, Australia, England, USA) or widening (e.g., majority of countries, particularly Middle Eastern countries). In terms of the ratio of female to male productivity, however, the gap is narrowing almost invariably, though at markedly different rates across countries. While some countries are nearing a ratio of .7 and are well on track for a 0.9 female to male productivity ratio, our estimates show that certain countries (particularly across the Middle East) will not reach such targets within the next 100 years. Without interventional policies, a significant gap will continue to exist in such countries. The decrease or increase in research productivity during the first year of the pandemic, in contrast to trends established before 2020, was generally parallel for male and female authors. There has been no substantial gender difference in the disruption due to the pandemic. However, opposite trends were found in a few cases. It was observed that, in some countries (e.g., The Netherlands, The United States and Germany), male productivity has been more negatively affected by the pandemic. Overall, female research productivity seems to have been more resilient to the disruptive effect of Covid-19 pandemic, although the momentum of female researchers has been negatively affected in a comparable manner to that of males.",2022,9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c94fddc464e45bc2dee4573cfa980dc71ca6ca4,6c94fddc464e45bc2dee4573cfa980dc71ca6ca4,"[{'authorId': '8265765', 'name': 'M.

Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in Vascular Surgery: Time for Multidisciplinary Cross-Border Collaboration,"Access to reliable and meaningful evidence derived from high-quality randomized trials and observational research is essential in clinical decision making and represents evidencebased medicine. Technical achievements over the past decades including the rapid adoption of digital technologies, development of electronic health records (EHRs), widespread high-speed internet access as well as mobile devices, and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) have opened a new era for clinical research and quality improvement using big data methods. Data used for real-world evidence research are provided from various sources such as EHRs, registries, picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), or even self-monitoring devices. Efforts to generate real-world evidence have rapidly pointed to the importance for collaboration between centers and countries to collect, analyze, and report reliable and representative data to build recommendations for clinical practice. With that aim in mind, international registry collaborations across medical and surgical disciplines have been created. In the field of vascular surgery, VASCUNET is a collaboration of clinical and administrative vascular registries that was created in 1997 at the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) annual meeting, and which now counts >40 members from 28 different countries. In the United States (US), the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) collected data from >900,000 vascular procedures performed in the US and in Canada. In 2014, the International Consortium of Vascular Registries (ICVR) was founded and is an umbrella for quality improvement launched in collaboration with the SVS-VQI, ESVS-VASCUNET, and the Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet). More recently, the European Vascular Research Collaborative (EVRC) was implemented as a multidisciplinary research collaborative that aims to facilitate European cross-specialty vascular research. In parallel, the creation of a European Health Data Space has become one of the priorities of the European Commission to promote access and exchange of health data among European institutions not only to support healthcare delivery but also for research. The system is expected to be built in accordance with the European Union (EU) general data protection regulation (GDPR) and may bring promising perspectives for international collaboration. While international registries bring great perspectives to enhance knowledge on the management and the outcomes of patients with vascular diseases worldwide, they mainly focus on clinical and administrative data. Imaging takes a central role in the management of patients with vascular diseases and AI has brought new insights in medical imaging by offering new tools that could help to enhance automatic segmentation and analysis to improve detection, classification, or identification of predictive patterns. Machine learning (ML) models often require a large quantity of data to be trained and validated and data representability is crucial to build accurate and efficient models.

Nansen and Amundsen Basins Observational System (NABOS): Contributing to Understanding Changes in the Arctic,"On September 2, 2002, the Nansen and Amundsen Basins Observational System (NABOS) program deployed its first mooring in the Eastern Eurasian Basin (EEB) of the Arctic Ocean. Since then, NABOS moorings, complemented by repeat multidisciplinary shipborne surveys and Lagrangian drifters (Figure 1), have provided a unique data set in an area of traditionally sparse observations. A series of moorings placed at several strategically important locations continues to be the program’s primary monitoring tool for capturing major near-slope mass, heat, and salt transports and their links to lower-latitude processes. These data will aid in quantifying shelf-basin interactions, documenting water mass transformations, and understanding key mechanisms that lead to the Arctic Ocean’s variability. International collaboration, particularly among the eight Arctic countries, has been an essential part of this observational strategy, with researchers from 18 counties taking part in NABOS cruises since 2002. This observational strategy has paid off well. For example, data collected from the NABOS mooring in 2004 showed a strong warming signal in the warm (temperature >0°C) and salty waters of Atlantic origin (Atlantic Water, AW), suggesting that the eastern Arctic Ocean is in transition toward a new, warmer state (Polyakov et al., 2005). Moreover, NABOS mooring data collected in 2006 in the vicinity of Svalbard at ~30°E showed AW temperature anomalies unprecedented in the history of regional instrumental observations (Ivanov et al., 2009). Concerted efforts of the international team of scientists from the United States, Germany, Russia, and Norway provided evidence that this anomaly took about 1.5 years to propagate from the Norwegian Sea to the Fram Strait region, and it took an additional 4.5 to 5 years to reach the EEB slope. NABOS mooring observations also revealed the structure of the boundary current, showing a sixfold decrease of the current’s speed on the route from Svalbard to the central Laptev Sea (Pnyushkov et al., 2015). NABOS repeat oceanographic transects confirmed the ongoing large-scale warming of the EEB. Furthermore, combined with data provided by other projects, they showed that the warm anomaly found its way further eastward towards the Canadian Basin (Figure 2). This warm pulse peaked in 2007–2008. By the late 2000s, the ocean interior had become slightly cooler (by 0.07°C) relative to the peak years, but still remained much warmer (by ~1°C) compared to the climatology of the 1970s (Polyakov et al., 2012). Enhanced mooring capabilities of the program in the 2010s were critical in documenting and understanding further dramatic changes in the polar basins. These changes are closely related to the progression of anomalies from the Atlantic sector of the sub-Arctic seas into polar latitudes—a process called “Atlantification” (Polyakov et al., 2017). These observed",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e1d724a4f1de1cec5c205dd60b4ff4db1508969d,e1d724a4f1de1cec5c205dd60b4ff4db1508969d,[]
Accuracy of international growth charts to assess nutritional status in children and adolescents: a systematic review,"Abstract Objective: To verify, through a systematic review, the accuracy of nutritional assessment in children and adolescents using the length/height-for-age and BMI-for-age growth charts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2000), the World Health Organization (WHO) (2006/2007) and the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) (2012). Data source: We selected articles from the databases Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), through PubMed, National Library of Medicine and The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) and Virtual Health Library (VHL). The following descriptors were used for the search: “Child”, “Adolescent”, “Nutritional Assessment”, “Growth Chart”, “Ethnic Groups”, “Stature by age”, “Body Mass Index”, “Comparison”, “CDC”, “WHO”, and “IOTF”. The selected articles were assessed for quality through the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies of the NIH. Data synthesis: Thirty-three studies published between 2007 and 2020 were selected and, of these, 20 presented good quality, 12 presented fair quality and one presented poor quality. For children under five years old, the WHO length/height-for-age growth charts were shown appropriate for children from Argentina, South Africa, Brazil, Gabon, Qatar, Pakistan and the United States. For those five years old and older, the WHO BMI-for-age growth charts were accurate for the Brazilian and Canadian populations, while the IOTF growth charts were accurate for the European populations. Conclusions: There are difficulties in obtaining international growth charts for children from 5 years old and older that go along with a long period of growth, and which include genetic, cultural and socioeconomic differences of multiethnic populations who have already overcome the secular trend in height.",2022,6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8cac1d77ee12c136dfd182fa2bf5575a7dcbd4ae,8cac1d77ee12c136dfd182fa2bf5575a7dcbd4ae,"[{'authorId': '2110932601', 'name': 'Mariane Helen de Oliveira'}, {'authorId': '2057576903', 'name': 'Débora dos Santos Pereira'}, {'authorId': '2055603351', 'name': 'D.

African genetic ancestry and protection against fatty liver disease,"Paralleling the obesity epidemics, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (FLD), also named as metabolicassociated FLD,1,2 is becoming an increasing burden to public health worldwide. FLD has a strong genetic component with variations in PNPLA3, TM6SF2, GCKR, MBOAT7, HSD17B13 and other genes increasing the risk of disease onset and progression into cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).3– 6 In a recent study published on Liver International, Mannisto et al. highlighted that genetic predisposition to FLD conferred by these variants, as captured by a polygenic risk score (PRS) predicts liverrelated mortality in the general population independently of classical risk factors.7 In subgroup analysis, the impact was evident in people with FLD, and larger in males than in females.7 The same PRS was linked with the development of severe FLD in adult individuals without strong environmental triggers.8 The latest estimate indicates that worldwide one out of four individuals from the general population is affected by FLD.9 However, the prevalence of FLD differs across the continents. Indeed, Africa has the lowest prevalence of FLD followed by Europe, Asia and Central/South America standing out with the highest prevalence.10,11 In the United States, individuals of African Ancestry are protected, whereas those with Hispanic ancestry are at higher risk.12 A reason contributing to this uneven distribution may be the difference in the genetic architecture of inhabitants of the different continents.10 These epidemiological data are complemented by the clinical observation that individuals of African descent have a lower risk of cirrhosis and HCC, the latest stage of FLD, as compared to Europeans, Asians and Hispanics.11 A major contributor to the interethnic variability in the susceptibility to FLD is represented by the rs738409 single nucleotide polymorphism, encoding for PNPLA3 p.I148M variant.13 Indeed, the variant is more frequent in Hispanics and less frequent in African Americans as compared to individuals of European descent.13 However, even within American populations, there is a large variability. The PNPLA3 p.I148M variant was reported to have a strikingly high prevalence in the Caribbean area. Indeed, the PNPLA3 p.I148M variant had a minor allele frequency 0.69 in Guatemala vs. 0.41 in Mexico and 0.25 in Europeans, which accounted for 30% of the variability of this biomarker of liver damage.14 Furthermore, in a study from Hong Kong, the PNPLA3 p.I148M variant was specifically associated with the development of FLD in lean individuals, a condition that is more frequently observed in people from Asia.15 However, other genetic variants contribute to the FLD predisposition variability across ethnicities. In this issue of Liver International, Kubiliun et al.16 examined differences in the distribution of genetic variants in PNPLA3, TM6SF2, GCKR, MBOAT7 and HSD17B13 between a populationbased sample study from Dallas County and individuals admitted to local hospitals from the same area for suspected liver disease. Stratification by ethnicity showed that in the case of the suspected liver disease there was an enrichment of European Americans and Hispanics as compared to the general population, whereas there was a large depletion of African Americans. This is remarkable because the prevalence of obesity and of other organrelated complications of metabolic disease was higher in African Americans than in other ethnicities.17 Analyses of the genetic predisposition highlighted that Hispanics and European Americans with suspected liver disease had a substantially higher average number of FLD risk alleles. However, this was not the case for African Americans, where this difference did not reach statistical significance. Similar results were obtained by using a PRS composed of the five main FLD genetic variants reported above. Interestingly, after adjusting for age, clinical parameters and genetic risk score, the interethnic differences between European Americans and Hispanics were greatly attenuated, while African Americans had nonetheless a lower risk for FLD. These results point to intrinsic protection against FLD in African Americans not accounted for by the common genetic risk variants examined in the study. However, it is fair to say that the study had a relatively low number of African Americans in the case study group. In addition, diet and lifestyle may also influence the predisposition to develop FLD. Taking all this together, these data support the notion that individuals of African descent harbour private genetic variants protecting against FLD onset and its progression. The identification of these variants, thanks to the higher genetic variability of people of African descent, may therefore lead to highlight a role for previously unknown genes in the pathogenesis of FLD. These data may uncover novel disease pathways, as well as therapeutic targets. Future studies comprising large cohorts of individuals of African descent, as well as from large multiethnic cohorts with detailed genetic characterization and information on diet and lifestyle are therefore warranted to understand the genetic architecture of FLD in this ethnic group and to find potential new targets to treat FLD.",2022,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c770fcd2617603a0560045de529b0b04e310355,0c770fcd2617603a0560045de529b0b04e310355,"[{'authorId': '49091786', 'name': 'S.

Mitochondrial capture and subsequent genetic divergence generates a novel haplogroup: evidence from ancient and ongoing hybridization in mule and white-tailed deer,"Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer) and O. hemionus (mule deer) are sympatric across much of North America. Molecular evidence suggests that up to 24% of individuals in some populations are a product of hybrid ancestry. Several studies have alluded to ancient and recent introgression between Odocoileus spp.; however, no divergence dates were proposed. Herein, phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences obtained from the mitochondrial Cytochrome b gene in 690 individuals identified three clades corresponding to black-tailed deer, white-tailed deer, or a unique combination of both white-tailed deer and mule deer. White-tailed deer and mule deer diverged from a common ancestor of approximately 3.13 mya followed by an ancient hybridization event of approximately 1.32 mya, in which the white-tailed deer mitochondrial genome was “captured” by mule deer. This hybridization event produced a novel haplogroup for white-tailed deer and mule deer located west of the Appalachian Mountains and east of the Cascade Range, south to Veracruz, Mexico, and north to the Yukon Territory, Canada. The ancestral mule deer-like mitochondrial genome appears to be restricted to black-tailed deer distributed along the western portion of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada Ranges of the United States and Canada, whereas the ancestral white-tailed deer-like mitochondrial genome is restricted to the eastern United States and portions of Latin America and Caribbean regions. The “captured mitochondrial genome” has continued on an independent evolutionary trajectory and represents a unique and broadly distributed haplogroup that is 7.25% and 2.84% different from the ancestral mule deer and ancestral white-tailed deer haplogroups, respectively. Odocoileus virginianus (ciervo de cola blanca) y O. hemionus (cievo mulo) son simpátricos a lo largo de Norte América. Evidencia molecular sugiere que en algunas poblaciones un 24% de individuos son el producto de linajes híbridos. Varios estudios aluden introgresiones antiguas y recientes entre Odocoileus spp. sin embargo, no proponen fecha de tal divergencia. En este estudio, los análisis filogenéticos de secuencias de ADN obtenidas del gen mitocondrial citocromo-b de 690 individuos, identificaron tres clados que corresponden al ciervo de cola negra, ciervo de cola blanca, o una combinación única de ciervo de cola blanca y ciervo mulo. El ciervo de cola blanca y el ciervo mulo divergieron de un ancestro común hace aproximadamente 2.65 Ma, seguido de un evento antiguo de hibridación hace aproximadamente 1.12 Ma en donde el genoma mitocondrial del ciervo de cola blanca fue “capturado” por el ciervo mulo. Este evento de hibridación produjo un nuevo haplogrupo en el ciervo de cola blanca y en el ciervo mulo localizados al Oeste de las Montañas Apalaches, al Este de las Cordilleras de Cascadas, al Sur de Veracruz, México, y al Norte del Territorio Yukón en Canadá. El genoma mitocondrial y ancestral semejante al ciervo mulo parece estar restringido al ciervo de cola negra que se distribuye a lo largo de la porción Oeste de las Cordilleras Sierras Nevadas y de la Cordillera de Cascadas de los EE. UU. y Canadá; mientras que, el genoma mitocondrial y ancestral semejante al ciervo de cola blanca se restringe al Este de los EE. UU. y partes de las regiones de Latinoamérica y el Caribe. El “genoma mitocondrial capturado” continuó una trayectoria evolutiva independiente y representa un único haplogrupo distribuido ampliamente siendo 7.25% y 2.84% diferente del haplogrupo del ancestro del ciervo mulo y del ancestro del ciervo de cola blanca respectivamente.",2022,6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d928214180eabd4fc86fc693416545e2ee2a1248,d928214180eabd4fc86fc693416545e2ee2a1248,"[{'authorId': '145078175', 'name': 'E.

Global utilization of online information for substance use disorder: An infodemiological study of Google and Wikipedia from 2004 to 2022.,"INTRODUCTION
The increasing number of people who use drugs (PWUDs) can be attributed to the rising online sales of drugs and other related substances. Information on drugs and drug markets has also become easily accessible in web-search engines and social media. Aside from providing direct care, nurses have essential roles in preventing substance use disorder. These roles include health education, liaison, and researcher. Thus, nurses must examine and utilize the Internet, where information and transactions related to these substances are increasing.


DESIGN/METHODS
This study utilized an infodemiological design in exploring the worldwide information utilization for substance use disorder. Data were gathered from Google Trends and Wikimedia Pageview. The data included relative search volumes (RSV), top and rising related queries and topics, and Wikipedia page views between 2004 and 2022. After describing the data, autoregressive integrated mean averaging (ARIMA) models were used to predict future utilization of online information from Google and Wikipedia.


RESULTS
Google trends ranked 37 countries based on the search volumes for substance use disorder. Ethiopia, Finland, the United States, Kenya, and Canada have the highest RSVs, while the lowest-ranked country is Turkey, followed by Mexico, Spain, Japan, and Indonesia. Google searches for substance use disorder-related information increased by more than 900% between 2004 and 2022. In addition, Wikipedia page views for substance use disorder-related information increased by almost 200% between 2015 and 2022. Based on the ARIMA models, RSVs and page views are predicted to increase by about 150% and 120% by December 2025. Top and rising search-related topics and queries revealed that the public increasingly utilized online information to understand specific substances and the possible mental health comorbidities related to substance use disorders. Their recent concerns revolved around diagnostics, specific substances, and specific disorders.


CONCLUSION
The Internet can be of paradoxical use in substance use disorder. It has been previously reported to be increasingly used in drug trades, contributing to the increasing prevalence of substance use disorder. Likewise, the present study's findings revealed that it is increasingly utilized for substance use disorder-related information. Thus, nurses and other healthcare professionals should ensure that online information regarding substance use disorders is accurate and up-to-date.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Nurse informaticists can form and lead Internet- and social-media-based health teams that perform national infodemiological investigations to assess online information. In doing so, they can inform, expand, and contextualize ehealth substance use education and strengthen the accessibility and delivery of substance use healthcare. In addition, public health nurses can collaborate to engage patients and communities in identifying harmful substance use disorder information online and creating culturally-appropriate messages that will correct misinformation and improve ehealth literacy, specifically in substance use disorder.",2022,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77ff0e0b3827010e720f03ca375a5d9684444e32,77ff0e0b3827010e720f03ca375a5d9684444e32,"[{'authorId': '2087609960', 'name': 'Rowalt C.

Predicting Atlantic Hurricanes Using Machine Learning,"Every year, tropical hurricanes affect North and Central American wildlife and people. The ability to forecast hurricanes is essential in order to minimize the risks and vulnerabilities in North and Central America. Machine learning is a newly tool that has been applied to make predictions about different phenomena. We present an original framework utilizing Machine Learning with the purpose of developing models that give insights into the complex relationship between the land–atmosphere–ocean system and tropical hurricanes. We study the activity variations in each Atlantic hurricane category as tabulated and classified by NOAA from 1950 to 2021. By applying wavelet analysis, we find that category 2–4 hurricanes formed during the positive phase of the quasi-quinquennial oscillation. In addition, our wavelet analyses show that super Atlantic hurricanes of category 5 strength were formed only during the positive phase of the decadal oscillation. The patterns obtained for each Atlantic hurricane category, clustered historical hurricane records in high and null tropical hurricane activity seasons. Using the observational patterns obtained by wavelet analysis, we created a long-term probabilistic Bayesian Machine Learning forecast for each of the Atlantic hurricane categories. Our results imply that if all such natural activity patterns and the tendencies for Atlantic hurricanes continue and persist, the next groups of hurricanes over the Atlantic basin will begin between 2023 ± 1 and 2025 ± 1, 2023 ± 1 and 2025 ± 1, 2025 ± 1 and 2028 ± 1, 2026 ± 2 and 2031 ± 3, for hurricane strength categories 2 to 5, respectively. Our results further point out that in the case of the super hurricanes of the Atlantic of category 5, they develop in five geographic areas with hot deep waters that are rather very well defined: (I) the east coast of the United States, (II) the Northeast of Mexico, (III) the Caribbean Sea, (IV) the Central American coast, and (V) the north of the Greater Antilles.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e9f48474ba76be213f6186d7fac766842dc16c0,0e9f48474ba76be213f6186d7fac766842dc16c0,"[{'authorId': '51240180', 'name': 'V.

Quality and Innovations in the Financial Reporting as a Way to Increase Attractiveness for Institutional Investors,"At the present stage of global development there is a transition from understanding the financial statements of enterprises not only as a source of quantitative indicators of the company's development but also as a reputable tool for its reliability and readiness for transparent relations with counterparties. Investment decision-making has always been characterized by balancing profitability and reliability of capital investment. Accordingly, this requires increasing emphasis on the quality and complexity of companies' financial reporting, allowing you to maximize the amount of information provided to potential investors. The article aims to test the hypothesis about the impact of qualitative characteristics of financial reporting on the attractiveness of companies to investors. The study analyzes the evolution of financial reporting, the causes and consequences of innovative approaches to its preparation, and the dissemination of national and international standards. The second stage of the analysis involves modeling the impact of financial reporting and investment attractiveness of enterprises at the national level through economic and mathematical modeling (the specificity of the model is determined by testing the quantitative input data). According to the results of the study of financial reporting quality indicators, the general parameter is the strength of auditing and reporting standards, which the World Economic Forum assesses based on a survey of business leaders. Indicators of the country's investment attractiveness calculated by the World Bank's global statistical base were chosen as dependent variables. Calculations are performed on panel data for a sample of more than 20 countries (Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Estonia, Georgia, Ghana, Greece, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Morocco, Mexico, Mongolia, New Zealand, Romania, Turkey, United States) over ten years. The obtained results of calculations are the basis for finding ways to improve further the quality of financial and nonfinancial disclosure of companies to increase their competitiveness in the investment market.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f2ff0d3cf0268798f5fa6b6c23e00e093fb63a33,f2ff0d3cf0268798f5fa6b6c23e00e093fb63a33,"[{'authorId': '2101140218', 'name': 'Zohrab Ibrahimov'}, {'authorId': '2094572314', 'name': 'Sakina Hajiyeva'}, {'authorId': '2101029686', 'name': 'Vuqar Nazarov'}, {'authorId': '98374079', 'name': 'A.

“Downstreaming” Policy Supporting the Competitiveness of Indonesian Cocoa in the Global Market,"Indonesia is one of the cocoa producing countries, where most of it is exported to foreign countries and the rest is marketed domestically. Indonesia cocoa export performance in the world market certainly opens up many opportunities. It is necessary to optimize the potency and competitiveness of its cocoa if Indonesia would make the cocoa exports as the driving of national economy. The objectives of this paper are to (1) analyze Indonesian cocoa performance in the global market compared to its competitors and (2) analyze the competitiveness and market position of Indonesian cocoa in global market and analyze the potency to develop market in 10 main trading partners. The data analysis methods used are the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA), Trade Specialization Index (TSI) and Export Product Dynamics (EDP). The result shows that the comparative competitiveness of Indonesian cocoa beans and processed cocoa is lower than that of other producing countries. However, Indonesia still has the potency to develop market for its cocoa products in several countries such as the United States, China, India, Canada, Mexico and Estonia. Some efforts to improve the competitiveness of Indonesian cocoa beans may be through the replanting for estates rejuvenation and the improvement of fermentation to improve the quality of cocoa beans. In addition, to enhance the export performance of cocoa base products in general, it is necessary to also improve the development of downstream line and processing industries.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08d979239474a2a892d77d0c1550188753937877,08d979239474a2a892d77d0c1550188753937877,"[{'authorId': '108713465', 'name': 'I.

Persistent Airway Plugs: A Call for Clinical Recognition and Novel Therapies,"Much has been written about mucus accumulation and plugging of the airway lumen as pathologic features of asthma. SirWilliamOsler (1849–1919) made early clinical descriptions of “gelatinous mucus expectoration by asthmatics” that were subsequently recognized in pathological specimens by Huber and Koessler (1), Dunnill (2), and many others. Despite this, the role of intraluminal mucus in the clinical presentation of asthma, and its contribution to airflow obstruction, have not been extensively studied. Further, very little attention has been made by most international guidelines to recognize or treat mucus impaction of the airways in asthma, nor is it considered in daily clinical practice. This has likely been in part owing to our inability to directly measure airway mucus plugging in vivo, with most of our knowledge gained from postmortem pathology. In 2018, Dunican and colleagues were the first to describe the radiographic “mucus score” as the summation of bronchopulmonary segments with one or more mucus plugs visualized on computed tomography (CT) lung scans (3). Since this initial report, the recognition of CT as a noninvasive means to quantify the burden of mucus plugging in vivo has garnered significant clinical interest. Although the term “mucus plug” has generally been accepted to describe the CT observation of complete occlusion of the airway lumen (3–8), it is important to recognize nuances of the mucus score. First, the composition of CT-visible intraluminal plugs has not been directly characterized and may contain not only mucus but also inflammatory cells, plasma exudate, extracellular traps, and Charcot–Leyden crystals. Second, peripheral airways are beyond the spatial resolution limit of CT, and therefore, the score is representative of mucus plugs in the larger proximal airways. Third, partial occlusions of the airway lumen are not scored. Finally, the score for each bronchopulmonary segment is binary (0 or 1), with no weight given to the proximal location of plugging (segmental vs. subsegmental), plug size, or the number of airways involved within an individual bronchopulmonary segment. Regardless of these uncertainties and potential limitations, crosssectional cohort studies from the United States (85 of 146 [58%]) (3), United Kingdom (69 of 116 [60%]) (8), and Canada (18 of 27 [66%]) (6) conclusively agree that mucus plugging assessed by the CT mucus score is surprisingly common in severe asthma. With that preface, in this issue of the Journal, Tang and colleagues (pp. 1036–1045) take advantage of baseline and Year 3 chest CT scans acquired from the SARP-3 (Severe Asthma Research Program-3) study to provide new information regarding the temporal behavior of airway mucus plugs and their relationship with changes in lung function (9). Mucus plugs observed on CT were discovered to be a persistent asthma phenotype. This is supported by the observation that 82% of people with asthma with airway mucus plugs reported on their baseline CT also had mucus plugs on their follow-up scan acquired 3 years later. A less compelling but similar observation was made at the level of the bronchopulmonary segment, where 65% of segments with mucus plugs at baseline were reported to have mucus plugs at follow-up.Without additional time points, it is unknown if the plugs truly persisted in the same location throughout the duration of the study or if they resolved and reoccurred. Regardless, the segmental agreement across two time points implicates the local airway environment in the formation of mucus plugs and perhaps a vicious feedback mechanism. The urgent need to reduce the burden of airway mucus is underscored by the observation that mucus is an important and perhaps dominant contributor to airflow obstruction, asthma severity, and control. Temporal changes in the mucus plug score were associated with changes in airflow obstruction measured by FEV1% predicted, FVC% predicted, and FEV1/FVC. These global structure–function associations reported by Tang and colleagues are supported by elegant magnetic resonance imaging studies that visualize the functional consequence of an individual mucus plug on distal airflow obstruction (5, 6). Taken together, there is now compelling evidence supporting a causal role for mucus plugs as a major mechanism of airflow obstruction in asthma. While there was no net change in the mucus score between baseline and Year 3, decreases in blood and sputum eosinophil counts were associated with decreases in the mucus score. Additionally, asthmatics with persistent mucus plugging had elevated biomarkers of T2 inflammation, including sputum eosinophils and fractional exhaled nitric oxide. This raises the question, “if therapy had been adjusted to normalize sputum eosinophil counts, would the conclusion that mucus plugs are persistent in existence and location hold true?” It seems likely that if steroid doses were adjusted to normalize eosinophils, mucus plugs would concomitantly decrease or resolve. Our own data support this notion as two-thirds of people with severe asthma with,3% sputum eosinophils were mucus free (6). Furthermore, the expression of MUC5A is decreased when treatment is adjusted to normalize sputum eosinophils (10). However, it is important to recognize that of the SARP-3 subjects with asthma with persistent mucus plugging, 74% were prescribed high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, and 23% were oral corticosteroid dependent. This suggests that mucus plugs are resistant, at least in part, to maintenance corticosteroid therapies. Unfortunately, very few SARP-3 subjects with asthma were receiving monoclonal antibody therapies targeting IL-5 signaling (21 of 164 [13%]); therefore, the study was not powered to comment on the ability of IL-5 blockage to resolve mucus that might be associated with eosinophils.

"Web-Based Service Provision of HIV, Viral Hepatitis, and Sexually Transmitted Infection Prevention, Testing, Linkage, and Treatment for Key Populations: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Background Despite the growth of web-based interventions for HIV, viral hepatitis (VH), and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) for key populations, the evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions has not been reported. Objective This study aimed to inform the World Health Organization guidelines for HIV, VH, and STI prevention, diagnosis, and treatment services for key populations by systematically reviewing the effectiveness, values and preferences, and costs of web-based outreach, web-based case management, and targeted web-based health information for key populations (men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who inject drugs, trans and gender-diverse people, and people in prisons and other closed settings). Methods We searched CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Embase in May 2021 for peer-reviewed studies; screened abstracts; and extracted data in duplicate. The effectiveness review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for RCTs and the Evidence Project and Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions tools for non-RCTs. Values and preferences and cost data were summarized descriptively. Results Of 2711 records identified, we included 13 (0.48%) articles in the effectiveness review (3/13, 23% for web-based outreach; 7/13, 54% for web-based case management; and 3/13, 23% for targeted web-based health information), 15 (0.55%) articles in the values and preferences review, and 1 (0.04%) article in the costs review. Nearly all studies were conducted among men who have sex with men in the United States. These articles provided evidence that web-based approaches are as effective as face-to-face services in terms of reaching new people, use of HIV, VH, and STI prevention services, and linkage to and retention in HIV care. A meta-analysis of 2 RCTs among men who have sex with men in China found increased HIV testing after web-based outreach (relative risk 1.39, 95% CI 1.21-1.60). Among men who have sex with men in the United States, such interventions were considered feasible and acceptable. One cost study among Canadian men who have sex with men found that syphilis testing campaign advertisements had the lowest cost-per-click ratio on hookup platforms compared with more traditional social media platforms. Conclusions Web-based services for HIV, VH, and STIs may be a feasible and acceptable approach to expanding services to key populations with similar outcomes as standard of care, but more research is needed in low-resource settings, among key populations other than men who have sex with men, and for infections other than HIV (ie, VH and STIs).",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/17f6fe08e816f252c5ab95bc99f32af700933452,17f6fe08e816f252c5ab95bc99f32af700933452,"[{'authorId': '4201927', 'name': 'P.

Editorial for a special issue on innovating the mathematics curriculum in precarious times,"There is emerging interest among some mathematics education scholars in questions around mathematics and mathematics education in relation to the multiple, related issues of climate change, poverty, inequality, health crises, discrimination, and totalitarianism. This interest can be seen in an increasing, but still relatively small, number of submissions on these topics to journals and, for instance, journal special issues including Mathematics Education and the Living World (edited by Boylan & Coles, 2017); Mathematics for “Citizenship” and its “Other” in a “Global” World: Critical Issues on Mathematics Education, Globalisation and Local Communities (edited by Chronaki & Yolcu, 2021); and Mathematics Education in a Time of Crisis – A Viral Pandemic (edited by Chan et al., 2021). Mathematics education scholarship has, for many years, explored the socio-political aspects of mathematics and mathematics education in local and global difference and precarity, for example, work within critical mathematics education (e.g. Gutstein, 2012; Sakonidis et al., 1994; Vithal, 2002) and ethnomathematics (e.g. D’Ambrosio, 2006; Mosimege, 2017; Rosa & Orey, 2011). Yet, what appears new is an explicit turn towards ecology (Coles, 2022) and a de-centring of the human perspective. There is growing recognition – not new, but illuminated by the recent global health pandemic and extreme climate-related events – of a changing, precarious world and the need for mathematics education to account for its role and have a response. One of the connections between us, as guest editors, was our involvement in a project funded by the Worldwide Universities Network (WUN) that aimed to consider how the mathematics curriculum, in Higher Education contexts, could innovate to become more relevant to the world we find ourselves in. The WUN project involved a network of researchers and their universities, in different parts of the world (Canada, Hong Kong, Mexico, South Africa, the United Kingdom and theUnited States), pursuing different curriculum development and research initiatives that all fell under the umbrella of Innovating the Mathematics Curriculum in Times of Change: Towards Local and Global Relevance. This project was conceptualised in 2019, and enacted from 2020 during the unexpected COVID-19 pandemic. Two of the articles that follow (Helliwell & Ng, 2022; Solares-Rojas et al., 2022) arise from that project. We see as significant that there are many co-authors across the articles in the Special Issue and that the articles encompass work which took place across five continents. One of our central aims in planning this Special Issue was to offer new perspectives and findings that help us consider a mathematics curriculum in precarious times, at any level of schooling or Higher Education, or out-of-school contexts. By curriculum we mean the knowledge or knowings that are intended, implemented or attained. Precarity points to living life without promise and stability, and with vulnerability to others. In this Editorial, we set out some of the thinking that led us to propose and frame the Special Issue in the way we have, and we then look forward to the articles that follow.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9681befbef82a283a4e57e12b899511b27ae33e,e9681befbef82a283a4e57e12b899511b27ae33e,"[{'authorId': '1749210564', 'name': 'Kate le Roux'}, {'authorId': '47329398', 'name': 'Julian Brown'}, {'authorId': '46865656', 'name': 'Alf Coles'}, {'authorId': '72823235', 'name': 'T.

Physician‐Assisted Dying: Access and Utilization in Patients with Movement Disorders,"Palliative care has become increasingly widespread and demonstrated extraordinary utility in improving quality of life in patients with neurological diseases, particularly surrounding end-of-life care. However, there is ongoing debate on whether physician-assisted dying (PAD) for people with terminal illnesses should also be a legal right. Healthcare professionals, including those in the field of movement disorders, provide care for people with illnesses that may reach a point where medical interventions will not extend life or improve the quality of remaining life. In the state of California, the End of Life Option (EOLO) Act was enacted on June 9, 2016, which allows patients with terminal illnesses and grave prognoses to choose to end their lives by self-administered medications otherwise known as PAD. To be eligible to participate in the EOLO program in California, patients must have a terminal diagnosis with a prognosis of 6 months or less. The patient, and only the patient, must express an interest to end their life through the program on two separate occasions separated by a minimum of 2 weeks. The patient must have the “physical and mental ability to self-administer the aid-in-dying drug.” Importantly, the patient’s power of attorney, advance health care directive, conservator, health care agent, or surrogate may not request these drugs on a patient’s behalf. Medical decision-making capacity is determined by the individual’s physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist and involves individuals needing to understand and communicate their decision to healthcare providers. The term “self-administer,” according to the written law, is defined as “qualified individual’s affirmative, conscious, and physical act of administering and ingesting the aid-in-dying drug” but does not further specify the route of administration. In the United States, there are currently 10 states/ jurisdictions that have similar PAD statutes in place: California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Each of the participating states has similar inclusion criteria as described earlier. Outside of the United States, there are eight countries (Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Canada including Quebec, Colombia, and Australia including Victoria and Western Australia) that have legalized either PAD or euthanasia. Euthanasia differs from PAD in that euthanasia refers to “the act of intentionally ending the life of a patient by a health care practitioner through medical means at that patient’s explicit request to alleviate suffering” while PAD involves the provision or prescribing of drugs by a health care practitioner for a patient to end their own life. PAD specifically refers to “a physician providing, at the patient’s request, a prescription for a lethal dose of medication that the patient can self-administer by ingestion, with the explicit intention of ending life.” Since the EOLO Act became law in California, 1985 individuals have requested PAD. In 2019, 736 individuals had started the PAD process, 618 obtained aid-indying medications, and 405 people were reported to have completed the process. More than two-thirds (67.5%) had cancer as their terminal diagnosis, while neurological conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease made up the second largest disease group at 10.1% in that year. Since 2016, neurological conditions have consistently been the second largest group participating in PAD following cancer in California. This is similar to the trend in Oregon and Washington, states with a 30-year history of medical assistance in dying. In this article, we aim to describe our experiences with PAD as a tertiary care center for movement disorders and discuss the need for © 2022 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/398e5ed7cbc1edc603d2012f581ac90f46d8fb84,398e5ed7cbc1edc603d2012f581ac90f46d8fb84,"[{'authorId': '2072765696', 'name': 'Lisa Damron'}, {'authorId': '7725461', 'name': 'E.

Diabetes epidemiology: Analysis of trends over time,"A useful analysis approach is to look over time at changes in relationships between various conditions and outcomes. A fascinating graphic website based on data from the Global Burden of Disease study allows comparison of deaths, years of life lost, and various measures of disability from various causes over time from 1990 to 2019 (https:// vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/). Using this tool, diabetes accounted for 1.42% of global deaths in 1990 and for 2.74% in 2019. the tool allows estimation of diabetes deaths from metabolic, behavioral, and environmental causes; of deaths from type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D); of deaths from chronic kidney disease; and many other potential variables, and I encourage the reader to visit the site and experiment! Several recent articles exemplify the study of changes over time, giving fascinating insight into various aspects of diabetes and its complications. A group of investigators reported a T1D global microsimulation model, estimating that the incidence rate of T1D increased from around 9 to 13.7 per 100 000 persons from 1990 to 2021, with a projected further 1.29-fold increase to 17.6 per 100 000 in 2050. Incidence varied substantially by region, from 3.4 per 100 000 in Japan to 61.9 per 100 000 in Finland. In addition, the investigators found marked regional variability in the prevalence of undiagnosed T1D, ranging from 5% in Australia and New Zealand, North America, and western and northern Europe, to more than 65% in west Africa, south and southeast Asia, and Melanesia. Using data from high-income regions with >1.5 billion person-years of observation, with >5 million persons developing T2D between 2005 and 2019, the lifetime risk of diabetes before age 80 ranged from 14% to 54%. Despite the decrease over time in association with a decrease in T2D incidence in most of the regions studied, lifetime risk generally exceeded 30%. Life expectancy for persons with T2D at age 20 was 44–59 years in men and 54–64 years in women, and T2D was associated with a range from 3 to 13 years of life lost, particularly with development at younger ages. A study using administrative health care data for >10 000 000 persons from Ontario, Canada analyzed the 5-year risk association between diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) from 1994 to 2019, during which time the prevalence of diabetes increased from 3.1% to 9.0% and that of CVD increased from 2.5% to 3.7% of the population. The relative risk of CV events with either diabetes alone or CVD alone in 1994 was 2.06and 2.16-fold greater than in persons with neither condition. In 2014 the relative risk of a CV event in persons with diabetes was 1.58-fold, whereas that of persons with CVD alone was 2.06-fold greater than in those with neither condition, leading the authors to suggest that “diabetes is still an important cardiovascular risk factor but no longer equivalent to CVD” The German/Austrian Diabetes Patient Follow-up Registry (Diabetes-Patienten-Verlaufsdokumentation— DPV), the England/Wales National Pediatric Diabetes Audit, and the Type 1 Diabetes Exchange in the United States reported trends among persons with T1D averaging age 13.5; insulin pumps were used by 41%, 19%, and 56% of those in the respective groups in 2012, and by 55%, 41%, and 73% in 2018, and continuous glucose monitoring use increased from 4% to 6% in 2010 to 64%, 13%, and 40% in the respective groups in 2018. However, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) averaged 7.7%, 8.7%, and 8.0% in 2010 and 7.6%, 7.9%, and 8.5% in 2018, leading the authors to suggest that simple adoption of pump and continuous glucose monitor use may be “insufficient to reduce HbA1c”.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/462633dc47aea378bc9fa210cede842289cfa74e,462633dc47aea378bc9fa210cede842289cfa74e,"[{'authorId': '5467280', 'name': 'Z.

"Chemical defense strategies, induction timing, growth, and trade‐offs in
 Pinus aristata
 and
 Pinus flexilis","Trade-offs between plant defense investment and fitness traits, including growth, are often invoked to explain evolutionary strategies targeted at resisting herbivores. Many Pinus species have specialized herbivores, including the mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae , and have histori-cally been a focus of defense investigations. We compared defense traits of two high-elevation Pinus species, P. aristata and P. flexilis , that are hosts to MPB and hypothesized to have different growth and defense traits and potential trade-offs. Interspecific differences were assessed by sampling trees within the same stands, and intraspecific differences were assessed by sampling stands at sites across latitudes where both species co-occurred. Constitutive defenses were measured at Day 0, and the timing, concentration, and composition of an induced resin defense response were assessed by sampling at 1, 4, and 30 days following either mechanical wounding only or a simulated MPB attack using its primary fungal symbiont Grosmannia clavigera . At Day 4, induced resin concentrations did not differ between mechanical wounding and simulated MPB attack in either species. By Day 30, resin defense concentrations in response to simulated MPB attack were greater than those in response to mechanical wounding and were >19-fold greater than constitutive levels. Results suggest that initial induced resin defense responses in the two species are likely generalized, with a delayed response that is targeted specifically at MPB and G. clavigera . At all sites, P. aristata had higher concentrations of constitutive and Day-30 induced resin defenses than P. flexilis , although P. flexilis induced proportionately more. Trade-offs in growth and defense between the species were only found at the two most climatically favorable sites where P. aristata grew slower than P. flexilis . No trade-offs were found between the two defense types at either biological scale. Overall, our findings highlight that the two pine species growing in the same stands (1) have a delayed response to a specialized native herbivore and fungal symbiont, (2) only exhibited interspecific defense – growth trade-offs at two climatically favorable sites, and showed no intraspecific defense – growth trade-offs, (3) showed no trade-offs between constitutive and induced defenses at either biological scale, and (4) have evolved different defense strategies.

"Meal Frequency, Metabolic Health, and Social Norms","Eating habits play an important role in protecting and promoting one’s metabolic health. Meal frequency, an eating habit, has long been a topic of research owing to its relationship with metabolic health. The regular consumption of three meals—breakfast, lunch, and dinner— is considered the norm in traditional Korean society. Even now, three meals a day remains the most common eating pattern in Korea. Although increased meal frequency is considered favorable for metabolic health, observational studies of meal frequency and metabolic health have reported inconsistent results. Various classifications of eating frequencies, under-reporting of dietary intake, and reverse causality are the suggested reasons for these inconsistent results. Epidemiological studies in Korea suggested that a decreased eating frequency is associated with poor metabolic health, especially in men. Kim et al. reported that the eating frequency of Korean adults was inversely correlated with various obesity indicators, including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and body fat percentage, when diet quality was high. Jung et al. showed that Korean men who ate three meals a day had a lower likelihood of metabolic syndrome than those who ate two or fewer meals a day. In the present issue, Park et al. showed that Korean adults who ate three regular meals a day had lower BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and serum triglycerides than those eating two or fewer regular meals a day. In contrast, a prospective cohort study by Kahleova et al. reported that eating one or two meals a day was associated with a relative decrease in BMI versus eating three meals a day. Their study participants were adult members of Seventh-day Adventist churches in the United States and Canada. Seventhday Adventists traditionally eat two large meals a day (breakfast and lunch). In other words, their social norms for meal patterns differ from those of most Korean adults. The gap between the results of this study and other studies in Korea might be attributable to different social norms of meal patterns between study subjects. Eating behaviors are strongly influenced by sociocultural context. Adhering to social norms is a common feature of higher socioeconomic classes who are more aware of health information. In addition, subjects following their society’s meal pattern norms are more likely to follow other health-related social norms. A cross-sectional study conducted in Sweden showed that a high daily eating frequency was associated with an overall healthy lifestyle, including non-smoking, lower alcohol consumption, and higher leisure-time physical activity. In the present issue, Park et al. also reported that subjects who consumed three regular meals a day were more likely to be non-smokers, never-drinkers, and dietary supplement users. However, meal frequencies may have different correlations with other health-related behaviors in societies with different social norms for meal patterns. In epidemiological studies conducted in Korean society, where eating three regular meals is a social norm, decreased eating frequency was associated with poor metabolic health. However, it is difficult to determine whether these devastating health effects were directly due to decreased eating frequency or, alternatively, an attitude that does not adhere to social norms. Thus, sociocultural context should be considered when interpreting epidemiological findings regarding meal frequencies and metabolic health.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2686660b285f610d3d72ef098daa165a3d0a5766,2686660b285f610d3d72ef098daa165a3d0a5766,"[{'authorId': '2158008510', 'name': 'Y.

Bringing the Pediatric Endocrine Spanish Speaking Community Together: First Virtual Pediatric Endocrine Meeting in Low- and Middle-Income Countries in Central and South America,"Background Pediatric endocrinology is a specialty that is struggling worldwide to maintain adequately trained professionals. Pediatric endocrine care in Central America and Caribbean countries is often performed by pediatricians or adult endocrinologists due to the limited number of pediatric endocrinologists. These health care providers are seldom members of endocrine societies and frequently lack formal training in the field. Objective In this study, we describe the scope of a virtual conference in pediatric endocrinology and diabetes targeted to low- and middle-income countries to provide equal opportunities for access to medical education for health care professionals. Methods The virtual conference was sponsored by the Pediatric Endocrine Society (North America), Asociación Costarricense de Endocrinología (previously, Asociación Nacional Pro Estudio de la Diabetes, Endocrinología y Metabolismo), and Asociacion Centroamericana y del Caribe de Endocrinologia Pediátrica. The conference was free to participants and comprised 23 sessions that were either synchronous with ability for real-time interactive sessions or asynchronous sessions, where content was available online to access at their convenience. Topics included idiopathic short stature, polycystic ovarian syndrome, diabetes mellitus, telemedicine, Turner syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, obesity, central precocious puberty, and subclinical hypothyroidism. The participants were asked to evaluate the conference after its completion with a questionnaire. Results A total of 8 speakers from Spain, Canada, Costa Rica, and the United States delivered the virtual event to 668 health care professionals from Guatemala, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, Mexico, Honduras, Argentina, the United States, Bolivia, Chile, Panama, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Belize, Spain, and Colombia. Name, profession, and country were fully disclosed by 410 (61.4%) of the 668 health care professionals. The profession or level of training of participants were as follows: pediatric endocrinologists (n=129, 19.3%), pediatricians (n=116, 17.4%), general practitioners (n=77, 11.5%), adult endocrinologists (n=34, 5.1%), medical students (n=23, 3.4%), residents in various specialties (n=14, 2.1%), and others (n=17, 2.6%). A total of 23 sessions were offered, most of which were bilingual (Spanish and English). Feedback from the evaluation questionnaire indicated that the content of the conference was very relevant to the participants’ professional practice. Additionally, the participants reported that they were very satisfied with the organization, the web-based platform, and the sessions of the conference. Conclusions Lack of accessibility to the latest and cutting-edge medical education in pediatric endocrinology and diabetes for medical professionals from low- and middle-income countries can be overcome with a virtual conference. Online availability, low cost, and easy-to-use technology were well received from the participants, who were overall very satisfied by the quality and the relevance of the sessions to their professional practice.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8f997ea8479b9cfaccfa8d016fb5bd3474059c9d,8f997ea8479b9cfaccfa8d016fb5bd3474059c9d,"[{'authorId': '8575124', 'name': 'R.

A New Megasport Legacy,"Though the Qatar 2022 FIFA Men’s World Cup is for many a symbol of long-standing corruption and human rights problems, the event may actually represent something entirely new. Megasports are now demonstrating a capacity to leave what this book calls a human rights and anti-corruption legacy: norms, practices, policies, or laws that have application beyond sport, are likely to endure after the event, and the implementation of which is accelerated by hosting the event. In the 2010s, Brazil’s hosting of the FIFA Men’s World Cup and Summer Olympics, and then South Korea’s hosting of the Winter Olympics, left what this book calls reactive, accidental, and one-dimensional anti-corruption legacies. Most would be shocked to find that Qatar now moves this legacy concept forward, undertaking to create megasports’ first intentional and proactive human rights legacy. The first and perhaps best opportunity to build a proactive, intentional, and two-dimensional human rights and anti-corruption legacy lies in France as it prepares to host the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics while implementing new landmark anti-corruption and human rights laws. The concept may still advance in Australia and New Zealand (2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup) and Italy (2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics). However, the United Bid of Canada, the United States, and Mexico has promised the first proactive, intentional, and two-dimensional human rights and anti-corruption (“HRAC”) legacy around the 2026 FIFA Men’s World Cup. This book analyzes existing megasport policies and practices, then suggests reforms to acknowledge and support these new legacies.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d9ce2a3aa732bce255bc4e790824bc3cc7421e4,6d9ce2a3aa732bce255bc4e790824bc3cc7421e4,"[{'authorId': '103528339', 'name': 'A.

Invited Perspective: Household Air Pollution—Can Randomized Controlled Trials Provide the Answers to Complex Intervention Questions?,"Worldwide, roughly 3:8 billion people heat or cook with wood and other solid fuels, which exposes them to numerous household air pollutants associated with ill health. Household air pollution exerts an immense toll on human health, contributing to an estimated 2:31million deaths in 2019. Although rural U.S. populations have lower average ambient exposures to particulate matter ≤2:5 lm in aerodynamic diameter [fine PM (PM2:5)] than urban populations, rural homes that are heated with woodstoves have higher exposure to indoor air pollution than those that use other sources of heating, such as electricity. Of the 12:5million U.S. homes that burn wood for space heating, 3:5million use woodstoves as the primary source of heating. For homes that use inefficient woodstoves, indoor levels of PM2:5 can exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Ambient Air Quality Standard of <35lg=m3 over a 24-h period. Given that PM2:5 exposure is associated with adverse health effects, such as child lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), it is important that people who heat their homes with wood not only have access to interventions that reduce these household exposures, but also that they use them consistently and correctly. The Kids Air Quality Interventions for Reducing Respiratory Infections (KidsAIR) study is a parallel three-arm (education, portable air filtration unit, control groups) randomized controlled trial to reduce incidence of child LRTI in households that use woodstoves for heating. KidsAIR was conducted at three sites: Alaska Native communities in Alaska, rural communities inMontana, and Navajo communities on the Navajo Nation (Arizona and New Mexico). In this issue of Environmental Health Perspectives, Walker et al. report that although the intention-to-treat results were not statistically significant, an exposure–response analysis indicated that the odds of LRTI were 1.45 times higher [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 2.05] per interquartile range increase in mean indoor PM2:5. 10 The KidsAIR study is unique in that the preponderance of research on household air pollution has been conducted in settings outside of the United States. Yet nearly 10% of U.S. households use wood for primary or secondary heating. Of those households that use wood for primary heating, over half report an annual income of less than $60,000 and live in a cold or very cold region. In Navajo County, Arizona, where 44% of the population is Native American, 28% of households use wood for heating. By recruiting from rural and American Indian/Alaska Native communities, this studymakes an important contribution to highlighting environmental health inequities among rural U.S. populations that use woodstoves for heating. One major strength of the KidsAIR study is its commendable diagnostic specificity; a pediatric pulmonologist conducted a rigorous masked assessment of LRTI by reviewing medical charts, and health technicians conducted in-home prospective assessments. Another commendable strength of this study is the implementation of community advisory boards to shape the trial, including input on the development of educational materials, inclusion of households with tobacco smokers, and the implementation of control arm procedures. For example, at the Alaska study site, the community advised against the use of a sham filtration unit in the control arm. Although including smokers may confound the effect of air pollution on LRTI, and a lack of a placebo may lead to a host of biases, the investigators demonstrated a commitment to community feedback. Their sensitivity analyses, assessing the effects of smoking by allowing the inclusion of household smokers, and exclusion of the Alaskan subgroup, found that these factors did not appreciably change the studyfindings. From 2002 to 2005, I worked on the Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects (RESPIRE) in Guatemala. The late Dr. Kirk R. Smith established this randomized controlled trial of a wood-fueled chimney cookstove in rural Indigenous Mam Mayan households in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the stove intervention was associated with a 22% reduction in physician-diagnosed child pneumonia, but, as in the KidsAIR study, the findings were not statistically significant (95% CI: –6%, 41%). However, an exposure–response analysis did show that a 50% decrease in exposure to household air pollution, specifically carbon monoxide, was associated with a 28% reduction in child pneumonia (relative risk= 0:82; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.98). These results prompted support for the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial, this time providing clean-fuel stoves that would radically improve indoor air quality in 3,200 households in Guatemala, India, Rwanda, and Peru. The randomized controlled trial is the gold standard for assessing causality; however, interventions at the household level under real-world conditions are complex and can lead to null findings for many reasons, one of which is fidelity to the intervention. Although the KidsAIR study paid electrical costs in participating homes, the median use of the air filtration unit was only 56% of the expected kilowatt hours, demonstrating low compliance with the intervention. The authors did not discuss efforts to encourage adherence to the filtration units, but low compliance could have reduced the strength of effect. The authors stated that as compliance increased over the 6-d period of measure, indoor PM2:5 did not decrease. This seems counterintuitive because the purpose of the trial was to reduce PM2:5 using an air filtration unit. Furthermore, even if the participants complied during the 6-d period of measure, does this accurately represent PM2:5 exposures and compliance with the intervention when the investigators are not present? A single 6-d sampling period may not represent the long-term exposures over a 2-y observation Address correspondence to Lisa M.

LANGUAGE MEANS OF EXPRESSIVENESS IN ENGLISH-LANGUAGE MILITARY PUBLICATIONS,"Введение. На основе лингвостилистического анализа статей из англоязычных военных журналов изучаются языковые средства выразительности публикаций военной направленности, глубокое знание которых позволяет читающему понимать не только информативный, но и эмоциональный элемент их содержания. Цель – описать многообразие и особенности применения языковых средств выразительности в современных англоязычных военных публикациях. Материал и методы. Изучены диссертационные работы и научные статьи в периодических изданиях по филологии германских языков за последние 10 лет, а также публикации в таких англоязычных журналах военной направленности, как Air Force News, Australian Defence Force Journal, Canadian Military Journal, Defence Turkey, Raider, освещающие деятельность и состояние вооруженных сил Великобритании, США, Австралии, Турции, Канады и других государств. Использованы общенаучные методы теоретического анализа, наблюдения, обобщения, конкретизации.Результаты и обсуждение. Обзор публикаций по филологии германских языков за последнее десятилетие подтверждает недостаточную изученность проблематики использования языковых средств выразительности в англоязычных военных публикациях и актуальность проведения более глубоких исследований в этой области языкознания.Анализ содержания англоязычных военных журналов указывает на то, что в статьях военной направленности доминируют военно-политический и научно-технический стили, хотя в них также комбинируются элементы художественного, разговорного и рекламного текста, а соединение элементов различных функциональных стилей в публицистических текстах придает им не только типичные черты, но и выразительность.Языковые средства выразительности, используемые в военных публикациях, можно разделить на три группы: фонографические (аллитерация, ритм, морфологические и лексические повторы), лексические (эпитеты, метафора, обыгрывание фразеологизмов, жаргонизмы) и синтаксические (односоставные предложения, эмфатические конструкции, инверсия, антитеза, прямая речь, цитата), основной функцией которых является информирование, привлечение внимания, влияние на читателя, внедрение в его подсознание определенных психологических установок. Наиболее распространенными стилистическими тропами, используемыми в рассмотренных в рамках данной работы военных журналах, оказались односоставные предложения, эмфатические и параллельные конструкции, цитаты и прямая речь, метафоры, аллитерация, рифма и ритм.Заключение. В данной работе впервые были проанализированы особенности применения языковых средств выразительности в современных англоязычных военных публикациях. Результаты проведенного исследования могут быть практически применимы как для дальнейшего теоретического изучения рассматриваемой проблемы, так и практически для повышения качества иноязычного образования курсантов и слушателей военных образовательных учреждений в рамках как основной программы подготовки, так и в ходе обучения на курсах военных переводчиков по программе дополнительного профессионального образования.
 Introduction. On the basis of a linguo-stylistic analysis of articles from English-language military journals, the authors study the language means of expressiveness of military publications, a deep knowledge of which allows the reader to understand not only the informative, but also the emotional element of their content.The aim of the work is to describe the variety and features of the use of linguistic means of expressiveness in modern English-language military publications.Material and methods. The authors studied dissertations and scientific articles in periodicals on the philology of Germanic languages over the past 10 years, as well as publications in such English-language military journals as Air Force News, Australian Defense Force Journal, Canadian Military Journal, Defense Turkey, Raider, covering the activities and state of the armed forces of Great Britain, the United States, Australia, Turkey, Canada and other states. General scientific methods of theoretical analysis, observation, generalization, and concretization are used. Results and discussion. A review of publications on the philology of Germanic languages over the past decade confirms the insufficient knowledge of the problems of the use of language means of expressiveness in English-language military publications and the relevance of conducting more in-depth research in this field of linguistics. Analysis of the content of English-language military journals indicates that military-political and scientific-technical styles dominate in articles of military orientation, although they also combine elements of artistic, conversational and advertising text, and the combination of elements of various functional styles in journalistic texts gives them not only typical features, but also expressiveness. The language means of expressiveness used in military publications can be divided into three groups: phonographic (alliteration, rhythm, morphological and lexical repetitions), lexical (epithets, metaphor, playing phraseological units, jargon) and syntactic (one-part sentences, emphatic constructions, inversion, antithesis, direct speech, quotation), the main function of which is to inform, attract attention, influence the reader, introduce certain psychological attitudes into his subconscious. Conclusion. In this paper, for the first time, the features of the use of language means of expressiveness in modern English-language military publications were analyzed. The results of the conducted research can be practically applied both for further theoretical study of the problem under consideration, and practically for improving the quality of foreign language education of cadets and students of military educational institutions within the framework of both the main training program and during training at military translators ‘ courses under the program of additional professional education.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f89d34dba265a4e3626f0b9f0e0741c25793fd8,3f89d34dba265a4e3626f0b9f0e0741c25793fd8,"[{'authorId': '2151296065', 'name': 'Наталья Евгеньевна Селезнева'}, {'authorId': '2151299228', 'name': 'Ольга Владимировна Барская'}]"
94 st Annual Meeting of the Eastern Society of the Seismological Society of America,"tragic collapse of the Champlain South Condominium Tower in Surfside, Florida, motivated examining building’s stability and coastal subsidence using space-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). The 2016-2021 Sentinel-1 InSAR data of the towns of Surfside and Bal Harbour in Miami Beach, FL, reveals several subsidence hotspots, including the Surf Club hotel, Oceana, and 87 Park Tower, where construction was completed in 2016, 2016, and 2019, respectively. The subsidence of up to 100 mm over several years following the construction is centered in newly constructed high-rise buildings. For the Surf Club hotel, there was ~40 mm/yr subsidence in radar line-of-sight direction until early 2018, when it leveled out. The temporal correlation of subsidence with nearby construction suggests that the subsidence could be related to the construction of the foundation (e.g., vibration activities). Another building constructed 500 meters north of the Surf Club hotel in 2016 does not show any subsidence. For the Oceana, subsidence continues as of 2022. InSAR data also shows 20 mm of subsidence for the 87 Park Tower, nearby the collapse location. The geotechnical report from 87 Park Tower construction shows interbedded sand layers within the limestone. Therefore, we hypothesize that the subsidence is caused by creep and/or dynamic settlement of these interbedded sand layers. The next steps are to obtain and use the geotechnical reports from the construction of the buildings to compare the underlying soil strata condition to shed light on the lithology of these sites and information on vibration activities. With this information, we will investigate the coupled effect of creep due to sustained loading by new buildings and dynamic settlement from vibrations to explain the diversity in the InSAR signal. Previous research has linked earthflow-earthspread deposits within parts of Gouffre Valley, southern Quebec, to failures triggered by the AD 1663 M 7.5±0.45 Charlevoix earthquake, demonstrating a close connection between landsliding and strong earthquake shaking. This study examined the distribution, stratigraphy, and chronology of the landslide deposits within the greater valley to provide a long-term context for the AD 1663 earthquake. Our mapping utilized a 1x1 m digital terrain model, and we interpreted deposit age and stratigraphy from 23 new AMS radiocarbon ages, supplemented by 49 regular radiocarbon ages and 23 dendrochronology ages compiled from previous studies. These data provide a robust connection between the AD 1663 earthquake and large-scale landslide deposits that extend along about 20 km of the valley bottom and originated from separate source areas. Eight, relatively small-scale, prehistoric landslide features are also present in Gouffre Valley, including three deposits aged between about 7950-7300, 6595-6087, and 1310-1210 cal BC, a poorly constrained deposit aged between 4782-4452 cal BC and AD 1663, three undated landslides, and an undated amphitheatre-shaped landslide source area. There is no evidence to support an earthquake trigger for any of these pre-AD 1663 landslides. Instead, the widespread deposits associated with the AD 1663 earthquake represent the only multi-event, landslide signature in Gouffre Valley. This, in combination with a long gap between early postglacial The sharp increase in earthquakes in the Central and Eastern United States over the past decade has primarily been attributed to large volume fluid injection associated with enhanced oil and gas recovery. In this presentation, we will provide an overview of the findings from various studies characterizing human-induced seismicity across the region with comparisons to tectonic seismicity. The majority of induced seismicity and the largest magnitude earthquakes have been the result of disposal of produced and flowback water, but there has also been a prominent amount of seismicity caused directly by hydraulic fracture stimulations. Proximity of fluid injection to mature faults optimally oriented in the stress field appears to be a key ingredient for generating seismicity. However, fault identification can be difficult prior to injection, particularly in the predominantly strike-slip settings. Observational studies point to the injection flux (volume per area per time) being a key factor raising the likelihood of induced seismicity. This is supported by modeling studies that identify the seismicity rate being driven by the rate of change in pore fluid pressure. These findings provide some guidance in terms of best practices for mitigating the hazard via regulatory and operational strategies, but ultimately broader integration with geomechanical, hydrological, and structural datasets will be necessary. It will be important to continue to learn lessons from the ongoing large-scale fluid injection “experiment” to better understand the hazards associated with even larger volume injection that will be necessary to make carbon sequestration economically viable. The Mexican subduction zone is considered a natural laboratory for studying slip processes due to the relatively short ( ∼ 50 km) trench-to-coast Earthquake shear waves can become trapped between the free surface and high-impedance basal layers resulting in additional amplification at specific frequencies. This shear-wave-resonance phenomenon is a primary concern for mitigating ground-motion site response. The standard approach to quantifying resonance-dominated site response involves 1D analyses that require detailed velocity models. Thus, developing one or more simple and reliable proxies to quantify site resonance is desirable. We evaluated the relationship between impedance ratios determined from site shear-wave velocity profiles and the fundamental and peak resonance frequencies and amplifications at 43 seismic stations in the central and eastern U.S. The impedance ratios were calculated as the ratio of the impedance of the base layer to the average impedance of the overlying layers. We found that the depths to bedrock and to the maximum impedance ratios most skillfully predict the frequencies of the first and peak modes, respectively, determined from 1D linear response analyses. Also, we found that theoretical 1D fundamental-mode amplifications are well predicted by bedrock-to-average-sediment impedance ratios and that maximum impedance ratios best predict peak theoretical amplifications. Preliminary The 1886 magnitude ~7 Summerville, South Carolina earthquake was the largest recorded on the east coast of the United States. A better understanding of this earthquake would allow for better evaluation of the intraplate seismic hazard in this region. However, due to a lack of seismic observations from the time and lack of distinctive surface rupture, the fault structure remains unclear. A previous study based on results from a 2011-2012 deployment of seismometers has suggested a south-striking west-dipping zone of modern seismicity in the region which is contended by other geophysical studies. Starting in May 2021, a temporary 19-station short-period network was deployed in the Summerville region. We use the network to identify more events and better interpret the spatial variations in microseismicity in the region. Starting with 52 template events, including two magnitude ~3 events on September 27, 2021, we perform a matched filter detection with the one year of continuous data from this deployment along with data from four permanent stations, resulting in over 170 total event detections. We then determine precise relative locations of a portion of these events using differential travel-time relocation methods and compare the results with that of the previous 2011-2012 deployment. The best relocation method returned a relocate catalog of 164 events. We also determine focal mechanism solutions for three events from September 27, 2021 with magnitudes 2.0, 3.1, and 3.3 and infer their fault planes from the relocation results. Our preliminary results also illuminate a south-striking west-dipping zone in the southern seismicity cluster, which is consistent with the thrust focal mechanism of the magnitude 3.3 earthquake on September 27, 2021. In comparison, the northern seismicity cluster likely occurs on a north-south striking right-lateral strike-slip fault, consistent with previous results and complex patterns of stress and faulting expected in the region. The Western Québec Seismic Zone (WQSZ) is one of the most active seismic zones in eastern Canada that encloses the Ottawa Valley from Montréal to Témiscaming and from Cornwall up along the Laurentian Mountains. Although the WQSZ has historically experienced earthquakes as large as the 1935 M 6.2 Témiscaming earthquake, detailed, high-resolution earthquake source parameters and a comprehensive active fault database are not yet available. In this study, we first perform an automatic earthquake phase detection based on a multi-task deep neural network and associate events by the phase pick number as well as travel time residual. Next, we use a least-square maximum likelihood location method to determine the initial event locations followed by the double-difference (DD) relocation. Our results successfully enhance the Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) catalog from ~200 events to ~1500 events in a nearly four years period that provide adequate station distribution (the United States transportable seismic array from 2013 to 2015, Canadian seismic array from 2020 to 2022) in the Greater Montréal area.

"Litigants in Person: Principles and Practice in Civil and Family Matters in Singapore by Jaclyn L Neo & Helena Whalen-Bridge Singapore: SAL Academy Publishing, 2021. 177 pp. Hardcover: S$64.20","The ‘multiple distinctive challenges’ that litigants in person (LiPs) ‘present to the legal system’ (p 12), will be an issue that will resonate with anyone interested in civil justice across the common law world. This concise volume, focusing on the issues from Singapore’s perspective, is a welcome and valuable addition to the literature. It draws on multiple data sources – official data, case law, interviews, and a survey – to explore ‘the challenges that a lack of representation poses to the wider justice process’ (p 12). While the issue at the centre of the book is framed as a ‘lack of representation’, the considered solutions offered in the final chapter include systemic changes to make the system more accessible to unrepresented litigants. Commendably, the book presents a nuanced understanding of LiPs, noting the tendency of many legal actors to characterise LiPs as ‘“difficult”, “trouble-making”, “obsessive”, and even “vexatious”’ (p 17). The book contains a comprehensive review of the position of LiPs in four common law jurisdictions – the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States – and compares these to the situation in Singapore (Chapter 2). In conducting this review, the authors make the astute observation that discussion about LiPs has been influenced by particular foci in these jurisdictions, for example in the United Kingdom the changes to the legal aid system and in the United States, the concern with the legal needs of low-income Americans (p 12). This discussion might have been enriched by including Canada, which has detailed research on LiPs and relevant case law. For example, in Pintea v Johns, the Canadian Supreme Court endorsed the ‘Statement of Principles on Self-Represented Litigants and Accused Persons’, a document that provides guidance to judges, court administrators, and lawyers, ‘to ensure that self-represented persons are provided with fair access and equal treatment by the court’. Nevertheless, it will be very useful to anyone seeking a quality comparative survey of the issues. The authors go beyond policy and academic papers in their review; also analysing annual reports and other official materials to estimate numbers of LiPs in various Singapore jurisdictions (Chapter 2). This is useful data, which is interpreted with the appropriate caution that such records require, and provides at least a partial picture of LiP activity in Singapore courts. Hopefully such data will motivate the relevant bodies to heed the authors’ call for ‘coordinated and sustained data collection’ to",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/053b4a339ad0e2179e0716a4ee8c33832ff916d5,053b4a339ad0e2179e0716a4ee8c33832ff916d5,"[{'authorId': '1414215850', 'name': 'Bridgette Toy-Cronin'}]"
Ontogeny of Uterine Gland Development in the Neonatal Dog,"Ovine models suggest that administration of progesterone during neonatal life can permanently inhibit uterine gland development and cause infertility in the adult animal. Although extensive information is available on uterine gland development in other species, postnatal uterine development and uterine gland ontogeny in the dog has not been studied. The goal of this study was to evaluate neonatal canine uterine development and uterine gland ontogeny to identify the most efficacious window for neonatal/juvenile administration of progesterone as a contraceptive method in the dog. Neonatal canine uteri at 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56 days of age postnatal (n = 3 for all ages except 6 weeks, where n = 2) were evaluated by morphometric methods and Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate proliferation in both epithelial and stromal compartments. Initiation of uterine gland development began around day 7, with epithelial cells beginning to bud off from the uterine luminal epithelium. Both luminal epithelial and stromal cells were proliferating rapidly, with a Ki-67 labeling index (LI) of 36.8% ± 5.8% and 19.2% ± 4.9%, respectively at day 7. At 14 days, glands were clearly identifiable, and proliferation of luminal, glandular and stromal cells remained active (LI= 30.3% ± 4.8%, 45.4% ± 3.7% and 14.4% ± 1.4%, respectively). By day 28, glands had invaded further into the stroma, although proliferative activity had decreased in all cell compartments (LI= 9.5% ± 0.6%, 16.0% ± 1.5% and 2.2% ± 0.5% in luminal, glandular and stromal cells respectively). By days 42 to 56, uterine gland development was more extensive than at day 28, although the amount of gland development was substantially less than seen in the dog at Inhalation of fungal spores is the means of contracting several fungal diseases of importance in humans and animals. Thousands of fungal spores are deposited onto the surfactant-lining layer of pulmonary alveoli during the course of daily life. The Surfactant Protein A (SP-A) is a calcium-dependent innate immunity protein that enhances the clearance of microbial pathogens from the lung by opsonization and membrane permeabilization. Little is known about SP-A/fungal interactions. A yeast deletion library was used to identify fungal factors that interact with SP-A. A library consisting of approximately 5,000 yeast deletion mutants was screened for their susceptibility to aggregation and killing by SP-A. Pools of yeast mutants were grown and replicated in 96-well microtiter plates and exposed to 50 microgram/ml SP-A in aggregation buffer. Yeast aggregation was scored by visual observation using an inverted light microscope. Aggregated yeast mutants were LIVE/DEAD stained to determine the extent of killing by SP-A. The homologs of these fungal targets will be identified by bioinformatics using genome sequences of pulmonary fungal pathogens. Immunohistochemistry was also performed to determine the relationship between SP-A and fungal infection. Paraffin-embedded lungs of birds and companion animals with known fungal infections were sectioned and stained for SP-A using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to determine SP-A levels. We hypothesize that fungal infection will decrease SP-A levels in the affected lungs and that deletion of fungal targets in pathogenic fungi will attenuate their virulence in the lungs. The opportunistic fungus Candida albicans causes various forms of disease including disseminated disease, most commonly associated with immunocompromised patients, and superficial, mucosal disease that can affect immunocompromised or normally healthy individuals. C. albicans PIR1 encodes a protein associated with beta-1,3-glucan in the C. albicans cell wall. Published studies suggested that Pir1 is required for proper cell wall architecture and that PIR1 is an essential gene. Our work suggested that Pir1 might contribute to adhesive interactions between C. albicans and mammalian cells. Contrary to literature predictions, we constructed a viable pir1/pir1 mutant strain. The phenotype of the strain was compared to wild-type and reintegrant control strains for growth rate, cellular morphology, germ tube formation, sensitivity to compounds that interfere with polymerization of cell wall components, and adhesion to cultured vascular endothelial cells and freshly collected buccal epithelial cells. PIR1 allelic variation was also studied. Many genes encoding C. albicans cell wall proteins have considerable allelic variability, often arising from regions of repeated sequences. Based on differences between the PIR1 alleles from strain SC5314, we developed a PCR assay and assessed allelic variability in collections of diverse C. albicans isolates from humans and wildlife. Strains passaged for many generations in vitro or in vivo were used to assess stability of the repeated sequences within PIR1 alleles. The C. albicans cell wall provides fungal cell integrity and is a structure not present in mammalian host cells. As such, the cell wall is an important antifungal drug target and its study is significant. Student Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) is an insect-transmitted Orbivirus infecting ruminants and white-tailed deer. EHDV outbreaks occurred in 2007 in U.S. white-tailed deer populations, including those in Illinois. The purpose of this study was to determine the genotype of an EHDV isolate from the 2007 outbreak. EHDV contains 10 segments of double-stranded RNA that code for seven viral proteins and three non-structural proteins. Of these proteins, the major neutralizing antigen protein VP2 and the major structural protein VP3 were selected for genotyping. EHDV was grown in HeLa cells and the viral genomic RNA was purified. RT-PCR was used to reverse transcribe and amplify gene segments from VP2 and VP3. DNA sequences of the gene segments were compared to those from EHDV isolates available in GenBank. Comparison of VP2 gene segments representing positions 1318-1644 (327bp), 1716-2075 (360bp), and 2384-2873 (490bp) showed 97%, 95%, and 96% amino acid sequence identity, respectively, with EHDV sequences from an serotype-2 isolate from Alberta, Canada. Comparison of VP3 gene segment representing position 1654-2670 (1017bp) with an Alberta isolate showed 100% identity. These preliminary data suggest the 2007 outbreaks in the U.S. were most likely attributed to the EHDV serotype-2 strain common in North America. Completion of the VP2 and VP3 sequences will allow a more comprehensive analysis. Given the limited availability of EHDV sequences, information from this work will aid in identifying the source of future EHDV outbreaks. is initiated when the embryo attaches to the uterine luminal epithelium during early pregnancy, triggering the transformation of uterine stromal cells to decidual cells in a process tightly coordinated by estrogen (E) and progesterone (P). Recent studies have shown that the intra-uterine biosynthesis of local E via induction of P450 aromatase is critical to sustain pregnancy in addition to the ovarian source of P. Plausible candidates involved in regulating aromatase expression in the decidual uterus include members of the monomeric orphan nuclear receptor family, which are key aromatase transcription regulators in other E-producing tissues. Liver-receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) were the two major factors studied with an overall aim to identify the specific molecule expressed during decidualization. Uterine stromal cells from pregnant mice were isolated during days 3 -7 of pregnancy. RNA was isolated and subjected to cDNA preparation. Expression patterns of LRH-1 and SF1 were monitored via q-PCR analysis, and protein expression during pregnancy was identified via immunolocalization using an antibody against the specific protein. Expression of decidualization markers like alkaline phosphatase, prolactin-related peptide, and aromatase was also analyzed. A significant induction of LRH-1 in the isolated stromal cell population was observed, however, the expression of SF1 was not markedly induced. LRH-1 may be the transcription factor of interest that up-regulates aromatase expression in uterine stromal cells during implantation and decidualization. Future experiments should determine expression profiles in ovariectomized virgin mice to understand if the regulation of aromatase is specific to differentiating stromal cells. Caspase-3 is a critical executioner enzyme in apoptosis that exists intracellularly as the proenzyme procaspase-3. In cancer cells, abnormal expression of proteins in apoptotic pathways prevents the activation of procaspase-3 to caspase-3, thus preventing apoptosis. Since procaspase-3 is often upregulated in cancer, determine the importance of drug concentration versus exposure time for cytotoxicity, IC50s of PAC-1-II-9 were completed using a sulfhorodamine B assay for times ranging from 1 to 72 hours and compared to those of PAC-1, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel. Results showed that PAC-1-II-9 was dependent upon both exposure time and concentration for cytotoxicity. The pharmacokinetics of 150 mg/kg subcutaneous injections of PAC-1-II-9 maintained a therapeutic concentration for two hours. Blood samples were taken at time points between 10 minutes and 1 day post-injection and analyzed via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Determining the dependence of PAC-1-II-9 on exposure time and concentration, and determining its pharmacokinetics in vivo are important precursors to testing the efficacy of PAC-1-II-9 against cancer in vivo.

Repatriation of Indigenous Peoples’ Cultural Property: Could Alternative Dispute Resolution Be a Solution? Lessons Learned from the G’psgolox Totem Pole and the Maaso Kova Case,"Considering that the vast majority of the objects constituting Indigenous Peoples’ cultural heritage are now located outside their source communities, the restitution of cultural property has become a pressing issue among Indigenous Peoples worldwide and should be understood as part of Indigenous Peoples’ historical (as well as current) encounter with colonization and its consequences. As such, this article investigates whether international cultural heritage law offers any possibilities for successful repatriation and to what extent the shortcomings of the framework in place could be complemented by alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms and the new mandate of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (Expert Mechanism). First, crucial concepts in the repatriation debates are explained. Next the factual background of the case studies of the G’psgolox Totem Pole and Maaso Kova are presented. This is followed by a discussion of the most pertinent mechanisms of international cultural heritage law and the place of Indigenous Peoples’ rights within such a framework. Subsequently, the concept of ADR is introduced, and the details of the negotiation processes between the Haisla First Nation (Canada) and the Yaqui People (Mexico, the United States) – both with the Museum of Ethnography in Stockholm (Sweden) – are presented. Finally, the article evaluates to what extent ADR could be an appropriate mechanism for the settlement of disputes concerningIndigenous Peoples’ cultural property, andwhether the Expert Mechanism is a well-suited body for facilitating the process of repatriating Indigenous Peoples’ cultural heritage.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2458bc643029b0881bb6f1561d8f21ad5f07db40,2458bc643029b0881bb6f1561d8f21ad5f07db40,"[{'authorId': '2201216030', 'name': 'Karolina Prażmowska-Marcinowska'}]"
A Research on Regionalization under the WTO SPS Agreement,"The World Trade Organization (hereinafter, WTO) Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (hereinafter, SPS Agreement) is the first multilateral agreement which elaborates on the principles of Article XX(b) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994. The SPS Agreement aims to protect human, animal or plant life or health, and prevent those SPS measures from discriminating arbitrarily between the WTO members. 
Especially, it is important to understand the Adaptation to Regional Conditions (hereinafter, Regionalization) of Article 6 under the SPS Agreement, as WTO Appellate Body in the Russia-Pigs Dispute examined the implementation aspects of Article 6.2 under the SPS Agreement. The Appellate Body reversed its previous rulings on Article 6.2 in the India-Agricultural Products Dispute, the US-Animals Dispute, and the Russia-Pigs Dispute, and highlighted the implementation aspects of the 'Regionalization Procedure', for the first time. In addition, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) in the US-Animals Dispute and the Russia-Pigs Dispute pinpointed the relationship between the 'Import Approval Procedure' under Article 8 and Annex C, and the 'Regionalization Procedure' under the Article 6 of the SPS Agreement. Thus, this research focuses on the WTO Adjudications on Regionalization of Article 6, and its extended interpretations to the 'Import Approval Procedure' of Article 8 and Annex C of the SPS Agreement. It continues to study on the Regionalization provisions within the United States, European Union, and the Republic of Korea. Also, it analyzes and compares on the legal obligations of Regionalization provisions under the preferential trade agreements, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (hereinafter, CPTPP), the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (hereinafter, RCEP), and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (hereinafter, USMCA). It mainly compares CPTPP and RCEP, or CPTPP and USMCA. The main purpose of this analysis is to comprehend the contents and the level of legal obligations of CPTPP, and find legal improvements for the domestic regulations of the Republic of Korea after its accession to CPTPP. In the same vein, this research emphasizes on the significance of the WTO Adjudications and its implications to be reflected on the domestic regulations. 
The Republic of Korea needs to organize a systematic framework for dealing with the Regionalization requests from foreign governments, and establish an official position who specializes in the 'Regionalization Procedure'. This research will provide implications for the improvement of the legal and administrative framework of the Republic of Korea.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5fc17a50ca3b76470fd1801f40b00b766d401be3,5fc17a50ca3b76470fd1801f40b00b766d401be3,"[{'authorId': '2109871643', 'name': 'Hyun-jung Kim'}]"

Burden of kidney disease and the burden of proof,"End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) continues to be a worldwide problem, with an increasing number of patients undergoing kidney replacement therapy. Kidney failure has a negative impact on patients’ quality of life. Kidney failure affects all aspects of life, including the ability to work, social functioning, physical activity, overall well-being and life satisfaction. As the benefits and disadvantages of different dialysis modalities continue to be debated among kidney care practitioners, it is important to evaluate and understand the impact of each modality on quality of life. In the past few years, we have witnessed the kidney care community moving towards patient-centred treatments, de-emphasising clearance targets or length of survival, as reflected in the latest International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis guidelines for delivering high-quality peritoneal dialysis (PD). In this issue of Peritoneal Dialysis International (PDI), Li et al. report the results of a randomised controlled study that aimed to evaluate the impact of dialysis modality (in-centre haemodialysis (HD) and PD) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Seven hundred and twenty-five patients with ESKD across 36 dialysis centres in China were randomised to either in-centre HD or PD. Patients completed the HRQoL survey (Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form (KDQOL-SF)) after 48 weeks. The focus was on the ‘burden of kidney disease’ domain, assessed by four parameters reflecting the degree of interference of kidney disease on patients’ lives. The study was structured statistically as a non-inferiority analysis of PD compared to HD. The change in ‘burden of kidney disease’ from baseline to 48 weeks after randomisation was similar between study groups and satisfied non-inferiority for PD. Patients receiving PD had more adverse events leading to hospitalisations and serious adverse events. PD patients also had more gastrointestinal problems and hypokalaemia. As a secondary outcome in this trial, mortality was lower among PD patients versus in-centre HD in the intention to treat analysis. The authors concluded that PD is non-inferior to HD in the ‘burden of kidney disease’ scale after 48 months. When considering the generalisability of the results to other patient populations, the baseline characteristics of the study population deserve comment. The study cohort consisted of relatively younger Chinese patients with less comorbidity than what is seen in many other analyses. The mean age of the cohort was 49.8 years, only 16.3% had a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 27.8% had diabetes. Contrast this cohort to the 2021 annual report of the United States Renal Data System where the mean age of incident ESKD patients is 62.7 years, 66.2% had CVD and 60.6% had diabetes. According to the UK Renal Registry, the median age of patients starting kidney replacement therapy was 64.2 years, and 30.4% had diabetes as the primary cause of kidney disease. Generalisability is further challenged by the observation that only 3.5% of the participants were on automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), and none were using icodextrin. This is very different from PD practice in many high-income countries. Patients from Australia/New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States use APD predominantly, with rates ranging between 66% in Australia/New Zealand and 83% in the United States. Icodextrin is used by more than 40% of patients in Australia/New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan and 15% of patients in the United States. Li et al. report a higher proportion of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to hospitalisations in patients receiving PD compared to in-centre HD. However, the details of those adverse events are not specified. With regard to infectious complications, the proportion of infections was higher in the PD arm (largely driven by peritonitis), however, infectious event rates, infection-related morbidity and infections by access type are not provided.

"Noccaea klimesii (Coluteocarpeae; Brassicaceae), a new species from Ladakh, India","Noccaea Moench (1802: 89) is a large genus the vast majority of its species were originally described in Thlaspi Linnaeus (1753: 645). Meyer (1973) divided the latter genus into 12 segregates, including Noccaea, to which he placed 67 Eurasian and NW African species in four sections (Meyer: 2006). Experts on the Brassicaceae differ in the delimitation of Noccaea and some (e.g., Al-Shehbaz: 2014; Firat et al.: 2014; Güzel et al.: 2018; Özgişi et al.: 2018a, 2018b; Özüdoğru: 2018; Özüdoğru et al.: 2019; Özgişi: 2020a, 2020b) broadly delimit the genus to include most of Meyer’s dozen segregates and accept some 136 species, including the more recent novelties and nomenclatural adjustments by Bartolucii, Galasso & Peruzzi in Peruzzi et al. (2015), German (2016: 2017, 2018), Güzel et al. (2018), Özgişi et al. (2018b), and Özüdoğru et al. (2019). By contrast, a narrower generic concept for Noccaea was recognized in BrassiBase (https://brassibase.cos.uni-heidelberg.de/), Ali et al. (2016), and Karaismailoğlu & Erol (2018). As currently delimited, all except six species of Noccaea are Eurasian. Two species are endemic to the United States and one each in Algeria, Mexico, Patagonian South America, and Arctic Canada and Alaska (Al-Shehbaz: 2014).",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f276ab202bbc886a8f35d0fc306cf2e669cd6df,5f276ab202bbc886a8f35d0fc306cf2e669cd6df,"[{'authorId': '1393631754', 'name': 'I.

Rapid Web-Based Recruitment of Patients With Psoriasis: Multinational Cohort Study,"Background Wide-ranging patient recruitment not restricted to the location of the investigator will provide a better representation of the patient population in clinical studies. Objective Our goal was to assess the feasibility of a broad web-based recruitment strategy in an 8-week observational study of 500 study participants with psoriasis and healthy controls from locations remote from the investigator and to assess the cost associated with each participant. Methods A decentralized team in Denmark recruited patients with psoriasis and healthy controls using Google and Facebook advertisements and posts to Facebook groups. All individuals were screened via the internet, and patients diagnosed with psoriasis were included. Questionnaires regarding itch and sleep were completed by both groups at inclusion, week 4, and week 8. Results During a 2-week recruitment period, 12,887 unique advertisement views were registered, and 839 participants were enrolled, of which 507 completed the study (220 with psoriasis and 287 healthy controls) with a retention rate of 60.4%. Participants were recruited from 11 different countries on 4 separate continents, mainly from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The recruitment rate was 59.9 participants per day, and the conversion rate was 57.2%. Recruitment costs were US $13 per enrolled participant and US $22 per participant completing the study. Conclusions It is feasible and rapid to recruit a large number of participants from locations different from the investigator and to retain patients in an observational study with no visits to a clinical site at low costs.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/726855f37a20035720e167ae465dd4105b3bd184,726855f37a20035720e167ae465dd4105b3bd184,"[{'authorId': '2223892882', 'name': 'Zacharias Duus Holm'}, {'authorId': '38063475', 'name': 'J.
