Temporal assessment of entomological surveillance of Trypanosoma cruzi vectors in an endemic area of northeastern Brazil,"Entomological surveillance is essential for the control of triatomines and the prevention of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in humans and domestic animals. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate entomological indicators and triatomine control during the period from 2005 to 2015 in an endemic area in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. This observational and retrospective study was developed based on data analysis related to active entomological surveillance activities and chemical control of infested housing units (HU) in the Agreste mesoregion of the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, in the period between 2005 to 2015. The quantitative analysis of housing units surveyed for entomological indicators was performed by linear regression of random effects (p < 0.05). The effect of the number of HU surveyed on the entomological indicators was analyzed by fitting a linear random effects regression model and an increasing intradomiciliary colonization rate was significant. In the period evaluated 92,156 housing units were investigated and the presence of triatomines was reported in 4,639 (5.0%). A total of 4,653 specimens of triatomines were captured and the species recorded were Triatoma pseudomaculata (n = 1,775), Triatoma brasiliensis (n = 1,569), Rhodnius nasutus (n = 741) and Panstrongylus lutzi (n = 568), with an index of natural infection by T. cruzi of 2.2%. Only 53.1% of the infested HU were subjected to chemical control. Moreover, there was a decrease in the total number of HU surveyed over time associated with an increase in the index of intradomiciliary colonization (p = 0.004). These data demonstrated that entomological surveillance and control of vectors in the Agreste mesoregion of the state has been discontinued, emphasizing the need for more effective public policies to effectively control the vectors, in order to avoid the exposure of humans and domestic animals to the risk of T. cruzi infection.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0b22db4bf7e5405876a9dc9d13acee459e07a0d,b0b22db4bf7e5405876a9dc9d13acee459e07a0d,"George Harisson Felinto Sampaio, Andressa Noronha Barbosa da Silva, Christiane Carlos Araújo de Negreiros, Nathan Ravi Medeiros Honorato, R.

Antimicrobial activity of NK cells to Trypanosoma cruzi infected human primary Keratinocytes,"Infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is causative for Chagas disease, which is a highly neglected tropical disease prevalent in Latin America. Humans are primary infected through vectorial transmission by blood-sucking triatomine bugs. The parasite enters the human host through mucous membranes or small skin lesions. Since keratinocytes are the predominant cell type in the epidermis, they play a critical role in detecting disruptions in homeostasis and aiding in pathogen elimination by the immune system in the human skin as alternative antigen-presenting cells. Interestingly, keratinocytes also act as a reservoir for T. cruzi, as the skin has been identified as a major site of persistent infection in mice with chronic Chagas disease. Moreover, there are reports of the emergence of T. cruzi amastigote nests in the skin of immunocompromised individuals who are experiencing reactivation of Chagas disease. This observation implies that the skin may serve as a site for persistent parasite presence during chronic human infection too and underscores the significance of investigating the interactions between T. cruzi and skin cells. Consequently, the primary objective of this study was to establish and characterize the infection kinetics in human primary epidermal keratinocytes (hPEK). Our investigation focused on surface molecules that either facilitated or hindered the activation of natural killer (NK) cells, which play a crucial role in controlling the infection. To simulate the in vivo situation in humans, an autologous co-culture model was developed to examine the interactions between T. cruzi infected keratinocytes and NK cells. We evaluated the degranulation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity of NK cells in response to the infected keratinocytes. We observed a strong activation of NK cells by infected keratinocytes, despite minimal alterations in the expression of activating or inhibitory ligands on NK cell receptors. However, stimulation with recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a cytokine known to be present in significant quantities during chronic T. cruzi infections in the host, resulted in a substantial upregulation of these ligands on primary keratinocytes. Overall, our findings suggest the crucial role of NK cells in controlling acute T. cruzi infection in the upper layer of the skin and shed light on keratinocytes as potential initial targets of infection.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6718100b49652b56fd9e0057096369ebf7896ca6,6718100b49652b56fd9e0057096369ebf7896ca6,"Keshia Kroh, J.

The distribution of triatomine (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in Illinois and Missouri: historical records and specimen submissions from community science programs.,"Triatomine species (kissing bugs) infected with Trypanosoma cruzi are found across the southern United States. The northern limits of Trypanosoma cruzi infected kissing bugs are less understood. The objective of this work was to describe the locations of kissing bugs from Illinois and Missouri based on historical records, submissions to Texas A&M University's (TAMU) Kissing Bug Community Science Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and records from online platforms (iNaturalist, BugGuide, and GBIF) up to and including 2022. A total of 228 records were discovered, including 186 from historical or observation platforms and 42 specimens submitted to TAMU or CDC. Species included Triatoma sanguisuga (221 total records, 9 nymphs) and Triatoma lecticularia (7 records). Notably, nearly all (24/26) records submitted to TAMU were collected indoors. Twelve of the 30 (40%) specimens tested were positive for the presence of T. cruzi, including parasite discrete taxonomic units TcI and TcIV. One triatomine sample had been found in a bed feeding on the submitter; this bug was positive for T. cruzi and had evidence of human blood in its gut. Records suggest a ubiquitous distribution in Missouri and potentially to the northernmost border in Illinois. Further investigations into triatomine distribution and infection status are needed within states assumed to be northern limits in order to create public health and veterinary health messaging and baseline distributional maps from which to measure future range shifts in relation to a changing climate.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26c765439f3ffb2a1f84d0a00d82100d54b09b8f,26c765439f3ffb2a1f84d0a00d82100d54b09b8f,"Ellen M.
