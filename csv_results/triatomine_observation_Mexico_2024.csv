"Life history data of a Triatoma protracta nahuatlae, T. sinaloensis, and their laboratory hybrids (Hemiptera: Reduviidae)","Chagas disease is one of the most significant vector-borne diseases in Mexico. The presence of “sylvatic” triatomine vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas) inside human dwellings necessitates estimating their vectorial capacity. To estimate this capacity in Triatoma protracta nahuatlae (Ryckman), Triatoma sinaloensis (Ryckman), and their laboratory hybrids, 6 biological parameters were examined. Triatoma sinaloensis exhibited the shortest development time (155 days), with a median of 12 blood meals. Mortality rates varied from 35% to 45% in the 3 studied cohorts. All 3 cohorts were aggressive, initiating feeding within 0.5–1 min, and had similar feeding periods ranging from 10 to 18 min. A majority (75.3–97.9%) of the hybrids defecated when feeding, immediately after feeding, or in less than 1 min post-feeding. In contrast, only 7–42% of nymphs of T. sinaloensis defecated during the same period. Our results regarding the 6 parameters studied confirm the potential role of T. p. nahuatlae as an efficient vector of T. cruzi. Triatoma sinaloensis, on the other hand, exhibited limited vectorial capacity primarily due to its poor defecation behavior. Continued surveillance of these “sylvatic” triatomine populations is necessary to prevent an epidemiological problem.

Development and survival of Triatoma barberi and Triatoma longipennis (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) is affected by Trypanosoma cruzi colonization,"Triatomines are insect vectors of the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This occurs when the triatomine defecates on the skin of the vertebrate host when it bites its host for feeding. This lesion causes the penetration of T. cruzi, whose infective phase is the tripomastigote, and the non-infective replicative phase epimastigote. Although the effects of T. cruzi on the development and survival of different species of triatomine bugs are known, it has not been fully described how the parasite affects many of the species that inhabit Mexico. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of the presence of T. cruzi on triatomine development and survival. For this, five triatomines of each instar of each species, Triatoma barberi and Triatoma longipennis, were inoculated, from their second instar to their adult stage, female or male. Each triatomine was infected with 3-5 x105 parasites and they were incubated for 100 days and the kinetic of parasites in the feces and T. cruzi phases were recorded. The results showed that T. barberi and T. longipennis development was affected in all stages because of T. cruzi infection. It was greater for T. longipennis, both in its mortality, as well as time to molt in each phase.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4737194bacbbac08f5fa33cac2270f118caf1583,4737194bacbbac08f5fa33cac2270f118caf1583,"M.

"Novel finding of Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus (Champion, 1899) (Hemiptera, Reduviidae, Triatominae) in Belize, with a note on single Rhodnius Stål, 1859 species observations","We report Triatominae species Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus (Champion, 1899) for the first time in Belize. The specimen was collected in Cayo District, Belize in 2003 and later discovered in 2023 in a research collection. The distribution of P. rufotuberculatus spans Mexico to Argentina, and Belize lies within this range. This finding represents the fifth triatomine species reported in Belize, but only two species, Triatoma dimidata Latreille, 1811 and T. mopan Dorn et al., 2018, have been reported more than once. More research is needed to fully understand Triatominae biodiversity in Belize.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f8bc9061da092e0a3cb2499a6cf97f9a0c0f134f,f8bc9061da092e0a3cb2499a6cf97f9a0c0f134f,"Jennifer K.

First Report of Seropositivity to Trypanosoma cruzi in Mexican Afro-Descendants from Guerrero and Oaxaca States,"Mexican Afro-descendant is a population poorly studied in many aspects, between them the infectious diseases that they suffer. This population is mainly found in the country's Pacific (Oaxaca and Guerrero states) and Atlantic (Veracruz) coast. In these regions, a diversity of triatomine vectors of the Chagas disease is found. Also, all the genotypes of Trypanosoma cruzi DTUs have been reported. That is why the present study aimed to study the presence of antibodies against T. cruzi and cardiac pathology associated with the Chagas disease in the Mexican Afro-descendant population of Guerrero and Oaxaca. ELISA, Western blot, and recombinant antigen's ELISA were used to evaluate the seropositivity of these communities. Furthermore, an electrocardiographic study and evaluation of risk factors associated with T. cruzi infection in the Oaxaca and Guerrero populations were conducted. 26.77% of the analyzed population was positive for two serological tests. These percentages are higher than the previously reported for the mestizo population in similar studies. Electrocardiographic results showed cardiac disorder associated with the Chagas disease in the population. Also, risk factors were identified associated with the men's activities in the outdoor working areas.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf626ae0f6e8462081535724997c0c4bc60ad9a2,bf626ae0f6e8462081535724997c0c4bc60ad9a2,"B.

"Zoonotic Cycle of American Trypanosomiasis in an Endemic Region of the Argentine Chaco, Factors That Influenced a Paradigm Shift","Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis), is a highly complex zoonosis that is present throughout South America, Central America, and Mexico. The transmission of this disease is influenced by various factors, including human activities like deforestation and land use changes, which may have altered the natural transmission cycles and their connection to the environment. In this study conducted in the Argentine Chaco region, we examined the transmission dynamics of T. cruzi by collecting blood samples from wild and domestic animals, as well as triatomine bugs from human dwellings, across five sites of varying anthropic intervention. Samples were analyzed for T. cruzi infection via qPCR, and we additionally examined triatomines for bloodmeal analysis via NGS amplicon sequencing. Our analysis revealed a 15.3% infection rate among 20 wild species (n = 123) and no T. cruzi presence in 9 species of domestic animals (n = 1359) or collected triatomines via qPCR. Additionally, we found chicken (34.28%), human (21.59%), and goat (19.36%) as the predominant bloodmeal sources across all sites. These findings suggest that anthropic intervention and other variables analyzed may have directly impacted the spillover dynamics of T. cruzi’s sylvatic cycle and potentially reduced its prevalence in human habitats.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96959ff7353d9fdad3d89da017a17034ea6b2b30,96959ff7353d9fdad3d89da017a17034ea6b2b30,"Andrea Gómez-Bravo, Sebastián Cirignoli, D.

Life history data of four populations of Triatoma mexicana (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) from Central Mexico.,"Triatomine bugs are vectors for the Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas parasites, the etiological agent for Chagas disease. This study evaluated 6 epidemiologically significant behaviors (development time, number of blood meals required for molting to the next instar, mortality rate, aggressiveness, feeding duration, and defecation delay) across 4 populations of Triatoma mexicana Herrich-Schaeffer (Heteroptera: Reduviidae), a major T. cruzi vector in Central Mexico. We collected triatomines from areas characterized by high (HP), medium (MP), medium-high (MHP), and low (LP) prevalence of human T. cruzi infection. The MHP population had the shortest development time, <290 days. Both the HP and MP populations required the most blood meals to molt to the next instar, with a median of 13. Mortality rates varied across all populations, ranging from 44% to 52%. All of the tested populations showed aggressive behavior during feeding. All populations shared similar feeding durations, with most exceeding 13 min and increasing with each instar. Quick defecation, during feeding, immediately after or less than 1 min after feeding, was observed in most nymphs (78%-90%) from the MP and MHP populations and adults (74%-92%) from HP, MP, and MHP populations. Though most parameters suggest a low potential for T. mexicana to transmit T. cruzi, unique feeding and defecation behaviors in 3 populations (excluding the LP group) could elevate their epidemiological importance. These population-specific differences may contribute to the varying prevalence rates of T. cruzi infection in areas where T. mexicana is found.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77207a5daa25ea5d819c25818bea9adefa1a5619,77207a5daa25ea5d819c25818bea9adefa1a5619,"B.

Domestic Dog Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi from Northern and Southern Regions of Mexico.,"Background: Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and vectored by triatomines, affects millions of people worldwide. In endemic countries including Mexico, infections in domestic animals, such as dogs, may affect the risk of human disease when they serve as a source of infection to vectors that subsequently infect humans. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 296 dogs from two cities near the northern and southern borders of Mexico: Reynosa, Tamaulipas, and Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas. Infection was measured based on testing of blood using T. cruzi quantitative PCR (qPCR) and up to three antibody detection assays. The StatPak immunochromatographic assay was used to screen samples and the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) and multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MIA) tests were used as secondary tests on all samples that screened positive and a subset of negatives. Serologic positivity was defined based on reactivity on at least two independent tests. Results: Of the 280 samples tested for parasite DNA, two (0.7%) were positive, one of which (0.4%) was confirmed as T. cruzi discrete typing unit TcIV. Overall, 72 (24.3%) samples were reactive for T. cruzi antibodies via StatPak of which 8 were also positive using MIA and 2 were also positive using IFA (including one of the PCR-positive dogs). Overall, nine dogs (3.4%) met study criteria of positivity based on either/both serology or PCR tests. Positive dogs were found in both regions of Mexico; five (2.7%) from Reynosa and four (3.6%) from Tuxtla Gutierrez. We found no association between infection status and state of origin, sex, age group, breed group, neighborhood, and whether other pets lived in the home. Conclusion: Our results re-emphasize dogs' utility as sentinels for T. cruzi in Mexico and underscore the need for improved veterinary diagnostic tests and parasite surveillance at the household level in endemic countries.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9391f15fa5412f93ff430c0260f769620f0a630,e9391f15fa5412f93ff430c0260f769620f0a630,"Edward Davila, Nadia A Fernandez-Santos, J.
