"An Assemblage of Fleas (Siphonaptera) From Canada, México, and the United States of America, in the Hastriter Collecton (Brigham Young University)","ABSTRACT An accumulation of fleas that constitute the Hastriter flea collection includes accounts/records of 167 species over 48 years. These officially belong to the Brigham Young University flea collection. They are summarized in this treatise with identifications of new state, county, and provicincial records from the United States, Canada, and some species that extend south into México. Records included are represented by eight families that are presented in alphabetical order (Ceratophyllidae, Ctenopthalmidae, Hystrichopsyllidae, Ischnopsyllidae, Leptopsyllidae, Pulicidae, Rhopalopsyllidae, and Vermipsyllidae). Major synonomies are provided with each species (excluding very common and cosmopolitan species) with major political subdivisions following each reference/pagination. Two appendices are included that list important references (not included in synonomies) (Appendix I) and a listing of synonyms for the family Ceratophyllidae (Appendix II). Four tables are included that list new geographical records and one table that notes new host records. Seventy-eight flea species (some of the same species were new for different state, county and provincial records) accounted for 129 new U.S. state or Canadian provincial records. These also included 12 new state records. An additional 15 new host records for 13 different flea species were documented. To aid future investigations, significant research findings such as disease investigations, zoonotic disease control measures, seasonal bionomics, et cetera are annotated in the remarks.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/231653aa341f4da2e2aab1103e4f8e4c77e812a7,231653aa341f4da2e2aab1103e4f8e4c77e812a7,"[{'authorId': '5702199', 'name': 'M.

"Challenges in and Opportunities for International Collaboration: Costing Flood Damages and Losses across Canada, Mexico, and the United States","
Flooding, including inland and coastal flooding, is one of the most devastating and costly natural hazards in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Recent research conducted by an international team has focused on understanding the true and comprehensive economic costs of floods, with an eye towards addressing their impacts, allocating adequate resources for monitoring and preparedness, and building resilient communities. Flood-costing methods vary greatly among federal and sub-national jurisdictions across the three North American countries. Because the rigor and consistency of existing datasets across the three countries vary significantly, it is also difficult to determine the economic impacts of cross-border events. This paper aims to critically analyze the research methods used to conduct this trinational project and develop recommendations for enhancing impacts of such work in future. We discuss three major research barriers: gaps in knowledge and research capacity; differences in data collation and analysis methods across the three countries; and, linguistic barriers in working across disciplines and economic sectors. We also explore how the COVID-19 pandemic significantly added to these three barriers. We propose creation of new institutional mechanisms that can play a major role in developing comprehensive, consistent, and cohesive data gathering approaches in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/223974bc1daa69bcb2db7497a823004218efd906,223974bc1daa69bcb2db7497a823004218efd906,"[{'authorId': '15329479', 'name': 'Z.

"Review of terrestrial temporarily conserved areas in Canada, the United States, and Mexico","The establishment of protected areas is a cornerstone of conservation, but permanent protection could be inefficient or even impossible in some situations. We synthesized the literature on temporarily conserved areas (TCAs) across Canada, the United States, and Mexico. We used a comprehensive search string to retrieve peer‐reviewed articles published from 2000 to 2021 from the Web of Science. We identified 27 relevant peer‐reviewed articles that examined the potential benefits of TCAs in the study area, indicating TCA is a relatively understudied area of research in the peer‐reviewed literature. The TCA studies were highly clustered; 77% of studies focused on protecting a single life stage of migratory species and 61% of studies related to temporary conservation of breeding or staging habitats for migratory birds. Ninety‐three percent of studies focused on preventing human‐driven threats, mainly on public lands of coastal areas, the Great Plains, and the Mississippi Valley in the central United States. Short‐term and experimental studies were the dominant study types. TCAs have the potential to complement permanently protected areas and provide protection when permanent protection is difficult. Some included studies examined their conservation value, but the ecological, social, and economic outcomes of TCAs are unclear. More TCA research is needed to determine the role they could play in conservation worldwide. Embracing the concept of TCAs as conservation tool could lead to more comprehensive and consistent reporting of the outcomes of temporary area‐based conservation measures. However, a global review and analysis of effectiveness of TCAs will be required if they are to play a formal role in meeting international targets for biodiversity conservation.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b45f6009347dea1aab7f2a21fa208d3e204620af,b45f6009347dea1aab7f2a21fa208d3e204620af,"[{'authorId': '2205550154', 'name': 'Xin Wen'}, {'authorId': '100906556', 'name': 'J.

Rabies surveillance in the United States during 2021.,"OBJECTIVE
To provide epidemiological information on the occurrence of animal and human rabies in the US during 2021 and summaries of 2021 rabies surveillance for Canada and Mexico.


PROCEDURES
State and territorial public health departments and USDA Wildlife Services provided data on animals submitted for rabies testing in 2021. Data were analyzed temporally and geographically to assess trends in domestic animal and wildlife rabies cases.


RESULTS
During 2021, 54 US jurisdictions reported 3,663 rabid animals, representing an 18.2% decrease from the 4,479 cases reported in 2020. Texas (n = 456 [12.4%]), Virginia (297 [8.1%]), Pennsylvania (287 [7.8%]), North Carolina (248 [6.8%]), New York (237 [6.5%]), California (220 [6.0%]), and New Jersey (201 [5.5%]) together accounted for > 50% of all animal rabies cases reported in 2021. Of the total reported rabid animals, 3,352 (91.5%) involved wildlife, with bats (n = 1,241 [33.9%]), raccoons (1,030 [28.1%]), skunks (691 [18.9%]), and foxes (314 [8.6%]) representing the primary hosts confirmed with rabies. Rabid cats (216 [5.9%]), cattle (40 [1.1%]), and dogs (36 [1.0%]) accounted for 94% of rabies cases involving domestic animals in 2021. Five human rabies deaths were reported in 2021.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
The number of animal rabies cases reported in the US decreased significantly during 2021; this is thought to be due to factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",2023,16,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e50f963fe50dfa994a23b7f4232063a5ae330aa9,e50f963fe50dfa994a23b7f4232063a5ae330aa9,"[{'authorId': '93646026', 'name': 'Xiaoyue Ma'}, {'authorId': '118345854', 'name': 'Sarah Bonaparte'}, {'authorId': '152938438', 'name': 'P.

Safety guidelines for youth agricultural work in the United States: A description of the development and updating process,"To reduce the prevalence of youth injuries and fatalities in agricultural settings, safety professionals considered developing a guideline-focused intervention for how and when youth should conduct farm chores. In 1996, the process to create guidelines started, which then expanded to include professionals from the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This team used a consensus driven approach to develop the guidelines and launch the North American Guidelines for Children’s Agricultural Tasks. By 2015, research related to the published guidelines indicated a need to incorporate new empirical evidence and develop dissemination plans based on new technologies. The process for updating the guidelines was supported by a 16-person steering committee and used content experts and technical advisors. The process yielded updated and new guidelines, now called Agricultural Youth Work Guidelines. This report responds to request for further details on the development and update of the guidelines and describes the genesis of the guidelines as an intervention, the process for creating guidelines, recognition of the need to update guidelines based on research, and the process for updating guidelines to assist in others engaged in similar types of interventions.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e25cab4673f9e49c0496c20b4f6b4ded8003c11a,e25cab4673f9e49c0496c20b4f6b4ded8003c11a,"[{'authorId': '47949199', 'name': 'Andrea V.

Research on the International Law of Economic Sanctions Involved in the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Acts of the United States,"The sanctions target of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (2019-2020), the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (2021-2022) and the Strengthening the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (2023-2024) is to enable China to end the alleged large-scale detention, forced labor and any other serious violations. The economic sanctions imposed by the United States on Xinjiang include unilateral economic sanctions and multilateral economic sanctions jointly with Canada and Mexico, which are comprehensive sanctions against Xinjiang, and are industrial sanctions and targeted sanctions for other countries whose related activities have no connection point with the United States. Based on the theory of universal jurisdiction expansion, the United States proposed that Xinjiang violated its obligations to the entire international community. Any country has the right to take sanctions to urge the Xinjiang government to stop its alleged illegal acts. The theories of obligations to the international community as a whole and responsibility to protect are actually a revision of the original theory of humanitarian intervention. China uses objective descriptive words to restore the truth and break the vocabulary trap of Western values. The political and economic pressure exerted by the United States on China made Xinjiang comply with the controversial international law to change its non-existent behavior, and the most vulnerable groups in Xinjiang suffered the collateral impact of economic sanctions. The economic sanctions imposed by the United States on Xinjiang have eroded the WTO principle and trade liberalization. The Provisions on the Unreliable Entity List, the Rules on Counteracting Unjustified Extra-territorial Application of Foreign Legislation and Other Measures, and the Anti-foreign Sanctions Law of China constitute China’s anti-sanctions legal system. China had announced that it would implement corresponding anti-sanctions measures against institutions and individuals involved in Xinjiang issues.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a69d9e97a6da38adc483638249f75cebf61a63b6,a69d9e97a6da38adc483638249f75cebf61a63b6,"[{'authorId': '2268380252', 'name': 'Rongting Zhang'}]"

Supply Diversity in Subscription Video-on-Demand Platforms in Mexico and Canada,"Background: Using the term “cultural diversity” as an analytical framework and normative guideline to assess cultural flows, this article analyzes the catalogs of major platforms for subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) in Mexico and Canada. Analysis: This study systematized the catalogs’ content titles to produce statistics on country of origin as indicators of “supply diversity.” Conclusions and implications: The results reveal that (1) content from the United States and Europe predominates; (2) tech platforms offer a higher degree of international content (“external diversity”) than platforms from traditional Hollywood studios and local companies; and (3) for most platforms, local content is scarce, which could indicate lower “internal diversity.”",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/49b42134923d11c3a0b9eeea3c264b8784187bdc,49b42134923d11c3a0b9eeea3c264b8784187bdc,"[{'authorId': '1783432059', 'name': 'Argelia Muñoz Larroa'}]"

Since most Canadian industries with greater integration are not linked to the automotive industry, these results are curious because, during practically the entire period, the free trade agreement in force was that of the automotive industry.

Bernauer: Other; Self; Employee of OPEN Health and received funding to complete this research. Introduction: X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a rare genetic musculoskeletal disease and the most common form of heritable hypophosphatemic rickets. The objective of this review was to summarize the disease burden and treatment patterns of XLH in the United States (US) and Canada. Methods: Publications from January 1, 2015, to June 3, 2022, were searched using the Medline, Embase, and EconLit databases. Observational studies reporting epidemiology, humanistic burden, economic burden, and treatment patterns in the US and Canada were included. Evidence on epidemiology, humanistic burden, and treatment patterns was expanded to other countries as limited US and Canada studies were identified. Results: A total of 1,218 publications were screened; 42 publications were included (6 from US or Canada; 36 did not report location or were from other countries). Epidemiology data (i.e., incidence, prevalence, mortality) were limited for patients with XLH in the US and Canada. The estimated number of people in the US with XLH was <50,000 in 2021. Globally, the incidence of XLH was estimated at 3.9 per 100,000 live births, and the prevalence ranged from 1.4 per 100,000 to 4.8 per 100,000. One United Kingdom-based study estimated an XLH mortality rate of 12.1 per 1,000 person-years. Sixteen publications reported clinical manifestations of XLH, which showed a high level of heterogeneity. Among children with XLH, frequent clinical manifestations (>80% in 1 or more publications) included active rickets, diminished height, gait disturbance, bone or joint pain, and leg bowing. Among adults with XLH, frequent clinical manifestations (>80% in 1 or more publications) included short stature, leg deformity, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, osteoarthritis, enthesophytes, gait disturbance, dental abscesses, and joint stiffness or restricted range of motion. Humanistic burden data from the US was limited to 2 non-trial publications, which used, respectively, the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Shortform (KOOS-PS) instruments. These 2 publications reported lower health-related quality of life for patients with XLH compared with the general population. No publication was identified on economic burden, treatment patterns, or XLH guidelines in the US or Canada. A consensus statement from a US panel of experts recommends individualization of monitoring and disease management due to clinical heterogeneity. Conclusions: There are limited published data on disease burden or treatment patterns for XLH in the US or Canada. Further research should consider the epidemiological, humanistic, and economic burden of XLH among pediatric and adult populations in these countries.

"Treatment patterns of triple-class refractory (TCR) multiple myeloma (MM) across the United States (US), Canada, and western Europe: A real-world observational chart review study.","e18827 Background: Most patients with MM eventually become refractory to the three main therapy classes used to treat the disease: proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The objective of the present study was to describe the management of patients who have become TCR and how treatment strategies vary across countries. Methods: A retrospective chart review study was conducted across the US, Canada (CA), the UK, France (FR), Germany (DE), Spain (ES), Belgium (BE), the Netherlands (NL), and Sweden (SE). Oncologists/hematologists were recruited to abstract medical chart information from eligible patients (eg, diagnosed with MM, clinician-reported refractoriness to ≥1 IMiD, ≥1 PI, and ≥1 anti-CD38 antibody treatment) into an electronic case report form. Patients had to initiate their first (index) therapy after becoming TCR between 11/1/2015 and 12/31/2019. Chart abstractions were performed from February through October 2022. Demographics, baseline clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns were descriptively analyzed. Results: A total of 718 patients with TCR MM were included (61.4% male; median age at index = 64.2 years); 25.8% had an ECOG score of 2 and 28.7% had high cytogenetic risk [ie, t(4:14), t(14:16), and/or del(17p)]. Patients received a median of 3 treatment lines prior to their index therapy (19.4% were penta-exposed). In the post TCR setting, the most frequently used treatments included IMiDs (52.5%), PIs (40.8%), chemotherapy (CT; 27.3%), and mAbs (16.3%). Treatment class usage also varied significantly by country (Table 1). Conclusions: Our global chart review indicated that many patients reach TCR status after only a few lines of therapy and, after this point, retreating with IMiDs, PIs, and mAbs was common practice. The diversity of treatment classes used in this setting underscores the challenges across countries with managing a TCR population due to the lack of a clear standard of care.

Climatological features of future mesoscale convective systems in convection‐permitting climate models using CMIP6 and ERA5 in the central United States,"Motivated by the limited understanding of future changes in mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), we investigated characteristics of warm‐season (June–August) MCSs in the central United States based on high‐resolution convection‐permitting Weather Research and Forecasting simulations. We examined two 15‐year simulations, which include current simulations (2004–2018) forced by European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) and future simulations (2086–2100) forced by perturbed ERA5 (i.e., ERA5 plus climate change signal derived from 28 Coupled Intercomparison Projected Phase 6 models under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway–Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 emission scenario). The initiations and longevities of MCSs were determined using the object‐tracking algorithm MODE‐Time Domain (MTD) from observation, current simulations (ERA), and future simulations (pseudo‐global warming, PGW). Objects identified by MODE‐Time Domain were divided into short‐/long‐lived (based on 75th percentiles of longevity) and daytime (initiated during 0000–1100 UTC)/nighttime (initiated during 1200–2300 UTC). We found that ERA and observation have comparable occurrences of MCSs. MCSs in PGW are associated with intensified rain rates in New Mexico, Colorado, and Kansas and lower rain rates in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas than in ERA. Moreover, the statistical analysis based on 15 parameters before MCSs initiation indicates that short‐lived MCSs in PGW are characterized by prominent changes in precipitable water (PW) and the most unstable convective available potential energy.

The distribution of triatomine (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in Illinois and Missouri: historical records and specimen submissions from community science programs.,"Triatomine species (kissing bugs) infected with Trypanosoma cruzi are found across the southern United States. The northern limits of Trypanosoma cruzi infected kissing bugs are less understood. The objective of this work was to describe the locations of kissing bugs from Illinois and Missouri based on historical records, submissions to Texas A&M University's (TAMU) Kissing Bug Community Science Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and records from online platforms (iNaturalist, BugGuide, and GBIF) up to and including 2022. A total of 228 records were discovered, including 186 from historical or observation platforms and 42 specimens submitted to TAMU or CDC. Species included Triatoma sanguisuga (221 total records, 9 nymphs) and Triatoma lecticularia (7 records). Notably, nearly all (24/26) records submitted to TAMU were collected indoors. Twelve of the 30 (40%) specimens tested were positive for the presence of T. cruzi, including parasite discrete taxonomic units TcI and TcIV. One triatomine sample had been found in a bed feeding on the submitter; this bug was positive for T. cruzi and had evidence of human blood in its gut. Records suggest a ubiquitous distribution in Missouri and potentially to the northernmost border in Illinois. Further investigations into triatomine distribution and infection status are needed within states assumed to be northern limits in order to create public health and veterinary health messaging and baseline distributional maps from which to measure future range shifts in relation to a changing climate.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26c765439f3ffb2a1f84d0a00d82100d54b09b8f,26c765439f3ffb2a1f84d0a00d82100d54b09b8f,"[{'authorId': '84395187', 'name': 'Ellen M.

A Call for a National Policy of Scheduled Dialysis and Transplantation for All People With Kidney Failure Living in the United States,"On 1 July 2023, we will mark the 50th anniversary of the End-Stage Renal Disease Amendment to the Social Security Act (Public Law 92-603) going into effect. This benefit allows U.S. citizens under age 65 years to have access to lifesaving kidney failure therapies such as dialysis and transplantation paid by Medicare (1). Unfortunately, undocumented immigrants are ineligible for federal health coverage by the Medicare program or the federal health insurance marketplace under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Therefore, they either access private health coverage, often limited by its high costs, or they most commonly remain uninsured awaiting an emergency medical event that would be covered. In their article, Rizzolo and colleagues evaluated the current access to kidney replacement therapies in undocumented immigrants across the United States (2). Only 20 states and the District of Columbia have established coverage for outpatient hemodialysis in undocumented immigrants. Among these, 5 also provide coverage for kidney transplantation. Most states covered hemodialysis and transplantation under emergency Medicaid, whereas New Mexico has a unique pathway through a high-risk health insurance pool for expanded coverage (2). Estimates on the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States range from 11 million to 22 million (3). The top 5 countries of origin for undocumented immigrants are Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, India, and Honduras. Through their labor in areas such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality, they contributed over $9.8 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2019 alone. Yet, they remain largely uninsured. Among the states with the highest proportion of undocumented immigrants, California, New York, and Illinois have statewide coverage for hemodialysis, but Texas, Georgia, Florida, and New Jersey do not (2, 4). According to the United States Renal Data System, nearly 800 000 people in the United States live with kidney failure and it is estimated that approximately 5000 to 9000 are undocumented immigrants (5, 6). Although U.S. citizens complete an end-stage kidney disease medical evidence report (Medicare entitlement form [CMS 2728]), there is no such requirement for undocumented immigrants even in the states where treatment is covered, which makes exact counts and appropriate assessment of quality and costs challenging. Undocumented immigrants with kidney failure have been identified as “superutilizers” of health care services as they receive emergency inpatient dialysis treatment on average 35 times a year, rather than scheduled 3-times-a-week outpatient dialysis. Utilization of emergency dialysis has been estimated to increase costs by $5800 per person permonth andmortality by 15% compared with standard dialysis (7). The proportion of undocumented people affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown. Because two thirds of undocumented immigrants come from Central and South America, they are likely at increased risk for kidney disease and their rates of CKD progression are higher compared with the non-Hispanic population (8). Expanding coverage for kidney replacement methods is necessary, but the ultimate goal is to avoid kidney failure by promoting kidney health. Early referral to a nephrologist provides benefits in mortality, reduced hospitalizations, and shorter hospital lengths of stay. However, undocumented immigrants rarely have access to primary care, which makes early detection and treatment unattainable. Moreover, several studies have demonstrated the increased cost to the health care systems of kidney failure care compared with the management and prevention of CKD. For instance, a recent study from Canada revealed an average yearly cost of CKD care of $14 600 Canadian dollars (U.S. $10 795), nearly 10 times less compared with dialysis patients. Of note, costs, primarily driven by cardiovascular complications and hospitalizations, were higher as the glomerular filtration rate reached 15 or lower (9). Similar trends are seen in the United States and costs will likely drop if early identification and CKDmanagement is performed for at-risk people. All people living in the United States should have access to all available kidney replacement method options. Peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis have demonstrated similar clinical outcomeswith lower costs compared with in-center dialysis but are also infrequently covered for undocumented immigrants. Kidney transplantation, the gold standard in the management of kidney failure, is only offered in 5 states. A recent report illustrates the importance of expanded transplantation for undocumented immigrants as they disproportionally contribute to the deceased donor pool (10). Given their contributions to the transplant allocation system as well as the increasing data demonstrating that transplant outcomes are better, it is time that we work on policies that allow undocumented immigrants living with kidney failure a safe path to scheduled dialysis treatment and, ultimately, transplantation. The clamor for reform is growing.We call for a humane national solution to abandon emergency dialysis as the only option for undocumented immigrants and instead pursue a move toward covering outpatient dialysis (including expanded coverage of dialysis access procedures and home dialysis) in all states. This approach has proven to be both economically and medically advantageous with no evidence of increased undocumented immigration or transplantation tourism. We call on legislators and policymakers to support a pathway for non-U.S. citizens living in the United States, including undocumented immigrants, to be able",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c13bcf4eb340ab71827bf862f89558c56a114327,c13bcf4eb340ab71827bf862f89558c56a114327,"[{'authorId': '2215234973', 'name': 'M.

Oral Health Disparities in United States and Canadian Immigrant Population and Low-income Familie,"Even though our country’s oral health has improved since 1960s; however, the access to these improvements is not equally distributed among all Americans. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, more people are unable to afford dental care than other types of health care. Specifically, in 2015, 29% of the people in the United States have no health insurance, of out which 62% are older adults. Many low-income adults do not have public dental insurance, which includes immigrant population. Specifically, Medicaid programs are not required to provide dental benefits to retiring adults. As a result, currently, there are fifteen states that provide no dental coverage or only emergency coverage for adults who are on Medicaid. Moreover, 40% of low-income and non-Hispanic African American adults have untreated tooth decay. Among children between 2 and 5 years, about 33% of Mexican American and 28% of non-Hispanic African American have had cavities in their primary teeth, compared to 18% of non-Hispanic White children. For children between 12 and 19 years old, about 70% of Mexican American children have had cavities in their primary teeth, compared with 54% of non-Hispanic White children. This paper will discuss the need to respond to these statistics. These oral health disparities do not only have health consequences, but also have social and economic impacts that cannot be overlooked (CDC.gov, 2021).",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d6cd651b558793688bd758debda113ef1e323227,d6cd651b558793688bd758debda113ef1e323227,"[{'authorId': '2240887013', 'name': 'William Avdeev'}]"
Epinephrine treatment of food-induced and other cause anaphylaxis in United States and Canadian Emergency Departments: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"ABSTRACT Introduction Studies from more than 10 years ago showed epinephrine treatment of food-induced anaphylaxis in the emergency department (ED) was unacceptably low. We investigated whether epinephrine treatment of food-induced and other cause anaphylaxis in United States and Canadian EDs has changed over time. Methods Guided by a health sciences librarian, we performed a systematic search in Medline, Embase, and Web of Science on 11 January 2023. We included observational studies that reported epinephrine use to treat anaphylaxis in the ED. We stratified by anaphylaxis etiology (food-, venom-, medication-induced, or any cause). Associations between year and epinephrine use were tested using Spearman correlation and proportional meta-analysis. Results Of 2458 records identified in our initial search, 40 met inclusion criteria. Of these, 14 examined food-induced, 4 venom-induced, 0 medication-induced, and 24 any cause anaphylaxis. For epinephrine treatment of food-induced anaphylaxis in the ED, among studies using similar definition of anaphylaxis, meta-analysis showed a pooled value of 20.7% (95% CI 17.8, 23.8) for studies performed >10 years ago and 45.1% (95% CI 38.4, 52.0) from those in the last 10 years. For anaphylaxis of any cause, there was no change over time, with a pooled value of 45.0% (95% CI 39.8, 50.3) over the last 10 years. Discussion Epinephrine treatment of food-induced anaphylaxis in the ED has increased over time. There was no clear change for anaphylaxis of any cause. Over the last 10 years, approximately 45% of ED patients with anaphylaxis received epinephrine. A limitation of the evidence is heterogeneity in anaphylaxis definitions.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3d2b15ba7d87e727fb18a93abe0ae0aa22aa4ec,b3d2b15ba7d87e727fb18a93abe0ae0aa22aa4ec,"[{'authorId': '2143240237', 'name': 'G.

The genus Astragalus (Leguminosae: Papilionoideae: Galegeae) in Mexico,"Astragalus is the most diverse genus within flowering plants with almost 2500 species, it is widely distributed around the world, very abundant in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, in central and western Asia, Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan, central Asia, Europe, Mongolia, Siberia, northeastern China, and Japan. In the American continent it is especially abundant in Canada, western United States, Mexico, and South America. Given the diversity of Astragalus species present in Mexico, the recent description of at least 15 new species for this country, the absence of a recent study that encompasses all the new findings and that the last general study for Mexico dates back almost 60 years, we consider necessary a new taxonomic synopsis that encompasses all the new information, which is presented here. The study records 102 species of Astragalus in Mexico. This work is based essentially on the review of collections of specimen samples, type specimens in national and foreign herbaria, data bases, and the collection of specimens of this genus by the authors in the last 40 years and that covers practically the entire area where this genus is distributed in Mexico. In this study we recorded 102 species and 46 infraspecific taxa; seventy one species and 17 varieties are endemic to Mexico. Baja California (32), Chihuahua (25), Durango (23), Sonora (22), Coahuila (20), San Luis Potosí (17), Nuevo León (17), and Zacatecas (15) are the states with the greatest species richness. In Mexico, the diversity of Astragalus species decreases from north to south and from west to east. Most of the species of Astragalus in Mexico are distributed in the mountains, followed by low and arid plains, including coastal dunes, those last ones, exclusively of the northwestern region. There are no records of any Astragalus species in Campeche, Tabasco, Quintana Roo or Yucatan. The dichotomous keys are based mainly on the color of flowers, the shape of the pod and if the fruit is sessile or stipitate. For each species is included also a morphological description, habitat, altitudinal range, and distribution map.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3346d19be9304cb4a3a5060311f2072ea9b8cadc,3346d19be9304cb4a3a5060311f2072ea9b8cadc,"[{'authorId': '2125631078', 'name': 'Eduardo ESTRADA CASTILLÓN'}, {'authorId': '2125638849', 'name': 'José Ángel Villarreal Quintanilla'}, {'authorId': '1399265321', 'name': 'A.

Mobilization and Strategies: Comparing Trade Lobbying in the US and Canada,"Do US lobbying patterns extend to other countries? To date no study has systematically compared US lobbying patterns with those of other countries using observational data. Taking advantage of similar lobbying disclosure rules in the US and Canada, we create a cross-country lobbying dataset. We focus on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to control for timing, salience, and issue scope. This helps us attribute differences in firm mobilization and trade lobbying strategies across the two countries to differences in political institutions. Strikingly different USMCA lobbying patterns emerge. Within the same industry, trade associations, the executive branch, and in-house lobbyists play a larger role in Canada. Meanwhile, well-established determinants of US lobbying fail to explain patterns of mobilization and the use of external lobbyists in Canada. These findings provide insights into comparative lobbying studies and indicate that some stylized facts about lobbying are unique features of the US political system.",2023,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9614958376d0a67c83539ca2714340a7c8e77160,9614958376d0a67c83539ca2714340a7c8e77160,"[{'authorId': '2136115349', 'name': 'Jieun Lee'}, {'authorId': '116946889', 'name': 'Jan Stuckatz'}]"
First record of Sclerocactus papyracanthus (Cactaceae) in Mexico Primer registro de Sclerocactus papyracanthus (Cactaceae) en México,": Background and Aims: Sclerocactus (Cactaceae) is a genus that comprises 27 taxa mainly distributed in the southern United States of America and northern Mexico. Sclerocactus papyracanthus is a very distinctive species due to its flattened papyraceous central spines and its growth form, which is similar to that of some grasses. Its currently known distribution is in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas in the southern USA close to the border with Mexico. How - ever, we detected an observation of a putative individual of this species in Chihuahua on the Naturalista platform. Therefore, we set out to find individuals of S. papyracanthus in Mexico, describe their morphology, its ecological preferences, and document their occurrence in this country with herbarium specimens, photographs, and illustrations. Methods: Using the location indicated in the Naturalista observation, we carried out two explorations in early 2023 to the state of Chihuahua in search of the species. A cactus population that resembled S. papyracanthus was found. We took photographs, measured and described the morphological characters of the found individuals, and prepared herbarium specimens. The obtained morphological and ecological data were compared with those reported in the scientific literature and with other available herbarium vouchers. Key results: The morphological comparisons corroborated that the Sclerocactus population found corresponded to S. papyracanthus and the presence of the species in Mexico was confirmed. A total of 38 plants of different sizes were found. Also, two young individuals flowering were documented. Conclusions: In Mexico, S. papyracanthus is now known from a single grassland locality in the municipality of Ascensi ó n, Chihuahua.

"Absent, Repressive, and Criminalized States: Forced Internal Displacement and Irregular Migration in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala","Nearly a million people from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala have been internally displaced in recent years, and hundreds of thousands more have fled to Mexico, the United States, Canada, and Europe. An extensive literature provides evidence that direct and structural violence are the principal drivers of this phenomenon. Largely unexamined is the way in which the governments of the region contribute to and in certain critical respects create the conditions that underlie this mass human movement. Exploration of this gang-related forced displacement and irregular migration reveals the role of absent, repressive, and criminalized state postures and the corresponding neglect of the lower-income sectors as contributors to the crisis. Casi un millón de habitantes en El Salvador, Honduras y Guatemala han sido desplazados internamente en los últimos años, y cientos de miles más han huido a México, Estados Unidos, Canadá y Europa.

"Abundance and occupancy of the western yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus) in Sonora, Mexico","Unveiling factors that determine abundance and distribution of endangered wildlife species has important implications for their conservation across international boundaries. For instance, the Western Distinct Population (as defined by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) of the yellow-billed cuckoo Coccyzus americanus (Linnaeus, 1758) has disappeared in most of the species’ range across western United States and southwestern Canada but little is known about the conservation status at the southern edge of its breeding distribution in Mexico. To fill this information gap, we estimated abundance and occupancy rates of yellow-billed cuckoos using a standard broadcast call survey protocol. We used Bayesian spatial count models to estimate cuckoo population density at survey sites. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate the effects of geography, climate, and vegetation on occupancy rates while accounting for imperfect detection. Mean cuckoo count per transect for all sites was C = 9.00 ± 0.45 cuckoos. Overall cuckoo density was D = 13.18 cuckoos/km2 (SD(D) = 5.61 cuckoos/km2). Overall cuckoo occupancy in Sonora was ψ = 0.538 (95%CrI(ψ) = 0.488–0.600), but showed strong geographic variation. Relatively high occupancy levels suggest yellow-billed cuckoo populations in Sonora may be robust, but they are largely reliant on declining high-tree cover.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d9473a492dea16985016435265318d12066c411a,d9473a492dea16985016435265318d12066c411a,"[{'authorId': '1413729738', 'name': 'A.

Rigged Elections: The Failure of Mexico’s New Labor Model to Protect Farmworker Rights,"Due to recent labor reforms and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) negotiation, Mexico ratified freedom of association and collective bargaining rights. This new labor model promises the end of employer protection unions that thwart labor organizing and drive down wages. Through an ethnographic case study of farm labor organizing in the agro-export industry in San Quintín, Baja California, Mexico, this article argues that recent labor reforms are not sufficient to democratize labor relations in rural industries as they fail to overcome regional and transnational power structures. Although limited to one case, this article fills a gap in the literature on the impact of recent labor reforms on farmworkers. Mexico’s salaried agricultural workers offer critical insights into the promises and failures of current efforts to reform labor laws and remediate the adverse effects of economic integration.

"Agapostemonfasciatus Crawford (Hymenoptera, Halictidae), a valid North American bee species ranging into southern Canada","Abstract Background Sweat bees of the genus Agapostemon Guérin-Méneville, 1844 (Hymenoptera: Halictidae) are common and widespread in the Americas. Despite distinct morphological characters that were recognised in earlier taxonomic treatments, Agapostemonfasciatus Crawford, 1901 has been considered a variety of A.melliventris Cresson, 1874 since the 1930s and later placed into synonymy under A.melliventris in the early 1970s. New information A more detailed study of morphology (including examination of type materials), distribution and genetic data (i.e. DNA barcodes) of these two taxa suggests they are not conspecific. As such, A.fasciatus is resurrected as a valid North American bee species. Agapostemonfasciatus ranges further north in North America than A.mellivenrtis, reaching the southern Prairies Ecozone of Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan), while most records of A.melliventris are from the south-western United States and northern Mexico. More accurate distributions for both species can be modelled as specimens in collections are identified using the diagnostic features provided.

Fallout from U.S. atmospheric nuclear tests in New Mexico and Nevada (1945-1962),"One hundred and one atmospheric nuclear weapon tests were conducted between 1945 and 1962 in the United States, resulting in widespread dispersion of radioactive fallout, and leading to environmental contamination and population exposures. Accurate assessment of the extent of fallout from nuclear weapon tests has been challenging in the United States and elsewhere, due to limited monitoring and data accessibility. Here we address this deficit by combining U.S. government data, high-resolution reanalyzed historical weather fields, and atmospheric transport modeling to reconstruct radionuclide deposition across the contiguous United States, with 10-kilometer spatial and one-hour temporal resolution for five days following detonation, from all 94 atmospheric tests detonated in New Mexico and Nevada with fission yields sufficient to generate mushroom clouds. Our analysis also includes deposition estimates for 10 days following the detonation of Trinity, the first ever nuclear weapon test, on July 16, 1945. We identify locations where radionuclide deposition significantly exceeded levels in areas covered by the U.S. Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). These findings include deposition in all 48 contiguous U.S. states. They provide an opportunity for re-evaluating the public health and environmental implications from atmospheric nuclear testing. Finally, our findings also speak to debates about marking the beginning of the Anthropocene with nuclear weapons fallout. Our deposition estimates indicate that direct fallout from Trinity, a plutonium device, reached Crawford Lake in Canada, the proposed""golden spike""site marking the beginning of the Anthropocene epoch, starting on July 20, 1945.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6ca45dd2aac474840b3c44805816ed82e3be409c,6ca45dd2aac474840b3c44805816ed82e3be409c,"[{'authorId': '4407326', 'name': 'Sébastien Philippe'}, {'authorId': '1823690988', 'name': 'S.

During the summer of 2022, two Saildrone platforms were deployed in the Gulf of Mexico to provide data at two NDBC buoy locations that were non-operational at the start of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season. The two locations are at 42001, Mid Gulf, and 42003, East Gulf. Two Saildrones were deployed for three-month missions from early September 2022 until early December 2022. Saildrone SD-1042 (WMO ID 42501) was deployed to circle around the position of buoy 42001, while Saildrone SD-1036 (WMO ID 42503) was deployed to circle around the position of buoy 42003. The Saildrones were expected to stay within a 10 nm radius of each buoy location to be considered on station. The Saildrone platforms and NDBC buoys were equipped to collect similar meteorological and ocean observations. The Saildrones reported their data to NDBC once per hour, while the NDBC buoys reported their data every 10 minutes with the wave data reported once per hour. Data from the Saildrones were sent to NDBC for processing and distribution. The data were ingested into the NDBC real-time processing system, quality controlled, and pushed to the Global Telecommuncations System (GTS) for ingestion into the global weather enterprise. In addition, all Saildrone data were publicly released on the NDBC website. Based on limited past comparisons to moored platforms, NDBC completed a validation of the Saildrone data collected by comparing its data to similar data collected at stations 42001 and 42003. The high resolution 10-minute data from the buoys were used as the reference basis for the comparison, except for hourly wave data. In the case of the Saildrones, hourly data were compared due to the lack of high resolution data sent to NDBC. The means and standard deviations for wind direction, wind speed, gust, air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, sea surface temperature, significant wave height, and dominant period were compared. The mean and standard deviation of the difference between the observations, the difference root mean square value, and the maximum and minimum differences were also calculated. Finally, the slope and intercept values for the regression between the two measurement time series were derived. Results of the comparison indicated that the Saildrone sensors performed well while on station with a few exceptions. Saildrone performance regarding station keeping was degraded based upon environmental conditions, especially at 42003 where SD1036 was on station for only half of the mission. Data transmission was successful, with over 99% of the received data pushed to the GTS. The intercomparison demonstrated the Saildrones were able to provide observations comparable to those collected on a moored buoy with a couple exceptions. The barometer mean error and RMS error were just outside of the NDBC accuracy specification of ±1.0 mb, and the wind observations showed mixed results with respect to the NDBC accuracy specifications. More investigation is needed to understand the root cause of the wind direction and speed anomalies. Future work includes another planned USV deployment off the U.S. West Coast in an area with more operational constraints, such as operating in a National Marine Sanctuary. Lessons learned from the 2022 deployments will impact the 2023 deployment. Data management processes will be improved to realize the full potential of USVs in supplementing the NDBC observational network. Operational constraints, such as the watch circle radius, will be re-evaluated. Benefits of utilizing USVs include the ability to sustain and improve the NDBC observing network by leveraging observations through public-private partnerships to ensure the New Blue Economy while also demonstrating NOAA's commitment to operationalize uncrewed maritime systems (UMS) within established observational networks.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3528b76bc82df65551aab51a07186b91db7531a0,3528b76bc82df65551aab51a07186b91db7531a0,"[{'authorId': '5237207', 'name': 'D.

Treatment of orbital floor fractures in a reference center in Mexico city,"Background: Orbital trauma accounts for approximately 3% of all emergency department visits, with approximately 4.4 million annual visits in the United States alone. We aim to describe the treatment of adult patients with orbital floor fractures between 2016 and 2021.
Methods: A retrospective, descriptive, cross-sectional, and observational study was conducted on the medical records of adult patients with orbital floor fractures between 2016 and 2021 in a referral center in Mexico city.
Results: The study included 53 patients, 5 females (8%) and 48 males (92%), with a median age of 37 years at the time of diagnosis. Among the reported trauma mechanisms, falls and violence were the most common. 4 patients (7.5%) had impure right unilateral fractures, 4 patients (7.5%) had impure left unilateral fractures, 18 patients (33.9%) had pure left unilateral fractures, 22 patients (41.5%) had pure right unilateral fractures. Five patients (9.4%) had pure bilateral fractures. Six (11.3%) received non-surgical treatment, while 47 (88.6%) underwent surgical treatment. The most common surgical approach was the transconjunctival with lateral extension.
Conclusions: There was a predominance of male patients and physical aggression as the primary trauma mechanism. Automated vehicle accidents were associated with more complex fractures. The most common type of orbital floor fracture was pure right unilateral. Most patients underwent open reduction with internal fixation.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d28a0623381c9f734069a131e9c7c6adbb4c14e5,d28a0623381c9f734069a131e9c7c6adbb4c14e5,"[{'authorId': '2269647073', 'name': 'Brandon Heftye-Sánchez'}, {'authorId': '2269647058', 'name': 'Valentina Prieto-Vargas'}, {'authorId': '2269645339', 'name': 'Omar S.

"Process description of developing HIV prevention monitoring indicators for a province-wide pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) program in British Columbia, Canada","In 2018, the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) program was initiated in British Columbia (BC), Canada, providing PrEP at no cost to qualifying residents. This observational study discussed the steps to develop key evidence-based monitoring indicators and their calculation using real-time data. The indicators were conceptualized, developed, assessed and approved by the Technical Monitoring Committee of representatives from five health authority regions in BC, the BC Ministry of Health, the BC Centre for Disease Control, and the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS. Indicator development followed the steps adopted from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention framework for program evaluation in public health. The assessment involved eight selection criteria: data quality, indicator validity, existing scientific evidence, indicator informativeness, indicator computing feasibility, clients’ confidentiality maintenance capacity, indicator accuracy, and administrative considerations. Clients’ data from the provincial-wide PrEP program (January 2018—December 2020) shows the indicators’ calculation. The finalized 14 indicators included gender, age, health authority, new clients enrolled by provider type and by the health authority, new clients dispensed PrEP, clients per provider, key qualifying HIV risk factor(s), client status, PrEP usage type, PrEP quantity dispensed, syphilis and HIV testing and incident cases, and adverse drug reaction events. Cumulative clients’ data (n = 6966; 99% cis-gender males) identified an increased new client enrollment and an unexpected drop during the COVID-19 pandemic. About 80% dispensed PrEP from the Vancouver Coastal health authority. The HIV incidence risk index for men who have sex with men score ≥10 was the most common qualifying risk factor. The framework we developed integrating indicators was applied to monitor our PrEP program, which could help reduce the public health impact of HIV.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7bfe33fde822de5808cb09fcff7e21fd64ea5a31,7bfe33fde822de5808cb09fcff7e21fd64ea5a31,"[{'authorId': '3895091', 'name': 'L.

"The establishment of the association between the Japanese beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) and the parasitoid Istocheta aldrichi (Diptera: Tachinidae) in Québec, Canada","Abstract We explored ecological aspects of the early establishment of the association between the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica (Newman) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), and the adult tachinid parasitoid, Istocheta aldrichi (Mesnil) (Diptera: Tachinidae), in the province of Québec, Canada. The Japanese beetle started its invasion in the late 1930s, whereas I. aldrichi was detected only in 2009. It is assumed that I. aldrichi spread in the province from its introduced range in the northeastern United States of America. Throughout the summer, we used baited traps in eight localities of southern Québec (2018–2019) and in 13 raspberry (Rubus idaeus) fields (2022) localised along a latitudinal gradient to describe the distribution and seasonal occurrence of both species and the parasitism rates of I. aldrichi. We also mapped observational data from the online platform iNaturalist to further describe the current distribution of both the host and its parasitoid. Results indicate that I. aldrichi is well spread in southern Québec and along the St. Lawrence River in most areas where the Japanese beetle is present. Parasitism mostly occurs from late June to mid-July, before the peak of Japanese beetle populations, and levels of total seasonal parasitism range from 3.9 to 27.3% across sampled sites. Together, trap captures and data from iNaturalist provide evidence that I. aldrichi is now established in most areas of the province of Québec where the Japanese beetle is present.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c0c0f80b65135a4c26fe6b28083b402a1d825e9,0c0c0f80b65135a4c26fe6b28083b402a1d825e9,"[{'authorId': '2265305531', 'name': 'Marie-Eve Gagnon'}, {'authorId': '40579603', 'name': 'J.

The observation of birds from a citizen science leisure project to systematic research,"This article analyses historical data from observations made of birds in breeding season, throughout two routes with urban characteristics. The data were collected during a consecutive period of 10 years (2009-2018), following a precise methodology designed by the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The analyzed routes are officially registered in the Mexican Commission for Biodiversity’s Knowledge and Use, the United States Geological Survey Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, and the Canadian Wildlife Service Research Centre. The observations were made by citizens without formal professional education; hence the results may be considered within the framework of citizen science. Their contributions provided important data for decision-making regarding environmental issues, since the presence of birds is considered one of the main indicators of the health conditions of an ecosystem. Data analysis identified two basic conditions: (i) a reduction of the 23% in the number of species found, many of which disappeared during counting; and (ii) the significant increase in population of other species, including three species of pigeons. Apart from the study of variations in the numbers of bird species present in the routes with urban characteristics, the article acknowledges the lack of connection and use of this citizen science for decision-making and education regarding environmental issues. Therefore, we consider it crucial to create scientific observations that are available to both experts in the field and to the general population, which is the essence of citizen science.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac74d3d73f8b56acae5a6211a855d2036cb4062d,ac74d3d73f8b56acae5a6211a855d2036cb4062d,"[{'authorId': '1413110023', 'name': 'Fidel González-Quiñones'}, {'authorId': '2289405689', 'name': 'Luis Roberto Granados-Campos'}, {'authorId': '2227564611', 'name': 'José Manuel Jurado-Ruiz'}, {'authorId': '2089350097', 'name': 'Javier Tarango'}, {'authorId': '1400480856', 'name': 'Juan D.

An estimated 240 000 to 350 000 persons in the United States are infected, primarily immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and South America, where the disease is endemic. The parasite is transmitted by the triatomine bug but can also be passed through blood transfusion, via organ transplant, or congenitally. Approximately 30% of infected persons later develop cardiac and/or gastrointestinal complications. Health care providers should consider screening at-risk patients with serologic testing.

"Current Insights into Diagnosis, Prevention Strategies, Treatment, Therapeutic Targets, and Challenges of Monkeypox (Mpox) Infections in Human Populations","In the wake of the emergence and worldwide respread of a viral infection called Monkeypox (Mpox), there is a serious threat to the health and safety of the global population. This viral infection was endemic to the western and central parts of Africa, but has recently spread out of this endemic area to various countries, including the United Kingdom (UK), Portugal, Spain, the United States of America (USA), Canada, Sweden, Belgium, Italy, Australia, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Israel, and Mexico. This is a timely review focusing on recent findings and developments in the epidemiology, clinical features, therapeutic targets, diagnosis, prevention mechanisms, research challenges and possible treatment for Mpox. To date (29 November 2022), there have been around 81,225 reported cases of Mpox. In most cases, this illness is mild; however, there is a fatality rate ranging from 1 to 10%, which might be increased due to associated complications and/or secondary infections. There is a real challenge in the diagnosis of Mpox, since its symptoms are very similar to those of other infections, including smallpox and chickenpox. Generally, to prevent/limit the risk and transmission of Mpox, the detection and isolation of infected individuals, as well as hand hygiene and cleanliness, are essential and effective approaches to control/combat this viral infection. Nevertheless, updated information about Mpox from different angles is lacking. Thus, this review provides updated and comprehensive information about the Mpox illness, which should highlight the global burden, pathogenicity, symptoms, diagnosis, prevention measures and possible treatment of this emerging disease.",2023,15,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5cc7dd65c5ee5b7ae5234cf7f7b798ffa66bdc9d,5cc7dd65c5ee5b7ae5234cf7f7b798ffa66bdc9d,"[{'authorId': '101591180', 'name': 'Mitesh Patel'}, {'authorId': '40222517', 'name': 'M.

The Effect of Immigration Restrictions on Local Labor Markets: Lessons from the 1920s Border Closure,"In the 1920s, the United States substantially reduced immigration by imposing country-specific entry quotas. We compare local labor markets differentially exposed to the quotas due to variation in the national-origin mix of their immigrant population. US-born workers in areas losing immigrants did not benefit relative to workers in less exposed areas. Instead, in urban areas, European immigrants were replaced with internal migrants and immigrants from Mexico and Canada. By contrast, farmers shifted toward capital-intensive agriculture, and the immigrant-intensive mining industry contracted. These differences highlight the uneven effects of the quota system at the local level.

"A Preliminary Assessment of Global CO2: Spatial Patterns, Temporal Trends, and Policy Implications","This study offers a comprehensive analysis of the distribution, evolution, and driving factors of CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2016 at multiple spatial scales. Utilizing 26 indicators encompassing various facets of CO2 emissions, it is employed principal component analysis (PCA) and empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) to identify the dominant characteristics of global CO2 emissions. This model retained three core components, accounting for 93% of the global CO2 variation, reflecting emission trajectories and associated economic metrics, such as Gross domestic product (GDP). The analysis differentiated the effects of these components based on countries' economic standings. Using a novel aggregated index, significant national contributors to global CO2 emissions are pinpointed. Notably, the leading contributors are found among developed nations (e.g., the United States, Canada, Japan), Gulf states (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Qatar), and emerging economies (e.g., China, Brazil, Mexico). Furthermore, these results highlight that shifts in global CO2 emissions over the past 30 years are predominantly influenced by factors like industrial emissions and GDP. Results also demonstrate a distinct relationship between a country's CO2 emissions and its physical and socioeconomic factors. Specifically, the nation's coastline length, population density in coastal regions, and the diversity of its climatic conditions significantly influence its carbon footprint.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fb84e8866f5a9915cb76e39107c9ba5c6bb48c31,fb84e8866f5a9915cb76e39107c9ba5c6bb48c31,"[{'authorId': '2267644903', 'name': 'Ahmed M.

Co-Infection of Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus and Pepino Mosaic Virus in Grocery Tomatoes in South Florida: Prevalence and Genomic Diversity,"Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) is an economically important seed and mechanically transmitted pathogen of significant importance to tomato production around the globe. Synergistic interaction with pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), another seed and mechanically transmitted virus, and long-distance dissemination of these two viruses via contaminated tomato fruits through global marketing were previously suggested. In 2019, we detected both viruses in several grocery store-purchased tomatoes in South Florida, USA. In this study, to identify potential sources of inoculum, co-infection status, prevalence, and genomic diversity of these viruses, we surveyed symptomatic and asymptomatic imported tomatoes sold in ten different groceries in four cities in South Florida. According to the product labels, all collected tomatoes originated from Canada, Mexico, or repacking houses in the United States. With high prevalence levels, 86.5% of the collected samples were infected with ToBRFV, 90% with PepMV alone, and 73% were mixed-infected. The phylogenetic study showed no significant correlations between ToBRFV genomic diversity and the tomato label origin. Phylogenetic analysis of PepMV isolates revealed the prevalence of the PepMV strains, Chilean (CH2) and recombinant (US2).

New notions of soft power: Impact rhetoric in mega-event bid documents,"This viewpoint addresses notions of impact and soft power. Two bidding documents submitted in 2018 by Morocco and a joint bid by Canada, Mexico, and the United States are explored, focusing specifically on language used when discuss the term “impact.” Soft power is important to consider and use as a framework for interpretation because bidding for events involves the ability to persuade and use power as a medium to showcase the ability to host. Both bid proposals place less attention on economic impact, and emphasize the social and environmental impact that these events will have. Each bid document had a defined statement on legacy, but legacy did not dominate either bid as both put focus on how they would create impact in the present time. This approach is something that brings people into the directions of the bid, in terms of how social, economic, or environmental impact would be achieved, and directives positioned how they would make people aware of impact.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff844cb0dd4c979723e0401bdd48e7c404c01e0c,ff844cb0dd4c979723e0401bdd48e7c404c01e0c,"[{'authorId': '2239945918', 'name': 'Nicholas Wise'}, {'authorId': '108685535', 'name': 'J.

How Societal Forces of Change Are Transforming Youth Physical Activity Promotion in North America.,"BACKGROUND
Climate change, increasing recognition of institutionalized discrimination, and the COVID-19 pandemic are large-scale, societal events (ie, forces of change) that affect the timing, settings, and modes of youth physical activity. Despite the impact that forces of change have on youth physical activity and physical activity environments, few studies consider how they affect physical activity promotion.


METHODS
The authors use 2 established frameworks, the ecological model of physical activity and the youth physical activity timing, how, and setting framework, to highlight changes in physical activity patterns of youth in North America that have resulted from contemporary forces of change.


RESULTS
North American countries-Canada, Mexico, and the United States-have faced similar but contextually different challenges for promoting physical activity in response to climate change, increasing recognition of institutionalized discrimination, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Innovative applications of implementation science, digital health technologies, and community-based participatory research methodologies may be practical for increasing and sustaining youth physical activity in response to these forces of change.


CONCLUSIONS
Thoughtful synthesis of existing physical activity frameworks can help to guide the design and evaluation of new and existing physical activity initiatives. Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers are encouraged to carefully consider the intended and unintended consequences of actions designed to respond to forces of change.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40e17fef1b33862d26b496e3e56f5002084941c6,40e17fef1b33862d26b496e3e56f5002084941c6,"[{'authorId': '2203094511', 'name': 'Jacob Szeszulski'}, {'authorId': '39230104', 'name': 'Jamie M.

A Review of User Perceptions of Drought Indices and Indicators Used in the Diverse Climates of North America,"Drought monitoring and early detection have improved greatly in recent decades through the development and refinement of numerous indices and indicators. However, a lack of guidance, based on user experience, exists as to which drought-monitoring tools are most appropriate in a given location. This review paper summarizes the results of targeted user engagement and the published literature to improve the understanding of drought across North America and to enhance the utility of drought-monitoring tools. Workshops and surveys were used to assess and make general conclusions about the perceived performance of drought indicators, indices and impact information used for monitoring drought in the five main Köppen climate types (Tropical, Temperate, Continental, Polar Tundra, Dry) found across Canada, Mexico, and the United States. In Tropical, humid Temperate, and southerly Continental climates, droughts are perceived to be more short-term (less than 6 months) in duration rather than long-term (more than 6 months). In Polar Tundra climates, Dry climates, Temperate climates with dry warm seasons, and northerly Continental climates, droughts are perceived to be more long-term than short-term. In general, agricultural and hydrological droughts were considered to be the most important drought types. Drought impacts related to agriculture, water supply, ecosystem, and human health were rated to be of greatest importance. Users identified the most effective indices and indicators for monitoring drought across North America to be the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (or another measure of precipitation anomaly), followed by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (or another satellite-observed vegetation index), temperature anomalies, crop status, soil moisture, streamflow, reservoir storage, water use (demand), and reported drought impacts. Users also noted the importance of indices that measure evapotranspiration, evaporative demand, and snow water content. Drought indices and indicators were generally thought to perform equally well across seasons in Tropical and colder Continental climates, but their performance was perceived to vary seasonally in Dry, Temperate, Polar Tundra, and warmer Continental climates, with improved performance during warm and wet times of the year. The drought indices and indicators, in general, were not perceived to perform equally well across geographies. This review paper provides guidance on when (time of year) and where (climate zone) the more popular drought indices and indicators should be used. The paper concludes by noting the importance of understanding how drought, its impacts, and its indicators are changing over time as the climate warms and by recommending ways to strengthen the use of indices and indicators in drought decision making.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66d5b33c254552640423e84521b20675c2e1e180,66d5b33c254552640423e84521b20675c2e1e180,"[{'authorId': '2273121751', 'name': 'Richard R.

Effectiveness of the voluntary disclosure of corporate information and its commitment to climate change,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although governments and companies have been implementing various measures, such as technological innovation, new emissions regulations, and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it seems that global warming is not decreasing. In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the commitments of companies were considered to be the key for climate change. However, since the Paris Climate Agreement, there has not been an accurate evaluation of the efforts and contributions of companies toward emission reductions. This study investigated the effectiveness of companies in Climate Action and tested its impact on greenhouse gas emissions at the country and per capita levels. METHODS: This study focuses on companies of the countries from the main Latin American economies (Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina) and their major trading partners (the United States of America, Canada, China, Korea, Germany, and Japan). There are 894 companies from Latin America and 3680 companies that represent their trading partners of referred countries in Climate Action. This study used two data sources, the commitment of companies from Global Climate Action and the annual greenhouse gas emissions levels of each country from an open-access data platform called Our World in Data. FINDINGS: The findings demonstrate a significant and positive relationship between changes in greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 and 2020 and the number of companies participating in Global Climate Action (Pearson = .718*, significance = .013) and per capita (Pearson = 0.827** significance = 0.002). Correlations indicate there is a higher level of commitment to climate action but with marginal contributions to greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Previous expectations were that greater corporate involvement in climate action would reflect a link to greenhouse gas reductions, but this was not the case. Additionally, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions during the pandemic was due to the economic slowdown and was not necessarily because of the climate action efforts of companies and governments to reduce emissions. The findings demonstrated a negative and significant correlation at the country level during the pandemic (Pearson = −0.629 significance = .038). The lack of effective results for reducing (from 2020 and 2021) greenhouse gas emissions justifies the relevance of increasing transparency and accountability for both companies and countries. The acceleration of the production system reflected in an increase in greenhouse gas emissions is not keeping pace with the commitments and the reported achievements on Global Climate Action. CONCLUSION: This study contributed to justifying efforts for a better way to follow up international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Transparency and accountability are key to effectively achieving greenhouse gas reductions and curbing the impending climate crisis.

"Animosity, Social Return, and Intent to Travel: Social Return’s Dissipating Influence Over Animosity","While many have noted how country-level animosity negatively influences destination choice, little is known about factors that may dissipate animosity’s pervasive influence over destination choice. This paper uses Cognitive Dissonance Theory as the theoretical backing to investigate how social return, a consonant cognition focused on the anticipated positive responses from posting travel photos on social media, mediates the negative influence of animosity, a dissonant cognition, has on intent to travel. One thousand six hundred fifty-three respondents from the United States’ top five international markets (Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, and the U.K.) were surveyed with results showing social return partially mediating the relationship between animosity and intent to travel. These findings suggest target markets with high levels of animosity should not be entirely abandoned because there are psychological mechanisms to help dissipate or alleviate the negative effects of animosity.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8cbc399fed946ac1b3009ad5dec139a140bdbd61,8cbc399fed946ac1b3009ad5dec139a140bdbd61,"[{'authorId': '90459383', 'name': 'B.

The UK’s new free trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific: how closely is it adopting US trade regulation?,"Abstract In a global economy and system increasingly defined by new developments and complexities in trade, whose rules and regulations govern that trade matter. The UK has embarked on a new post-Brexit trade policy, signing its first wholly new free trade agreements (FTAs) with Australia and New Zealand. It is also in negotiations to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) as part of the UK’s aspirations to become an integral part of the Asia-Pacific trading community. This study’s research and text analysis on the UK’s bilateral FTAs with Australia and New Zealand reveals high levels of similarity with two larger regional agreements heavily imprinted with US trade regulatory norms—this being the CPTPP itself and the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). The UK’s revealed willingness to strongly align itself with US trade regulatory norms has important implications for the Asia-Pacific. It also raises some key issues on what kind of trade partner the region might expect a post-Brexit ‘Global Britain’ to become, and how the UK’s deeper planned engagement with the Asia-Pacific could affect its strategic dynamics. This could significantly depend on how closely the UK is pulled over time into the US’ trade regulatory orbit.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a3f1476b9d04113ebbde9e7f5413b4ecb2b3d70b,a3f1476b9d04113ebbde9e7f5413b4ecb2b3d70b,"[{'authorId': '49035750', 'name': 'C.

Vaping and Mental Health Conditions in Children: An Umbrella Review,"The e-cigarette (EC) epidemic began in the United States (US) in 2007; since 2014 EC is the most commonly used form of tobacco. However, the mental health implications of vaping are grossly unknown. The aim of this umbrella review is to provide astate-of-the-art summary of existing research concerning vaping and mental health conditions in children. Following the PRISMA Statement 2020 guidelines, a systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar up to April 15th, 2022 to locate relevant studies. The Joana Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for umbrella reviews and quality appraisal tool was utilized. Six studies, pooling a total of 846,510 adolescents aged 21 years or below, were included by collating 85 primary clinical studies. Of these, 58.8% of the primary clinical studies originated in the US, with 4.7% from Canada, South Korea, and the United Kingdom each; 3.5% each from England and Taiwan; 2.4% each from Australia, France, Hawaii, Mexico, and Russia; and 1.2% each from Denmark, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, New Zealand, Poland, and Switzerland. Overall, significant associations were found between mental health outcomes, including depression and suicidality, among current EC users and those who had ever used EC. Compared to adolescents who had never used EC, both depression and anxiety were reportedly higher among EC users. Impulsive behaviors, reported as impulsivity, were also found to be correlated with the adoption of EC use. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the impact of EC use on mental health outcomes in children. This umbrella review highlights the urgent need to further explore the effects of current EC use from a psychiatric and public health perspective.",2023,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/47e9234f998f9455066dc4237fbce8eddbf454a6,47e9234f998f9455066dc4237fbce8eddbf454a6,"[{'authorId': '84738957', 'name': 'A.

The following terms were utilized: ‘rural health’ AND ‘telehealth’ AND ‘covid-19’. Separate searches were completed for the three included countries: ‘United States’, ‘Canada’, and ‘Mexico’. PubMed and Google Scholar were utilized. 
Results: The literature search revealed 1197 articles published in English between 1st January 2019 and 31st August 2022. One hundred and fifty articles were included in the review including 135 from the United States, 12 from Canada, and 10 from Mexico. Some articles were cross-collaborations between two of these countries. Among these papers, 18% (27) focused on telemedicine for mental health treatments, 14.7% (22) focused on oncology or cancer, 11.3% (17) focused on telemedicine for the veteran subpopulation, 2.7% (4) used a mixed methods approach, and 14% (21) used a qualitative approach. 
Conclusion: This scoping review reveals that the current literature on telehealth in rural areas during the COVID-19 pandemic is largely descriptive. There were only a few publications that focused on comparative health outcomes using telehealth in urban and rural populations in close proximity to each other. Telehealth is well represented in published literature on inequities and innovation, but there is still limited data on health outcomes and comparisons that can be drawn cross-nationally. Further studies should aim to study longer term health outcomes for those in rural areas using telehealth as opposed to areas where telehealth interventions have not yet been adopted",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27a710e85964fb1a9653caf26af02d6ee6f5a358,27a710e85964fb1a9653caf26af02d6ee6f5a358,"[{'authorId': '2239173541', 'name': 'Magda Wojtara'}]"

Pest categorisation of Euzophera semifuneralis,"Abstract The EFSA Panel on Plant Health performed a pest categorisation of Euzophera semifuneralis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), the American plum borer for the EU. This insect is native to North America, reported from the United States, Canada and Mexico. Out of its native range it is only present in Türkiye. It has not been reported in the EU and is not listed in Annex II of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. It can complete from one up to three generations per year in its native range and is polyphagous, feeding on 22 genera in 16 plant families. Host plant species commonly found in the EU include black walnut (Juglans nigra), mulberry (Morus alba, M. nigra), olive (Olea europaea), almond (Prunus dulcis), apricot (P. armeniaca), peach (P. persica), plum (P. domestica), sweet cherry (P. avium), apple (Malus domestica), pear (Pyrus communis) and pomegranate (Punica granatum). E. semifuneralis is generally known as pest of trees affected by mechanical injuries, frost or canker diseases. The pest is also known to vector the fungus Ceratocystis fimbriata which is not known to occur in the EU. Climatic conditions and availability of host plants in some EU countries would allow this species to establish and spread. Impact in cultivated hosts including apples, plums, mulberries, almond, olive and ornamental broadleaf trees is anticipated. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of entry and spread. E. semifuneralis meets the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e55277fde2869bed1e5fb625dbd53d5828d37efb,e55277fde2869bed1e5fb625dbd53d5828d37efb,"[{'authorId': '46280193', 'name': 'C.

"Health, economic growth, and Gini index in North America using a panel model","Objective: The objective of this paper is assessed the nexus among health status, economic growth, and the Gini index in North America and its countries using a panel model.
Materials and Method: The materials consist of annual data regarding life expectancy, government health expenditure as percentage of the gross domestic product, Gini index, and gross domestic product at constant 2015 US$ for the period 2000-2019. The method applies a panel model for North America and its three countries: Canada, Mexico and The United States. North America diversity treatment among countries is dealt with fixed and random effects.
Results: North America inhabitants health status are negatively influenced by an increasing income inequality, and a reduction on economic growth. The country that expends more in health care is The United States, follow by Canada and Mexico. The biggest reduction on life expectancy from an increase in income inequality is in The United States, followed by Canada and Mexico. Life expectancy increases when Canada and The United States experience economic growth. The countries with inarticulate health policy responses to an increase in income inequality are first Mexico followed by The United States.
Conclusions: In North America and its countries an increasing income inequality reduces life expectancy, and government health expenditure. Economic growth benefits life expectancy and government health expenditure. Health status seems to improve with a reduction in income inequality and a greater public health expenditure. Therefore, policies that increases income inequality and reduces public health expenditure seems to be advocates of a reduction: in health status, population welfare and economic growth.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6aaf16557890393b4a4c050474f7338b5e8bd92a,6aaf16557890393b4a4c050474f7338b5e8bd92a,"[{'authorId': '1423332712', 'name': 'R.

The relationship between parent's self-reported exposure to food marketing and child and parental purchasing and consumption outcomes in five countries: findings from the International Food Policy Study,"Abstract Food and beverage marketing influences children's food preferences and dietary intake. Children's diets are also heavily influenced by their family environment. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between parent's self-reported exposure to unhealthy food marketing and a range of outcomes related to children's desire for and intake of unhealthy foods and beverages. The study also sought to examine whether these outcomes varied across different countries. The analysed data are from the International Food Policy Study and were collected in 2018 using an online survey. The sample included 5764 parents of children under 18, living in Australia, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, or the United States. Binary logistic regressions assessed the link between the number of parental exposure locations and children's requests for and parental purchases of unhealthy foods. Generalized ordinal regression gauged the relationship between the number of exposure locations and children's consumption of such items. Interaction terms tested if these associations varied by country. Parental exposure to unhealthy food marketing was positively associated with parents reporting child purchase requests and purchase outcomes; and differed by country. Increased parental exposure to unhealthy food marketing was associated with slightly lower odds of children's weekly consumption of unhealthy foods, and this association varied by country. In conclusion, parental report of a greater range of food marketing exposure was associated with a range of outcomes that would increase children's exposure to unhealthy food products or their marketing. Governments should consider developing more comprehensive restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy foods.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b655a1f8989a2a13fdb7ad3a7deecf0b99c1f478,b655a1f8989a2a13fdb7ad3a7deecf0b99c1f478,"[{'authorId': '2186529795', 'name': 'Julia Soares Guimarães'}, {'authorId': '7749861', 'name': 'Elise Pauzé'}, {'authorId': '8471090', 'name': 'Monique Potvin Kent'}, {'authorId': '2250747960', 'name': 'Simón Barquera'}, {'authorId': '2267685699', 'name': 'Alejandra Jáuregui'}, {'authorId': '2250746091', 'name': 'Gary Sacks'}, {'authorId': '4808531', 'name': 'L.

Impact of COVID-19 on Food Security and Health,"Ecology of Food and Nutrition (EFN) promotes scholarly discussion and engagement on the holistic and cross-cultural dimensions of food and nutrition. Articles published in this journal focus on foods and food systems in terms of their utilization to satisfy human nutritional needs and improve health and well-being. The journal also publishes articles that examine how ecological, social, and cultural factors influence food availability, choices, and consumption, food cultures, and nutrition. Only a handful of journals publish articles that explicitly address the intersections of food and nutrition, biology and culture, and policy and practice from a holistic and global perspective. It is this kind of scholarship that EFN seeks to promote. The current issue of EFN includes six articles based on studies conducted in Canada, Mexico, Turkey, and the United States. These articles focus on a range of topics, including the relationship between stress and food consumption, impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food availability and stress, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and edible plant diversity. The article by Alexiuk and colleagues focuses on food and nutritional insecurity among newcomer youth in Manitoba, Canada. The authors collected cross-sectional data using an online survey on food intake, eating behaviors, and self-reported health status among 1,347 youth. This is one of the few studies in Canada to directly ask youth about their experiences of food insecurity. It concludes that food security by itself is not enough for optimal health. Nutritional security plays a critical role in optimal health. Based on these findings, the authors advocate for practical-based educational programs in schools focusing on healthy cooking and eating. The COVID-19 pandemic caused food insecurity and hunger among millions of people around the world. To prevent the spread of the disease, several strategies – physical distancing, school closures, lockdowns, etc. – were mandated. These mandates excacerbated food and nutritional challenges that households with food insecurity were already facing. The article by Bradley describes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food access in Buffalo, New York – a region in the United States with significant food insecurity. The author used data collected through surveys and qualitative interviews with users of food pantries to understand their experiences with food insecurity during the peak time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors argue that effective emergency food responses should also focus on other barriers, including transportation, stigma, and chronic poverty in households facing chronic food insecurity.

Nationalism and National Identity in North America,"Abstract The study of nationalism in North America has focused heavily on national identity. Much of the scholarship in the region indicates that most individuals define their respective national identities as attainable and inclusive. In contrast to these findings, other evidence from nationalism and ethnic politics scholarship in North America suggests a strong racial link to national understandings. Focusing on national identity research in North America, primarily the United States, but also findings from Canada and Mexico, I try to address the connection between national identity, its political effects, and the boundaries of national identity content.

One Health Spread of 16S Ribosomal RNA Methyltransferase-Harboring Gram-Negative Bacterial Genomes: An Overview of the Americas,"Aminoglycoside antimicrobials remain valuable therapeutic options, but their effectiveness has been threatened by the production of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA methyltransferases (16S-RMTases). In this study, we evaluated the genomic epidemiology of 16S-RMTase genes among Gram-negative bacteria circulating in the American continent. A total of 4877 16S-RMTase sequences were identified mainly in Enterobacterales and nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli isolated from humans, animals, foods, and the environment during 1931–2023. Most of the sequences identified were found in the United States, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico, and the prevalence of 16S-RMTase genes have increased in the last five years (2018–2022). The three species most frequently carrying 16S-RMTase genes were Acinetobacter baummannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. The armA gene was the most prevalent, but other 16S-RMTase genes (e.g., rmtB, rmtE, and rmtF) could be emerging backstage. More than 90% of 16S-RMTase sequences in the Americas were found in North American countries, and although the 16S-RMTase genes were less prevalent in Central and South American countries, these findings may be underestimations due to limited genomic data. Therefore, whole-genome sequence-based studies focusing on aminoglycoside resistance using a One Health approach in low- and middle-income countries should be encouraged.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3c26c9c41985c58aac8c59769319235813b8b021,3c26c9c41985c58aac8c59769319235813b8b021,"[{'authorId': '96643893', 'name': 'F.

Child dental neglect and legal protections: a compendium of briefs from policy reviews in 26 countries and a special administrative region of China,"Background Child neglect is a public health, human rights, and social problem, with potentially devastating and costly consequences. The aim of this study was to: (1) summarize the oral health profile of children across the globe; (2) provide a brief overview of legal instruments that can offer children protection from dental neglect; and (3) discuss the effectiveness of these legal instruments. Methods We summarized and highlighted the caries profile and status of implementation of legislation on child dental neglect for 26 countries representing the World Health Organization regions: five countries in Africa (Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Zimbabwe), eight in the Americas (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Unites States of America, Uruguay), six in the Eastern Mediterranean (Egypt, Iran, Libya, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia), four in Europe (Italy, Latvia, Serbia, United Kingdom), two in South-East Asia (India and Indonesia) and one country (China) with its special administrative region (Hong Kong) in the Western Pacific. Results Twenty-five of the 26 countries have legal instruments to address child neglect. Only two (8.0%) of these 25 countries had specific legal instruments on child dental neglect. Although child neglect laws can be interpreted to establish a case of child dental neglect, the latter may be difficult to establish in countries where governments have not addressed barriers that limit children's access to oral healthcare. Where there are specific legal instruments to address child dental neglect, a supportive social ecosystem has also been built to facilitate children's access to oral healthcare. A supportive legal environment, however, does not seem to confer extra protection against risks for untreated dental caries. Conclusions The institution of specific country-level legislation on child dental neglect may not significantly reduce the national prevalence of untreated caries in children.

Neglected ecological and health risks associated with the use of diclofenac in veterinary medicine: A mini-review,"There is sufficient scientific evidence to support that residues of diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administered to livestock raised in the open, can cause fatal renal crystallization in vultures' species, and perhaps other birds such as eagles, if treated animals enter the trophic chain. This phenomenon caused the population of vultures to decline sharply, on the brink of extinction, in India, Pakistan, Tibet, and many countries in the Middle East. For this reason, except for Spain, this medication has been prohibited for veterinary use in the rest of Europe, the United States of America, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and many other countries. In contrast, in Latin America, diclofenac is available for veterinary use in various preparations alone or combined with antibacterial drugs. The precise impact this is generating on the native species of vultures and other birds that feed on animals that die in open pastures and are not incinerated is unknown. Given the nature of our livestock production via small producers and extensive farming, most animals medicated with this NSAID can enter the natural food chain and become part of the vulture diet. Most researchers who have studied this ecological problem have recommended that countries adhere to the precautionary principle of prohibiting its sale until there is concrete evidence of the magnitude of the damage that the permissive use of diclofenac in veterinary medicine may cause in Latin America. In Mexico, the official standard NOM-064-ZOO-2000, Lineamientos para la clasificación y prescripción de los productos farmacéuticos veterinarios por el nivel de riesgo de sus ingredientes activos, recommends incinerating animals treated with diclofenac, a command that does not fit our daily reality. The question is: shall Latin American countries remain inactive despite a hitherto invisible ecological disaster? Research in Latin America needs to be carried out that supports or rejects the possible impact of diclofenac on wild species, including vultures. However, many countries on the continent, including Mexico, have adhered to the 11th Declaration of Rio for Sustainable Development in the 21st century. Based on this, we propose that action should be taken without delay to avoid or limit an ecological disaster by banning diclofenac in veterinary medicine.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7f500cbb11cf062fb206ce3b5b8a298eb5084bcc,7f500cbb11cf062fb206ce3b5b8a298eb5084bcc,"[{'authorId': '79435693', 'name': 'L.

Cooperación transfronteriza yoeme: por la defensa de sus derechos humanos de territorio y agua,"This article analyzes the strategies of cross-border cooperation that the Yoeme community (also called “Yaquis”) in Sonora, Mexico, carries out with the support of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Tucson, Arizona, United States, for the strengthening of their autonomous rights. This paper employs an interdisciplinary methodology, using observation, interviews, and documentary analysis techniques. The results reveal a cross-border collaboration of the Yoeme group in the form of legal, cultural, and economic alliances that have allowed them to create new international spaces to demand justice and strengthen their collective ties. It is concluded that such collaboration must be based on their traditional and cultural normative framework supported by international human rights instruments to strengthen their autonomous rights of territory and water. The main limitation was the restricted access to Yaqui groups due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Online information and availability of three doping substances (anabolic agents) in sports: role of pharmacies,"Background: The Internet has become an important source for easy access to doping substances, where people and athletes may acquire, outside pharmacies and without a (medical) prescription. These online websites do not always offer quality-assured products, and are outside the regular distribution channels of medicines. The aim of this study was to estimate the availability and accessible information on the Internet about the sale of three doping substances (oxandrolone, DHEA, androstenedione). Methods: Cross-sectional exploratory study, being an observation at a point in time of the online availability of these three doping substances (WADA S1 category: anabolic agents), purchased from Spain, Puerto Rico, Canada, United States, Ukraine and Russia. The characteristics of the websites, the countries the webs sold to, the pharmaceutical forms offered and the recommendations for its use were analyzed by using a computer tool designed ad hoc. Results: There were significant differences between countries in the number of webpages that sold the products (Chi-square test, p < 0.05). Oxandrolone was available for purchase mainly when buying from Spain (27.12%) and Ukraine (26.58%), in websites dedicated to sports (77.26%). For DHEA, most of the pages offered it if the search was done from Canada (23.34%) and Russia (21.44%). Products containing androstenedione or DHEA are claimed to enhance sports performance or for sports use without providing details. Compared to the total number of websites checked, the proportion of pharmacies offering these products was low, ranging from 4.86% for DHEA to 15.79% for androstenedione. Conclusion: The three substances selected are easily available without control through the Internet. Only a small number of websites offering them were online pharmacies, and requested a prescription. Most of the doping substances are purchased from the country where they are requested. Product information described benefits for sports performance, but did not do the same with their side effects. It would be advisable for these products to be sold through pharmacies, to guarantee their quality and provide evidence-based information on their safe use, benefits and risks, and only with a prescription.

Men's Perspectives on Gender Relations in the Outdoor Education Field: Furthering the Case for a Hybrid Masculinity,"Background: Scholarship has demonstrated the influence of hegemonic masculine norms on values and practices in outdoor adventure education. However, recent publications indicate that men outdoor leaders may be increasingly aware of gender biases and consequently changing their practice. To date, few publications have considered men outdoor leaders’ understanding of masculinity in the field and how it affects their practice and professional interactions. Purpose: This study critically examined multiple aspects of gender relations from men outdoor leaders’ perspectives to determine if observed changes in some men's practice signal changes toward a more equitable understanding of masculinity or merely a pivot to maintain the status quo. Methodology/Approach: A single-embedded case study methodology was employed. Interview, observation, and artifact data were collected from 18 men outdoor adventure education leaders across the United States and Canada. Findings/Conclusions: Participants noted awareness of gender inequity and articulated some strategies employed to combat sexism, particularly those associated with gendered student expectations. However, multiple participants also demonstrated gendered blind spots and supported gender hierarchy. Implications: Participants’ demonstrated awareness of gender issues, but the considerable blind spots identified in the data indicate a troubling lack of critical self-reflection and provide support for dominant hybrid masculinity.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cb4b2c4410fcb5c89c48e3607d864dbc69243151,cb4b2c4410fcb5c89c48e3607d864dbc69243151,"[{'authorId': '118577166', 'name': 'J.

Economic and Long-Term Impacts of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with the U.S.A,"In the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, United States has continued to enforce trade agreements with many countries through the World Trade Organization (WTO), with 14 of the 20 countries being active participants in these agreements. Free trade agreements (FTAs) have grown in importance as essential trade agreements that facilitate trade negotiations among member countries. These FTAs could have a wide range of positive effects, including the ability to strengthen a country's overall economy and open new economic opportunities. Whether they support or oppose trade agreements, economists can agree that they are good for the economy. Trade agreements, in a brief, are the ""rules of the road"" that guide American companies on how to do international business while simultaneously defending American interests and utilizing international trade regulations. According to recent data, the US has continued to enter trade deals with several other countries, including the UK, Mexico, and Canada. One of the most important trade agreements for the US in recent years is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) provides a crucial framework for commercial relations with these neighboring nations. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), two other recent trade deals, intended to improve trade ties between countries in the Pacific Rim and the European Union, respectively. Businesses in the United States can sign a variety of trade agreements, including Free Trade Agreements, Agreements with the World Trade Organization, Suspension Agreements, Bilateral Investment Treaties, Agreements on Intellectual Property Rights, Trade Agreement Guides, and the Florence Agreement Program.

KIBS spillovers in the knowledge production function of manufacturing and services sub-sectors at the USMCA countries,"In this paper, the knowledge production function is estimated by regressing R&D knowledge spillovers, capital investment and labor productivity on innovation generation, variable measured as filled patents, in the manufacturing and services sectors of each one of the three countries that integrate the USMCA Agreement (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement). The results state that direct and indirect spillovers of KIBS R&D expenses, reinforced by capital investment and labor productivity measures, have a significative influence on the number of patents filled by each country over the years analyzed on those sub-sectors of the USMCA economy. That positive and causal effect generates knowledge production value chains from KIBS consultancies to the manufacturing and the services subsectors and backwards therefore reinforcing the value creation system of those services; also, by promoting the development of new goods and services by innovating in the production or administrative processes of the enterprises immerse on those subsectors (the embodied effect). The conclusions could serve as basis for the analysis of the sectorial policies that have to be stipulated by the conjunction of the politicians of the three countries, in the institutions already been established by the USMCA agreement in recent years.

The rising influence of ex-region fundamentals on Asian LNG prices,"The step change in liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand, given Europe’s pivot from Russian gas, has led to a scramble for volumes and a return to a long-term view on LNG supply. But even with the near-term focus on Europe, the sustained opportunity for LNG continues to remain in Asia, where we expect more than 440 Mtpa of demand in 2030. Given the urgency, Asian buyers and portfolio players with positions in Asia have rushed to the country with the scale of over 100 Mtpa of new supply available within this decade: the United States, setting the scene for the rising influence of Henry Hub prices in Asian LNG. We discuss how LNG pricing and liquidity in Asia continues to develop through 2030, with oil-indexation waning slowly and the increasing presence of Henry Hub-indexed volumes, which could make up to a third of Asian LNG imports in that year. We also anticipate the advent of the Permian’s Waha and Canada’s AECO in Asian LNG as Mexico and Canada begin exports to Asia later this decade. We conclude that the virtuous cycle of liquidity required to create an Asian LNG hub has likely been delayed, with short-term prices governed by European fundamentals and long-term prices increasingly by US fundamentals. For Australian LNG producers, this means both spot and term prices present substantial upside potential through 2030, with the deficit in Europe providing short-term upside and the geographical distance of alternative US supply providing long-term upside.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7f6032716d75de3afacecbb93cd9d409fea7012c,7f6032716d75de3afacecbb93cd9d409fea7012c,"[{'authorId': '2157042971', 'name': 'K.

Analysis of Factors Influencing Energy Intensity in G20 Countries,"Aims: The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Industry Value Added (IVA), Urban Population (UP), Trade, and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on Energy Intensity in G20 countries. 
Study Design:  This research used a quantitative descriptive method using panel data analysis. 
Place and Duration of Study: The scope of this research extends to G20 member countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, European Union, France, United Kingdom, Indonesia, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Rusia, Saudi Arabia, Turki, United States, and South Africa, between 1990-2021. 
Methodology: This research uses descriptive method combined with panel data analysis, analyze determine of GDP, IVA, UP, Trade, and FDI on Energy Intensity in G20 countries. Furthermore, the data uses is secondary data that has a regression model on panel data from 1990-2021. 
Results: The result of this research show that IVA has a positive relationship and has a significant effect on increasing energy intensity in G20 countries. GDP, Trade and UP variables have a negative relationship and have a significant effect on Energy Intensity in G20 countries. Meanwhile, the FDI variable has no significant effect on Energy Intensity in G20 countries. 
Conclusion: Based on research result, Energy Intensity in G20 countries is influenced by various factors, The IVA factor has a positive and significant relationship with energy intensity, can be utilized to increase productivity and economic growth, but need to be balanced with effort to increase energy efficiency. 
While the GDP, Trade and Urban Population factors have a negative and significant relationship to energy intensity.

Human Rights in Graphic Life Narrative,"Surveying print and digital graphic life narratives about migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, this book investigates how comics and graphic novels witness human rights transgressions in contemporary Anglophone culture and how they can promote social justice. With thought given to how the graphic form can offer a powerful counterpoint to the legal, humanitarian and media discourses that dehumanise the most violated and dispossessed, but also how these works by western creatives may unconsciously reproduce Western neo-colonial presentations of the ‘other,’ Olga Michael focuses on gender, childhood and space within works from the United States, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Palestine, the United Kingdom, Syria, Italy, France, Niger, South Africa, Libya and Sri Lanka. Combining the familiar with the lesser-known, this book covers the work of Thi Bui’s Best We Could Do, Mia Kirshner’s I Live Here, Francesca Sanna’s The Journey, Safda Ahmed’s Villawood: Notes from an Immigration Detention Centre and the works of Joe Sacco.
 Interdisciplinary in its consideration of life writing, comics and human rights studies, and comparative in approach, this book explores such topics as including the aesthetics of visualised suffering; spatial articulations of human rights violations; the occurrence of violations whilst crossing borders; the gendered dimensions of visually-captured violence; and how human rights discourses intersect with graphic depictions of the dead. In so doing, Michael establishes how to read human rights and social justice comics in relation to an escalating global crisis and deftly complicates negotiations of ‘otherness’ in discussions surrounding refugees and migration.

Breast Cancer Screening in Latin America: The Challenge to Move from Opportunistic to Organized-Systematic Screening,"Background: Breast cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer among women in Latin America. Most Latin American countries started national mammogram screening programs a decade ago. The implementation level and effects of screening programs in Latin America have not been evaluated. Aim: To evaluate the association between screening programs implementation and breast cancer mortality in selected North American and European countries compared to a group of Latin American countries with national screening programs. Methods: The study applied an ecological design with secondary data from official national and international sources. Join point regression analysis was conducted to describe the trends in mortality rates in a group of five Latin American countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico) with five Non-Latin American countries (Canada, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom and the United States of America). The association between screening and mortality rates was explored using correlation and linear regression. National cancer plans were assessed to describe screening strategies among selected countries. Results: A significant reduction in standardized breast cancer mortality rates was observed in all Non-Latin American countries with an Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) of -2.00 (p<.05, 95%CI [-3.33, -0.70]) for the period 2010-2020. In contrast, Latin American countries reported a significant increase in the AAPC of +1.38 (p<.05, 95%CI [0.86,1.76]) in breast cancer mortality rates for the period 2010-2020. For Latin American countries, with screening rates below 50%, there was no correlation between screening and mortality rates for the period 1985-2020 (r = -0.17, p = .78). For non-Latin American countries, with screening rates over 70%, the linear regression model explained significantly 55% of the variance in mortality rates (R2aj =.55, F (5,14) = 5.69, p = .005), with a negative and significant effect of mammogram screening on mortality rates (β = -0.14, p = .01). The National Plans analysis revealed an opportunistic screening model for Latin American countries and an organized-systematic model in Non-Latin American countries. Conclusion: There is an association between the level of implementation of screening programs and mortality rates from breast cancer.

Te borders with Mexico and Canada changed and helped to defne the emerging United States, including the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867 and the expansion to Hawaii. American geographical, cultural, and literary identity was shifing while those other bordering identities, including Mexican and Canadian, were also shifing. Indigenous, African, European, Asian, and other identities were part of this story.

Why a large‐scale monsoon does not exist in North America: Orographic effects,"To understand why a large‐scale monsoon does not exist in North America, we performed a series of sensitivity simulations to investigate orographic effects of the Rocky Mountains (RMs) using the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.1. Results show that the height of the RMs plays a fundamental role in shaping the monsoon over North America that is confined to a small area from northwestern Mexico to the southwestern United States. When the RMs' height is increased by five times their actual height, a larger part of the non‐monsoon region over North America becomes a monsoon region. The mechanical effects of the RMs uplift dominate in winter, while thermal effects dominate in summer. During winter the mechanical effects induce an equivalent barotropic atmospheric response in the troposphere. With the uplift of the RMs, the ridge and trough located on the western and eastern sides of Canada are strengthened. Most areas of North America are influenced by the northerlies during winter such that enhanced descending motion over the eastern RMs favours a dry winter climate. However, thermal effects dominate during summer through enhanced baroclinic atmospheric responses. The Mexico high and lower‐level cyclonic circulation are strengthened with the RMs uplift, triggering large‐scale ascending motion. Eastern North America is mainly controlled by the enhanced southerly wind along the western flank of the North Atlantic subtropical high. Thus, the enhanced water‐vapour transport and upward motion on the eastern side of the RMs increase summer precipitation. As a result, an obvious seasonal variation with the feature of ‘dry winter and wet summer’ finally develops, indicating that the height of the RMs plays a crucial role in shaping the monsoon over the central United States. Additional experiments show that the base area of the RMs has little effect on the large‐scale monsoon formation over North America.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff0591e33e0184a646c65c61a5a4cef5ef80c1f2,ff0591e33e0184a646c65c61a5a4cef5ef80c1f2,"[{'authorId': '2219518108', 'name': 'Ruyan Qin'}, {'authorId': '2142752031', 'name': 'Hongli Chen'}, {'authorId': '46485418', 'name': 'Haiming Xu'}, {'authorId': '51100206', 'name': 'Jiechun Deng'}, {'authorId': '145502226', 'name': 'Jing Ma'}, {'authorId': '2219247693', 'name': 'Mei Hu'}]"

"Identity, migration, and social media: Generation Z in USMCA","Abstract Purpose This research analyzes national identity representations held by Generation Z youth living in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) countries. In addition, it aims to identify the information on these issues that they are exposed to through social media. Methods A qualitative approach carried out through in-depth interviews was selected for the study. The objective is to reconstruct social meaning and the social representation system. The constant comparative method was used for the information analysis, backed by the NVivo program. Findings National identity perceptions of the adolescents interviewed are positive in terms of their own groups, very favorable regarding Canadians, and unfavorable vis-à-vis Americans. Furthermore, the interviewees agreed that social media have influenced their desire to travel or migrate, and if considering migrating, they have also provided advice as to which country they might go to. On another point, Mexicans are quite familiar with the Treaty; Americans are split between those who know something about it and those who have no information whatsoever; whereas Canadians know nothing about it. This reflects a possible way to improve information generated and spread by social media. Practical implications The results could improve our understanding of how young people interpret the information circulating in social media and what representations are constructed about national identities. We believe this research can be replicated in other countries. Social implications We might consider that the representations Generation Z has about the national identities of these three countries and what it means to migrate could have an impact on the democratic life of each nation and, in turn, on the relationship among the three USMCA partners. Originality/value As one of the few studies carried out on USMCA national identities and by qualitatively exploring the representations that Generation Zers have about them, it may provide information that could contribute to expanding understanding among the citizens of the region.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca36c38375e60b02ff38c048a78c1384d1a566f6,ca36c38375e60b02ff38c048a78c1384d1a566f6,"[{'authorId': '2160800372', 'name': 'Diana L.

Gender inequity and COVID-19 vaccination policies for pregnant women in the Americas,"The region of the Americas has been the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic’s worst outcome in terms of number of deaths due to COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and the postpartum period has been found to be associated with increased risk of mortality and severe disease. Several Latin American and Caribbean countries have disproportionally high maternal mortality rates due to COVID-19. Although this region achieved relatively high vaccination rates among the general adult population, there were differing restrictions regarding the vaccination of those who were pregnant. In a pandemic, policies reflect political priorities in responses to the threats posed to populations and play an important role in promoting gender equity. This paper reports the results of an ethical analysis of 45 national COVID-19 vaccination public policies from seven countries – Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and United States. The analysis drew on reproductive justice and feminist bioethics frameworks, paying close attention to whether and how gender and social and economic inequities were addressed. It found that exclusionary approaches in immunization policies which restricted access to vaccination during pregnancy were often justified on the basis of a lack of evidence about the effects of immunization of pregnant persons, and on the grounds of medical expertise, to the detriment of women’s autonomy and agency. As such these policies reiterate patriarchal moral understandings of women, pregnancy and motherhood. In practice, they counter human rights gender equity and equality principles, and became lethal, particularly to racialized women in Latin America. During an emerging lethal disease, policies and policy development must consider the intersection of oppressive structures to protect and guarantee rights of women, girls, and pregnant persons.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9f398dbb6278c6177dd0e45c269b32d1a20be1da,9f398dbb6278c6177dd0e45c269b32d1a20be1da,"[{'authorId': '49490176', 'name': 'Ilana Ambrogi'}, {'authorId': '98056525', 'name': 'Luciana Brito'}, {'authorId': '2142813463', 'name': 'Arbel Griner'}, {'authorId': '49073208', 'name': 'S.

The Mineralogy of the Black Hawk Arsenide 5-Element Deposit,"The unusual arsenide five-element-vein deposits of the Black Hawk district in the Burro Mountains, Grant County, New Mexico is one of only a few examples of these types of deposits in the United States. These are unusual deposits due to their scarcity, unusual metal association, and uncommon mineral textures. The typical metal assemblage consists of silver-nickel-cobalt-arsenic-bismuth mineralization, with varying amounts of uranium, copper, antimony, mercury, and zinc. These deposits have been long produced for high grades of silver, and more recently cobalt, nickel, and bismuth, but they are not well studied. The Black Hawk deposits appear to be late Cretaceous in age, and occur within faults of Proterozoic granites, diorites, and metamorphics. Production from the Black Hawk district from 1881-1960 amounts to 1,286,000 oz Ag, 3,000 lbs. Cu, 1,000 oz Au, 4,000 lbs. Pb, and minor tungsten and fluorite. The mineralogical and textural relationships are very similar to those observed from the 5-element system in Cobalt, Ontario, Canada. These include early precipitation of dendritic and skeletal native silver, followed by nickel and cobalt arsenides, such as nickeline, skutterudite, nickelskutterudite, safflorite, and rammelsbergite. This is followed by a sulfide stage and precipitation of minor base metals, such as galena, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite. The last minerals to precipitate are gangue minerals, typically calcite or siderite, with some quartz. The Black Hawk district shows early uraninite precipitation, whereas the Cobalt, Ontario system shows no such uranium mineralization. This assembly of highly reduced metallic phases indicates a reducing agent component to precipitation, and it is theorized that methane or other organic fluids could have caused this rapid crystallization, leading to the development of the observed dendritic and uneven vein filling mineral",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bab9482039663adc9911bb40e676e8c4a5b0c2cc,bab9482039663adc9911bb40e676e8c4a5b0c2cc,"[{'authorId': '2183437823', 'name': 'Jakob Newcomer'}, {'authorId': '152342353', 'name': 'V.

AI-Based Currency Exchange and Identification Model,"American tourism is a multi-million dollar market. In 2022 alone, 80.7 million Americans traveled outside the United States of America. Since most of the destinations where American tourists travel, such as Mexico, Europe, and Canada, do not use U.S. currency, American tourists are subject to unnecessary stress due to this economic difference. There is a need for an identification system to classify different types of currency to aid in the American tourist’s travel experience. The proposed AI method collaborates with an online currency exchange rate database to update the rate of exchange for each currency to the US dollar in real-time.

DETERMINANTS OF USMCA COMPETITIVE FORCE FORMATION,"Understanding the factors that influence the formation of the competitive force within the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is crucial for delineating the features that contribute to the effective functioning and development of its economic competitive landscape. The primary objective of this article is to examine the impact of the interplay between determinants influencing the global competitiveness of member states and international integration groupings on the sustainable economic growth of the USMCA. The article introduces the author's conceptual framework, which presents a comprehensive classification of determinants that shape and enhance the adaptive competitiveness of integrated economic systems. This framework, alternatively referred to as the interpretation of the drivers of the USMCA's global competitiveness, applies to any international integration grouping. The proposed approach advocates the separation of the USMCA's development model as an independent entity, distinct from the model that governs the global competitiveness of individual member states. Notable differences have been identified by evaluating several determinants, including economic performance, government efficiency, business efficiency and infrastructure, on the formation of the global competitiveness of member states within the USMCA. The member states of the USMCA show significant differences in their global competitiveness. It is worth mentioning that the criterion of economic performance stands out as the most influential factor, with all three member states performing better in terms of competitiveness on this criterion. The study's findings underscore that the USMCA's competitiveness is a key feature of its economy. It is evident through the cumulative, synergistic effect of the pooling of global competitive forces among the member states. This amalgamation strengthens the USMCA's position in the global economy. Assessing the global competitiveness of the USMCA is important for delineating the development trajectories of member states within the international integration grouping. It is crucial for the design of a coherent competitiveness policy and the promotion of intergovernmental and inter-union dialogue.

"4 Urinary Fluoride Levels and Metal Co-Exposures Among Pregnant Women in Los Angeles, California","Objective: Approximately 73% of the United States (US) population on public water systems receives fluoridated water for tooth decay prevention. In Los Angeles (LA) County, 89% of cities are at least partially fluoridated. Drinking water is the primary source of fluoride exposure in the US. Studies conducted in Mexico and Canada suggest that prenatal fluoride exposure, at levels relevant to the US, may contribute to poorer neurodevelopment in offspring. However, data on biomarkers and patterns of fluoride exposure among US pregnant women are scarce. This study examined urinary fluoride levels according to sociodemographic factors and metal co-exposures among pregnant women in the US. Participants and Methods: Participants were from the Maternal and Developmental Risks from Environmental and Social Stressors (MADRES) cohort based in Los Angeles, California. There were 293 and 490 women with urine fluoride measured during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy, respectively. An intra-class correlation coefficient examined consistency of specific gravity-adjusted maternal urinary fluoride (MUFsg) between trimesters. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests examined associations of MUFsg with sociodemographic variables. Spearman correlations examined associations of MUFsg with blood and urine metals within and between trimesters. A False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction accounted for multiple comparisons. The criterion for statistical significance was an alpha of 0.05. Results: Participants were approximately 29 years old on average, and 80% were Hispanic or Latina. Median (IQR) MUFsg during trimesters one and three was 0.65 (0.5) mg/L and 0.8 (0.59) mg/L, respectively. MUFsg levels were moderately consistent between trimesters (N=292, ICC = 0.46, 95%CI: 0.32,0.57). Maternal age was positively associated with MUFsg during first (p = 0.16, p = 0.006) and third (p = 0.18, p < 0.001) trimesters. MUFsg differed by race/ethnicity during first and third trimesters (N = 293, H (3) = 7.99, p = 0.046; N = 486, H (3) = 25.31, p < 0.001, respectively). Specifically, MUFsg was higher for White, Non-Hispanic participants (first trimester Median (IQR) =1.03 (1.31) mg/L; third trimester Median (IQR) = 1.32 (1.24) mg/L) than for Hispanic participants in both trimesters (first trimester Median (IQR) =0.64 (0.48) mg/L; third trimester Median (IQR) = 0.76 (0.55) mg/L). Additionally, during trimester three, MUFsg was higher for White, Non-Hispanic participants than for Black Non-Hispanic participants (Median (IQR) = 0.82 (0.49) mg/L). MUFsg also differed by education during trimester one (N = 293, H (4) = 10.61, p = 0.031), and was higher for participants with some graduate training than for those with high school or some college/technical school education (ps = 0.03 and 0.04, respectively). After FDR correction, MUFsg was associated with blood lead (N =91, p = 0.29, p = 0.024) and urinary cadmium (N =279, p = 0.19, p = 0.042), copper (N=279, p = 0.16, p = 0.042), and tungsten (N=279, p = 0.16, p = 0.049) during trimester three. Conclusions: Consistent with studies conducted in Canada and Mexico, MUFsg increased across pregnancy. Lower MUFsg among Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black participants may reflect lower tap water consumption. Metal co-exposures are important to consider when examining potential neurodevelopmental impacts of fluoride.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dfc45c2fe4ddf95c942c7d779098ffa5bbd489ac,dfc45c2fe4ddf95c942c7d779098ffa5bbd489ac,"[{'authorId': '2275237216', 'name': 'Meaghan Hall'}, {'authorId': '2261489701', 'name': 'Ashley J Malin'}, {'authorId': '2255555169', 'name': 'Howard Hu'}, {'authorId': '1397994872', 'name': 'E.

Typification of Mexican Euphorbia (Euphorbiaceae),"Euphorbia is one of the largest genera of flowering plants, and Mexico is one of the primary centers of diversification. Much work remains before a thorough understanding of the Mexican species is reached, and the present contribution aims to unambiguously allow the application of 14 names by clarifying their types. Some of these are distributed outside of Mexico, including Canada, the United States, Central America, South America, and the Antilles. Lectotypes of the following names are designated: E. biformis, E. boliviana, E. elastica, E. gumaroi, E. lancifolia, E. luciismithii, E. macropus, E. mendezii, E. potosina, E. subreniformis, and E. umbellulata. In the absence of original material, neotypes are selected for the following names: E. nudiflora, E. tanquahuete, and E. vermiculata. All the names are currently accepted, except for E. elastica (=E. tanquahuete) and E. biformis (=E. macropus).

Evaluating Genetic Variability and Biometric Indicators in Bread Wheat Varieties: Implications for Modern Selection Methods,"Major grain-producing countries such as Canada, the United States of America, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, China, India, Turkey, and Russia, in the direction of selection for the creation of new varieties of wheat resistant to abiotic factors, are paying great attention to creating new wheat varieties by developing new genotypes by identifying donors with high-quality and positive indicators of valuable economic traits and introducing them into modern selection methods. Progress has been made in this direction worldwide. Today, many varieties of wheat with valuable economic traits and high grain quality have been created and introduced to large areas. In this study, 23 genotypes were selected from 45 genotypes of bread wheat varieties and lines. The nursery’s growth period lasted between 233-238 days, and the lines appeared more mature than the local check varieties. Compared to the local check varieties, among the plant’s biometric indicators, 15 lines showed positive results in terms of plant height, 10 lines in peduncle length, 5 lines in spike length, 1 line in spike number, and 1 line in resistance to lodging. The statistical analysis of grain yield and grain quality using the Dospekhov method  showed that the experimental error rates for various indices as follows: 0.888% for yield, 3.018% for weight of 1000 grains, 0.627% for Test weight, 2.028% for protein content, 1.519% for gluten content, 2.001% for IDK, and 4.01% for grain glassiness. It was noted that the experiment was conducted correctly in terms of repetitions and showed a positive result. 10 genotypes with yield of genotypes 72.6-96.7 c/ha, weight of 1000 grains 37.9-43.2 g, test weight 803-835 g/l, protein content 16.2-19.3%, gluten content 28.5-30.4% were selected. Accordingly, it was observed that the amount of iron was 1.0-1.8 mg. It was observed that the sample was 1.3 mg in the Gozgon variety and 1.4 mg in the Antonina variety.

The Increasing Role of Technology in Teaching and Learning Activities in Higher Education,"We are pleased to publish the second regular issue (Volume 13, Issue 2) of Higher Learning Research Communications (HLRC) for 2023. If there is a common theme that emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is the increased role that technology did and will continue to play in teaching and learning activities in tertiary education. The range of articles reflects the interest in digital teaching and learning and includes the use of scaffolded simulations, the influence of immersive virtual reality in the classroom, and gamification. In addition, guidelines around instant messaging are proposed that should continue the conversation around the ethical use of technology in teaching and learning.

“Reading like a Poet” between the Lines of the Cultural Exemption and the Mexican Exception,"In REMEX: Toward an Art History of the NAFTA Era, I argue that the North American Free Trade Agreement/ Tratado de Comercio Libre del América del Norte/ Accord de libreéchange nord-américain (NAFTA/ TLCAN/ ALÉNA), billed as a trilateral agreement to eliminate continental trade barriers between Canada, the United States, and Mexico, represented the most fantastical inter-American social allegory of the late twentieth century.1 Although NAFTA technically went into effect one minute after midnight on January 1, 1994, the continent’s NAFTAfication encompassed the treaty’s contentious negotiation, signing, ratification, and the fifteen years of its implementation from 1994 to 2008. Because the agreement unfolded in the wake of Mexico’s 1984 Faustian pact with the World Bank, wherein Mexico was granted a loan in exchange for its adoption of significant neoliberal reforms, NAFTA’S asymmetrical effects were anticipated: Mexico’s “economic penetration” and US exceptionalism were treated as paired foregone conclusions. Objections to the treaty subsequently assumed distinct shapes in the two nation-states.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/396a65f84c68037f3093bfe012eaef88f0b86433,396a65f84c68037f3093bfe012eaef88f0b86433,"[{'authorId': '47434775', 'name': 'A.

Analysis of Economic Growth on Carbon Dioxide Gas Emissions in G20 Countries,"Aims: The purpose of this research is to analyze the effect of GDP, GFCF, and urban population on carbon dioxide gas emissions. In this case, the member countries of the G20 are the group of countries responsible for 75% of the greenhouse gas emissions produced. The role of the G20 countries is needed in reducing the resulting carbon dioxide gas emissions, to prevent global warming or climate change. 
Study Design: This study used a quantitative descriptive method. 
Place and Duration of Study: The scope of this research is the member countries of the G20 such as Indonesia, South Africa, United States, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, India, United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, Germany, Canada, South Korea, Mexico, France, Russia, and Turkiye, European Union with Time Period 2000-2019. 
Methodology: This study uses a descriptive method with a quantitative approach, namely to analyze and determine the effect of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Gross Fixed Capital   Formation (GFCF), and urban population (URB) on carbon dioxide gas emissions in the G20 countries. Furthermore, the data used is secondary data with a panel data regression model, namely a combination of time series data and cross sections starting from 2000-2019. 
Results: The results of this study indicate that GDP, GFCF and urban population have a positive and significant effect on increasing carbon dioxide gas emissions in G20 member countries. 
Conclusion: Based on the calculation results, it is found that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), and urban population (URB) in G20 member countries have a positive and significant effect on increasing carbon dioxide gas emissions, both in partial and simultaneous tests.

A Comparative Study of the RCEP and the USMCA from the Perspective of International Political Economy: Based on the Analysis of Digital Trade Rulemaking,"Reginal Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) are both emerging free trade agreements, covering the major economies in East Asia and North America respectively. After screening, 24 papers were selected to do a comparative study of RCEP and USMCA. The paper applies the interdependence theory and the dependency theory in the field of international political economy to interpret the logic of rulemaking of the two FTAs. For the RCEP, the key is the growing interdependence (with increasing trade volumes and growing economic gains) between ASEAN countries and other member states. In addition, economic complementarity also influences the interdependence between the ASEAN and other states in East Asia, reinforcing their willingness to deepen this relationship. For the USMCA, the key is the dependency relationship between the U.S. and Mexico. This dependency continues to this day due to the untouchable structural power of the United States, and still forces Mexico to submit to the U.S. willingness to set rules for the USMCA. This paper innovatively introduces theories from the field of international political economy to study the rulemaking of the new FTAs, which provides certain directions for future academic research in the related fields.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ce9895ddcbb8f1ad900dc26b6ae3c6813400c33,0ce9895ddcbb8f1ad900dc26b6ae3c6813400c33,"[{'authorId': '145906066', 'name': 'Yang Chen'}]"
To What Degree and through Which Channel Do Central Banks Other Than the Federal Reserve Cause Spillovers?,": Spillovers play a crucial role in driving monetary policy around the world. The literature focuses predominantly on spillovers from the Federal Reserve. Less attention has been paid to spillovers from other central banks. I measure the degree to which 20 central banks cause spillovers. I show that central banks in medium-to high-income countries cause spillovers to medium-to long-term interest rates in similar countries through a bond-pricing channel. These effects are narrower than spillovers from the Federal Reserve, which also affect emerging markets, short-term interest rates, and other assets. However, they are still pronounced. Fourteen central banks other than the Federal Reserve cause significant spillovers: the central banks of Australia, Canada, Czechia, the eurozone, Japan, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Consequently, the Federal Reserve causes only one-fifth of the spillovers to 10-year interest rates, and the United States is the recipient of large spillovers. My results imply that central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, are affected by greater spillovers than is commonly believed, and that non-Fed central banks cause spillovers through a bond-pricing channel.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/325bc77c40e5f7a047eb451efdf304f6eed3adb8,325bc77c40e5f7a047eb451efdf304f6eed3adb8,"[{'authorId': '2068430318', 'name': 'Christopher D.

Evaluating western North Pacific tropical cyclone forecast in the subseasonal to seasonal prediction project database,"The Daily Tropical Cyclone Probability (DTCP), defined as the probability of tropical cyclone occurrence within 500 km of a location in 1 day, is proposed and used in evaluating subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) predictions from the subseasonal to seasonal Prediction Project Database, from May 1 to October 31, 1999 to 2010. The ensemble forecasts are collected from eleven operational centers, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), China Meteorological Administration (CMA), Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Hydrometeorological Centre of Russia (HMCR), the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate of the National Research Council of Italy (ISAC), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), Météo-France/Centre National de Recherche Meteorologiques (METFR), the United States National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), and the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO). In both observation and these eleven forecast models, the daily tropical cyclone probability is modulated by the Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation (BSISO), depicted by the two indices, boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation 1 and boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation 2. During boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation 1 phases 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8, the daily tropical cyclone probability in the western North Pacific region is ∼3.5 times higher. Similarly, during phases 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 of boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation 2, the daily tropical cyclone probability is ∼2.5 times higher. Among the eleven models, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model best reproduces the climatological daily tropical cyclone probability and its modulation by the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation in the western North Pacific region, followed by the United States National Centers for Environmental Prediction, the Korea Meteorological Administration, the Japan Meteorological Agency models. Using the daily tropical cyclone probability metric, the highest debiased Brier Skill Score of the eleven models is from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which has a slightly less skillful prediction than the reference climatological forecast with lead time 11–30 days. The skill of the eleven models is higher during the non-active phases of tropical cyclone activity than their skill during the active phases.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d62cd06dab0b4d59a682e1f901b254300714a86,0d62cd06dab0b4d59a682e1f901b254300714a86,"[{'authorId': '47119578', 'name': 'Xiaochun Wang'}, {'authorId': '145236240', 'name': 'D.

North American Powassan virus encompasses diverse in vitro phenotypes,"Powassan virus (POWV) is a tick-borne flavivirus which has resulted in increasing human cases over the past two decades. Despite high prevalence in ticks and evidence of broad distribution in North America, fewer than 50 human cases are detected annually with evidence of undetected asymptomatic infections. Experimental studies of the relationships between POWV genetic diversity and disease potential are currently lacking. In the present study, sixteen isolates originating from 13 locations in the United States and Canada were used to assess in vitro phenotypic diversity in human neuronal cells. Broad differences in replication and cytopathic ability were observed between isolates, even amongst those in the same sublineage. In vitro phenotype was not associated with geographic or temporal location and could not be associated with specific genotypes. These results support the observation that the North American POWV population may be highly genetically and phenotypically diverse.

"Policy innovation through local, sustainable development evaluation","The global political agenda has included some high-profile environmental summits over the past few months. Three of these events stand out. The 2022 United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, was held from 6–20 November 2022.

Of these three events, the Biodiversity Summit made the most impact as delegates committed to protecting 30% of land and 30% of coastal and marine areas by 2030. This pledge is remarkable because it re-establishes political commitments to protect biodiversity, which is a key component of climate action. At the same time, many observers of the summit questioned how nation-states will implement this goal. Like the SDGs, the “30 by 30” commitment is long on aspirations but short on operationalization details.

Distribution changes of the toxic mushroom Amanita phalloides under climate change scenarios and its potential risk over indigenous communities in Mexico,"Amanita phalloides is a native European deathly ectomycorrhizal mushroom that was introduced to North America and has been expanding its distribution during the last decades. This species is morphologically similar to wild edible mushrooms and if its distribution expands to Mexico, it could represent a risk in terms of food security for local communities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential climatic suitability that exists for A. phalloides in North America and overlay it with the distribution of mycophilic communities in Mexico under a baseline climatic scenario and climate change scenarios. To find climatic suitability we modeled its potential distribution with the algorithm that had the best predictive power after pilot test (MaxEnt) using species presences and eight climatic variables chosen with biological and statistical criteria. We worked with CanESM5 because it is one of the best models to simulate climate in North America and SSP5-8.5 scenario in order to be consistent with the precautionary principle. Our results suggest that even when the species has not yet been registered in Mexico, when using European records to model, this country presents 33.61% of climatic suitability for this species under the baseline scenario, potentially affecting about 70% of indigenous communities which are the main consumers of edible mushrooms. Under climate change scenarios, an increase in climatic suitability is expected in Mexico, while decreases are expected in United States and Canada. When using North American records to model, almost no climatic suitability is found in Mexico; however, the implementation of warning campaigns in Mexico is still needed.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c355060516bbaa0fe4d9cbb35908961c3f44e76d,c355060516bbaa0fe4d9cbb35908961c3f44e76d,"[{'authorId': '2248018443', 'name': 'Abril Villagrán-Vázquez'}, {'authorId': '2267806400', 'name': 'R.

Evaluation of Flow Units and Capillary Pressures of the Giant Chicontepec Tight Oil Paleochannel in Mexico and a Fresh Look at Drilling and Completions,"
 The Chicontepec Paleochannel is a giant shaly sandstone reservoir(s) with volumes of OOIP ranging between 137 and 59 billion STB (Guzman, 2019), which has been equated recently to the Permian Basin. However, the oil recoveries are very small, ranging between 0.32 to 0.75% of the OOIP. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate flow units and capillary pressures of Chicontepec, as well as drilling and completion methods, with a view to improve the characterization of the reservoir(s) and, thus, oil recoveries.
 Current cumulative oil production of Chicontepec is 440.38 million STB. Although it is a significant volume, it represents a very small percent recovery from the reservoir (0.32 to 0.75% of the OOIP). To help improving recovery, a method is developed for characterizing the tight Chicontepec paleochannel using flow units and capillary pressures. Like in the case of many tight unconventional reservoirs, the capillary pressures can go to very high values, reaching 55,000 psi in the Chicontepec case. Therefore, a special procedure is developed to generate a consistent interpretation of all the available capillary pressure curves for the entire range of pressures.
 Results highlight the important oil recovery potential of the Chicontepec Paleochannel (Misantla-Tampico Basin), which has been equated recently to the Permian Basin in the United States and has been termed by Guzman (2022) ""a premier super-basin in waiting."" The assessment is supported by quantitative formation evaluation work performed by Gutierrez Oseguera and Aguilera (2022). Although natural fractures are present, most wells must be hydraulically fractured to achieve commercial success.
 Process or delivery speed (the ratio of permeability and porosity) for the Chicontepec samples used in the capillary pressure experimental work range between 159.1 md and 0.17 md (porosity in the denominator is a fraction). Flow units show pore throat apertures (rp35) ranging from less than 0.1 microns to about 4.5 microns. These values and flow units compare well with data available for prolific unconventional reservoirs such as the Cardium sandstone in Canada and the giant Permian Basin in the United States. The radius rp35 refers to pore throat aperture at 35% cumulative pore volume.
 The novelty of this study is the development of a consistent procedure for interpreting the entire range of pressures measured during mercury injection capillary pressures. Such pressures go up to 55,000 psi for the core samples considered in this study. The integration with flow units and formation evaluation suggests that the potential of the Chicontepec unconventional reservoirs can rival successful results obtained in the Cardium sandstone and the Permian Basin. Some ideas are advanced regarding drilling and completion for Chicontepec based on the results of the present study and production success in the Permian Basin.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/37c395b88b01bba81bf32970fbe51c1e565a1296,37c395b88b01bba81bf32970fbe51c1e565a1296,"[{'authorId': '2158693396', 'name': 'Alejandra Gutierrez Oseguera'}, {'authorId': '79298122', 'name': 'R.

Scarcity of research on psychological or psychiatric states using validated questionnaires in low- and middle-income countries: A ChatGPT-assisted bibliometric analysis and national case study on some psychometric properties,"Background It is vital to assess whether research on psychological or psychiatric states using validated questionnaires is still lagging in low- and middle-income countries and to what degree, and to continue to assess the psychometric properties of the most informative questionnaires. Methods We performed a bibliometric analysis of Web of Science Core Collection for all years to determine the number of studies performed in each country that used an inventory or a questionnaire on aggression, anxiety, depression, borderline personality, narcissism, self-harm, shame, or childhood trauma. We conducted a simple observational analysis of distributions by countries to derive the main overall conclusions, assisted by ChatGPT to test its ability to summarise and interpret this type of information. We also carried out a study in Croatia to examine some psychometric properties of five commonly used questionnaires, using Cronbach’s α coefficient and zero-order correlations. Results We observed a concentration of research activity in a few high-income countries, primarily the United States and several European nations, suggesting a robust research infrastructure and a strong emphasis on studying psychological and psychiatric states within their population. In contrast, low- and middle-income countries were notably under-represented in research on psychological and psychiatric states, although the gap seems to be closing in some countries. Turkey, Iran, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, India, Malaysia and Pakistan have been consistently contributing an increasing number of studies and catching up with the most research-intensive high-income countries. The national case study in Croatia confirmed adequate psychometric properties of the most frequently used questionnaires. Conclusions Addressing research gaps in low- and middle-income countries is crucial, because relying solely on research from high-income countries may not fully capture the nuances of psychological and psychiatric states within diverse populations. To bridge this gap, it is essential to prioritise mental health research in low-resource settings, provide training and resources to local researchers, and establish international collaborations. Such efforts can lead to the development of culturally valid questionnaires, an improved understanding of psychological and psychiatric states in diverse contexts, and the creation of effective interventions to promote mental well-being on a global scale.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e08079b77a3d5faf7229b43cd92eb07bba54ded6,e08079b77a3d5faf7229b43cd92eb07bba54ded6,"[{'authorId': '5840473', 'name': 'D.

Role of Resilience in the Psychological Recovery of Women With Acute Myocardial Infarction,"Background Psychological well‐being is important among individuals with myocardial infarction (MI) given the clear links between stress, depression, and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Stress and depressive disorders are more prevalent in women than men after MI. Resilience may protect against stress and depressive disorders after a traumatic event. Longitudinal data are lacking in populations post MI. We examined the role of resilience in the psychological recovery of women post MI, over time. Methods and Results We analyzed a sample from a longitudinal observational multicenter study (United States, Canada) of women post MI, between 2016 and 2020. Perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale‐4 [PSS‐4]) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire‐2 [PHQ‐2]) were assessed at baseline (time of MI) and 2 months post MI. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and resilience (Brief Resilience Scale [BRS]) were collected at baseline. Low and normal/high resilience groups were established as per published cutoffs (BRS scores <3 or ≥3). Mixed‐effects modeling was used to examine associations between resilience and psychological recovery over 2 months. The sample included 449 women, mean (SD) age, 62.2 (13.2) years, of whom 61.1% identified as non‐Hispanic White, 18.5% as non‐Hispanic Black, and 15.4% as Hispanic/Latina. Twenty‐three percent had low resilience. The low resilience group had significantly higher PSS‐4 and PHQ‐2 scores than the normal/high resilience group at all time points. In adjusted models, both groups showed a decrease in PSS‐4 scores over time. Conclusions In a diverse cohort of women post MI, higher resilience is associated with better psychological recovery over time. Future work should focus on developing strategies to strengthen resilience and improve psychological well‐being for women with MI.

Measuring and assessing subnational electoral democracy: a new dataset for the Americas and India,"ABSTRACT Assessing how democracy varies within countries is paramount to the subnational turn in comparative politics. Despite recent contributions, we still lack a comparable measure of democracy for provinces inside countries. To overcome this limitation, I present the Index of Subnational Electoral Democracy (ISED), a measure that tracks the electoral dimension of democracy across the provinces of nine Latin American countries, the United States, Canada, and India for a period of roughly 40 years, making it the largest dataset on subnational regime outcomes to date. I then use the ISED to assess the democratic trajectories of Argentinian, Brazilian, Mexican, and Indian states, revealing that: 1) Indian provinces have been, on average, more democratic than their Latin American counterparts. 2) The relative position of provincial regimes within these countries has been remarkably stable over time. 3) Most subnational units in the Americas have had “low intensity” regimes. 4) Subnational regime hybridity has been the norm rather than the exception, and that 5) for the Latin American cases under consideration, democracy and development are positively connected at the local level. I conclude by outlining the ISED's research applications and reflecting on the implications of these five conclusions for future research on subnational democracy.",2023,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4f7b200e5f7a414db1d945a409fcf8d3c36edf4,f4f7b200e5f7a414db1d945a409fcf8d3c36edf4,"[{'authorId': '2130107433', 'name': 'Javier Pérez Sandoval'}]"
Preventing Type 2 Diabetes With Vitamin D: Therapy Versus Supplementation,"V itamin D supplementation and vitamin D therapy are often conflated. Because of the notion that “more is better” (1), many healthy adults take vitamin D at higher doses than are required (2, 3). The need for vitamin D supplementation in the healthy population is determined by modeling total vitamin D intake from all sources—natural foods, fortified foods, and dermal synthesis—in conjunction with interpreting vitamin D status bymeasuring the circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-[OH]D) concentration (1). Multidisciplinary groups with expertise in vitamin D nutrition advise governments about vitamin D intake requirements and safe limits of intake in the population. The 2011 Institute of Medicine report for the United States and Canada, “Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D,” introduced a paradigm of vitamin D intake as a probability distribution: The estimated average requirement (EAR) meets the needs of about 50% of the healthy population, and the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) meets the needs of at least 97.5% of the population (1). On the basis of skeletal health indicators (rickets and osteomalacia), the 2011 report specified that the EAR for vitamin D was 10 mcg (400 IU) daily, corresponding to a 25-(OH)D concentration of 40 nmol/L (16 ng/mL), and that the RDA was 15 mcg (600 IU) daily, corresponding to a 25-(OH)D concentration of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL). A definition of vitamin D status using 25-(OH)D thresholds arose from this report, with less than 30 nmol/L (<12 ng/mL) indicating “risk of deficiency,” 30 to 50 nmol/L indicating “risk of inadequacy,” greater than 50 nmol/L indicating “sufficiency,” and greater than 125 nmol/L (>50 ng/mL) indicating “risk of harm” (1). European government agencies, including the Nordic Council of Ministers, the European Food Safety Authority, the U.K. Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, have adopted similar positions (4). The tolerable upper intake level (UL), which is the highest level of daily vitamin D intake that carries no appreciable risk for adverse health effects, is set by all government agencies at 100 mcg (4000 IU). This corresponds to a 25-(OH)D level above 125 nmol/L (1). The UL is derived from the “no observed adverse effect level” (NOAEL) of 250mcg (10000 IU) daily. Because the NOAEL is a toxicity threshold, it is not an appropriate basis for setting a UL; therefore, a safety margin (an uncertainty factor of 2.5) was applied (1, 5). Two recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) using 250 mcg of vitamin D daily for 1 to 3 years in adults showed increased risk for hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria (6, 7), which indicates that the NOAEL is lower than 250 mcg daily. Thus, the UL should be lower. The UL is not a target intake, being 10-fold higher than the EAR (1). Numerous noncommunicable diseases have been related to “vitamin D deficiency” in observational studies, but many associations can likely be explained by reverse causation (1). To date, RCTs providing vitamin D in daily doses exceeding the RDA or as occasional boluses have reported no benefits for cancer, cardiovascular disease, fractures, bone mineral density, falls, type 2 diabetes, infant growth, infant bone mineral content, or childhood asthma (2). Conversely, a meta-analysis of aggregate data from RCTs about prevention of acute respiratory infections showed that protection was associated with daily vitamin D supplementation of 10 to 25 mcg (400 to 1000 IU), which is close to recommended population health intakes (8). The STURDY (Study To Understand Fall Reduction and Vitamin D in You) trial on fall prevention in frail older adults, which used 4 daily doses of vitamin D ranging from 5 to 100 mcg (200 to 4000 IU), raised safety concerns about daily vitamin D doses of 25mcg or greater, including higher risk for a first serious fall (9). In their article, Pittas and colleagues report on a meta-analysis using individual participant data from 3 RCTs about preventing type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes: the Tromsø study (n= 511), which studied vitamin D at a dose of 500 mcg (20000 IU) weekly; the vitamin D and type 2 diabetes (D2d) study (n= 2423), which studied vitamin D at a dose of 100 mcg daily; and the Diabetes Prevention with active Vitamin D (DPVD) study (n = 1256), which studied eldecalcitol (a calcitriol analogue) at a dose of 0.75 mcg daily (10). The total daily vitamin D intake in the D2d study was just above the UL. These RCTs showed nearly identical, nonsignificant reductions in diabetes risk of 10% (Tromsø), 12% (D2d), and 13% (DPVD). The meta-analysis showed that the intervention reduced diabetes risk by 12% (hazard ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.77 to 0.99]). The authors conducted a subgroup analysis of the cumulative mean intratrial 25-(OH)D level from the 2 trials that administered cholecalciferol (Tromsø and D2d). When the mean intratrial 25-(OH)D level was 125 nmol/L or greater, the risk for diabetes decreased by 76% compared with participants who maintained a mean intratrial 25-(OH)D level of 50 to 74 nmol/L (20 to 29 ng/mL) (10). This suggests that the optimal effect is above the 25-(OH)D threshold for “risk of harm” (>125 nmol/L). In their discussion, the authors transition from the domain of a new “known known” through a “known unknown” to “unknown unknowns.” As shown by their meta-analysis, the new “known known” is that high-dose vitamin D therapy can prevent type 2 diabetes (10). They speculate that the optimal effect is “near and possibly above the range of 125 to 150 nmol/L”, whereas the adverse effects of vitamin D therapy just above the UL are unknown. The “known unknown” is whether this very high dose causes hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria (7). The “unknown unknowns” are whether this very high dose causes other harms, such as falls or other adverse effects (9). What is the way forward?

Chronic Migraine Epidemiology and Outcomes – International (CaMEO-I) Study: Methods and multi-country baseline findings for diagnosis rates and care,"Background The Chronic Migraine Epidemiology and Outcomes-International study provides insight into people with migraine in multiple countries. Methods This cross-sectional, observational, web-based cohort study was conducted in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, and United States. An initial Screening Module survey solicited general healthcare information from a representative sample and identified participants with migraine based on modified International Classification of Headache Disorders-3 criteria; those with migraine completed a detailed survey based on validated migraine-specific assessments. Results Among 90,613 people who correctly completed the screening surveys, 76,121 respondents did not meet the criteria for migraine, while 14,492 did. Among respondents with migraine, mean age ranged from 40 to 42 years. The median number of monthly headache days ranged from 2.33 to 3.33 across countries, while the proportion of respondents with moderate-to-severe disability (measured by Migraine Disability Assessment) ranged from 30% (Japan) to 52% (Germany). The proportion of respondents with ≥15 monthly headache days ranged from 5.4% (France) to 9.5% (Japan).

Disproportionate impact of COVID-19 severity and mortality on hospitalized American Indian/Alaska Native patients,"Abstract Epidemiological data across the United States of America illustrate health disparities in COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality by race/ethnicity. However, limited information is available from prospective observational studies in hospitalized patients, particularly for American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations. Here, we present risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality in patients (4/2020–12/2021, n = 475) at the University of New Mexico Hospital. Data were collected on patient demographics, infection duration, laboratory measures, comorbidities, treatment(s), major clinical events, and in-hospital mortality. Severe disease was defined by COVID-related intensive care unit requirements and/or death. The cohort was stratified by self-reported race/ethnicity: AI/AN (30.7%), Hispanic (47.0%), non-Hispanic White (NHW, 18.5%), and Other (4.0%, not included in statistical comparisons). Despite similar timing of infection and comparable comorbidities, admission characteristics for AI/AN patients included younger age (P = 0.02), higher invasive mechanical ventilation requirements (P = 0.0001), and laboratory values indicative of more severe disease. Throughout hospitalization, the AI/AN group also experienced elevated invasive mechanical ventilation (P < 0.0001), shock (P = 0.01), encephalopathy (P = 0.02), and severe COVID-19 (P = 0.0002), consistent with longer hospitalization (P < 0.0001). Self-reported AI/AN race/ethnicity emerged as the highest risk factor for severe COVID-19 (OR = 3.19; 95% CI = 1.70–6.01; P = 0.0003) and was a predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR = 2.35; 95% CI = 1.12–4.92; P = 0.02). Results from this study highlight the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on hospitalized AI/AN patients, who experienced more severe illness and associated mortality, compared to Hispanic and NHW patients, even when accounting for symptom onset and comorbid conditions. These findings underscore the need for interventions and resources to address health disparities in the COVID-19 pandemic.",2023,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ccf746799bd2ebc949aee29dcc46939496faa4a,7ccf746799bd2ebc949aee29dcc46939496faa4a,"[{'authorId': '47876945', 'name': 'I.

Outcomes in Patients With COVID-19 With Acute Encephalopathy and Coma,"Background and Objectives To report the prevalence of acute encephalopathy and outcomes in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify determinants of 90-day outcomes. Methods Data from adults with severe COVID-19 and acute encephalopathy were prospectively collected for patients requiring intensive care unit management in 31 university or university-affiliated intensive care units in 6 countries (France, United States, Colombia, Spain, Mexico, and Brazil) between March and September of 2020. Acute encephalopathy was defined, as recently recommended, as subsyndromal delirium or delirium or as a comatose state in case of severely decreased level of consciousness. Logistic multivariable regression was performed to identify factors associated with 90-day outcomes. A Glasgow Outcome Scale–Extended (GOS-E) score of 1–4 was considered a poor outcome (indicating death, vegetative state, or severe disability). Results Of 4,060 patients admitted with COVID-19, 374 (9.2%) experienced acute encephalopathy at or before the intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A total of 199/345 (57.7%) patients had a poor outcome at 90-day follow-up as evaluated by the GOS-E (29 patients were lost to follow-up). On multivariable analysis, age older than 70 years (odds ratio [OR] 4.01, 95% CI 2.25–7.15), presumed fatal comorbidity (OR 3.98, 95% CI 1.68–9.44), Glasgow coma scale score <9 before/at ICU admission (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.22–3.98), vasopressor/inotrope support during ICU stay (OR 3.91, 95% CI 1.97–7.76), renal replacement therapy during ICU stay (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.21–4.50), and CNS ischemic or hemorrhagic complications as acute encephalopathy etiology (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.41–7.82) were independently associated with higher odds of poor 90-day outcome. Status epilepticus, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome were associated with lower odds of poor 90-day outcome (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03–0.83). Discussion In this observational study, we found a low prevalence of acute encephalopathy at ICU admission in patients with COVID-19. More than half of patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute encephalopathy had poor outcomes as evaluated by GOS-E. Determinants of poor 90-day outcome were dominated by older age, comorbidities, degree of impairment of consciousness before/at ICU admission, association with other organ failures, and acute encephalopathy etiology.

Determinants for thyroid hormone replacement therapy in subclinical hypothyroidism: a multicenter electronic health records-based study.,"BACKGROUND
The frequency and factors associated with thyroid hormone replacement therapy among patients with subclinical hypothyroidism remains uncertain.


METHODS
In this electronic health records-based observational cohort study, we included adults diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism from four academic centers (United States of America and Mexico) from 01/01/2016 to 12/31/2018). We aimed to identify the determinants of thyroid hormone replacement therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism and the frequency of treated subclinical hypothyroidism.


RESULTS
A total of 796 patients (65.2% women) had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 165 (20.7%) were treated with thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The treated group was younger [51.0 (SD 18.3) vs. 55.3 (SD 18.2) years, P= .008] and had a higher proportion of women (72.7% vs. 63.2%, P= .03) compared to the untreated group. Only 46.7% of patients in the treated group and 65.6% in the untreated group had confirmatory thyroid function tests before the decision to start thyroid hormone replacement therapy was made. There was no difference in the frequency of thyroid autoimmunity evaluation, but a positive thyroid autoimmunity test was more frequent in the treated group compared to the untreated group (48.2% vs. 20.3%, P= <.001). In a multivariable logistic regression model, female sex (OR=1.71, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.59, P= .01) and index thyrotropin level (OR=1.97, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.49, P= <.001 for every SD (2.75 mIU/L) change) were associated with higher odds of treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, female sex, and index thyrotropin level were associated with higher odds of treatment. Moreover, in our population, the decision to treat or not to treat subclinical hypothyroidism was often based on only one set of abnormal thyroid function tests, and thyroid autoimmunity assessment was underused.",2023,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/94b69d5dd96257c85b9a92fbaf7e8fdfe0caaa9b,94b69d5dd96257c85b9a92fbaf7e8fdfe0caaa9b,"[{'authorId': '10765817', 'name': 'F.

Satisfaction with pediatric telehealth according to the opinions of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: A literature review,"Objective To review satisfaction with telehealth among children and adolescents based on their own opinions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In the PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase databases, we searched for peer-reviewed studies in English on satisfaction with telehealth among children and adolescents (rather than parents). Both observational studies and interventions were eligible. The review was categorized as a mini review because it focused on the limited time frame of the COVID-19 pandemic. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Reviewers extracted information from each study and assessed risk of bias. Results A total of 14 studies were eligible. Studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, Italy, Israel, Poland, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They focused on a variety of health conditions. Two of the 14 studies were interventions. Participants expressed high satisfaction with video and telephone visits and home telemonitoring while also preferring a combination of in-person visits and telehealth services. Factors associated with higher satisfaction with telehealth included greater distance from the medical center, older age, and lower anxiety when using telehealth. In qualitative studies, preferred telehealth features among participants included: a stable Internet connection and anonymity and privacy during telehealth visits. Conclusion Telehealth services received favorable satisfaction ratings by children and adolescents. Randomized-controlled trials on the effectiveness of pediatric telehealth services compared to non-telehealth services may assess improvements in satisfaction and health outcomes.",2023,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a9682a4aa2729126baac18aba07882f1ae2539c,2a9682a4aa2729126baac18aba07882f1ae2539c,"[{'authorId': '50327595', 'name': 'G.

Stigma Against Patients With Substance Use Disorders Among Health Care Professionals and Trainees and Stigma-Reducing Interventions: A Systematic Review,"Abstract Purpose In this systematic review, the authors examine the prevalence and extent of stigmatizing attitudes among health care professionals (HCPs) and trainees against patients with substance use disorders (SUDs), including research on interventions to reduce stigma. Method The authors searched 7 databases for articles published from January 1, 2011, through February 15, 2023, that quantified SUD stigma among HCPs or trainees. Inclusion criteria allowed both observational and intervention studies from the United States or Canada to be included in this review. Quality assessment was applied to all included studies; studies were not excluded based on quality. Results A total of 1,992 unique articles were identified of which 32 articles (17 observational studies and 15 intervention studies), all conducted in the United States, met the inclusion criteria. Half of the included studies (16 of 32) were published in 2020 or later. Most of the intervention studies (13 of 15) used a single-group pre-post design; interventions involved didactics and/or interactions with persons with SUDs. The 32 included studies used a total of 19 different measures of stigma. All 17 observational studies showed some degree of HCP or trainee stigma against patients with SUDs. Most intervention studies (12 of 15) found small but statistically significant reductions in stigma after intervention. Conclusions SUD stigma exists among HCPs and trainees. Some interventions to reduce this stigma had positive impacts, but future studies with larger, diverse participants and comparison groups are needed. Heterogeneity among studies and stigma measures limits the ability to interpret results across studies. Future rigorous research is needed to determine validated, consensus measures of SUD stigma among HCPs and trainees, identify stigma scores that are associated with clinical outcomes, and develop effective antistigma interventions for HCPs and trainees.",2023,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d02f3274208203fdc5e681cb36be58b5385b3122,d02f3274208203fdc5e681cb36be58b5385b3122,"[{'authorId': '2179338387', 'name': 'Elizabeth Magnan'}, {'authorId': '12668557', 'name': 'Meghan S.

Thresholds of liminality: discourse and embodiment from separation to consummation among Guatemalan Maya youth workers in Los Angeles,"Abstract This paper brings contemporary scholarship on youth migration, Indigeneity, race, and language into conversation with formative work on liminality and rites of passage. Drawing on six years’ worth of participant observation and interviews with L1 Maya (primarily K’iche’) speaking Guatemalan youth workers in Los Angeles, we theorize the transformations that characterize urban immigrant life for Indigenous Latinxs in the contemporary United States as a passage through the liminal state from separation to consummation. We first analyze participants’ language behavior during the separation phase following migration, when youth sought to defend themselves from anti-Indigenous harm and discrimination through discourse practices such as cloaking or denying Maya proficiency, claiming to be Mexican or non-Indigenous Guatemalan, or avoiding speaking Spanish or K’iche’ in public. Participants also employed techniques of bodily concealment that were believed to make them less racially identifiable in physical terms. As time went on, youth felt less of a need to defend themselves from stigmas attached to Indigeneity and Guatemalan identity and began to consider possibilities for expressing ethnic and linguistic pride in communal settings. This reflection was enabled by youth’s growing embeddedness in Los Angeles’s multicultural society along with coethnic small group settings that valorized Indigeneity and invited youth to compare their trajectories to those of other immigrant groups. We acknowledge the distinctive challenges that Indigenous youth encounter as immigrants to the US. However, our findings point beyond Indigenous Latinxs’ post-migration experiences of shame, fear, and discrimination to possibilities for language maintenance and cultural pride in the context of long-term sobrevivencia, or survival, in diaspora.",2023,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e111a0b58d881ecc761f9df397c7c38355910eab,e111a0b58d881ecc761f9df397c7c38355910eab,"[{'authorId': '1404472657', 'name': 'B.

"Notes on adult feeding and behavior of Tegrodera aloga Skinner, 1903 (Coleoptera: Meloidae)","species, T. aloga Skinner, 1903 (Figs. 1–2), T. erosa LeConte, 1851 and T. latecincta Horn, 1891, which are found in the southwestern United States and adjoining northwestern Mexico. These three species are mostly geographically separate but are very closely related and distinguished from one another only by a combination of variable adult traits (Pinto 1975a). The range of T. aloga is primarily central to southern Arizona, with scattered records in western Arizona, extreme southeastern California and Sonora, Mexico. We here summarize the known agricultural impacts, behavior, and biology of this species and report new plant feeding records and notes from our observations. Tegrodera aloga causes occasional agricultural problems. The first reported pestiferous event in Arizona was in 1914, where “they were observed to attack the foliage of young fruit trees in addition to alfalfa” (Morrill 1914:33, reported there under the older concept of T. erosa). Again, in 1930, the beetles were noted to have defoliated unspecified vegetable crops after migrating from the surrounding desert into agricultural fields (Lebert 1931:60, reported under the name T. latecincta). Tegrodera aloga was further reported to feed on alfalfa from museum specimen labels from southeastern California and central Arizona as well as from sugar beet crops (Pinto 1975a:49). Most recently, a number of reports emerged in 2015 of T. aloga being found in organic packaged greens, specifically packaged lettuce, spinach, and salad in both Canada and the United States (Anonymous 2015, Northrup 2015). Many Nearctic species within the family of Meloidae are known to be parasites of solitary ground dwelling bees (Erickson et al. 1976). Tegrodera aloga is presumed to be such a parasite of bee nests, though no direct observations in the wild have yet been published. Triungulin (first-instar) and first-grub phase larvae have been reared from captive adults, but the subsequent coarctate larval stage was not successfully reared to pupation (Erickson & Werner 1974). The triungulin larva was described by Erickson (1973). Erickson & Werner (1974) reported that the triungulin instar lasts only 2–3 days before it molts into the first-grub phase which occupies instars 2–5. During this latter phase, the larvae fed on pollen balls created by bees. Erickson & Werner (1974) offered larvae of several bee species as food to T. aloga larvae, but none were consumed. This may indicate that T. aloga feeds only on pollen ball stores of ground nesting bees, but the failure to rear larvae all the way through to the adult stage may alternatively indicate that some other specific food source is required. Erickson & Werner (1974) concluded from their study that consuming bee larvae was not critical to the development of T. aloga, at least during the feeding instars, but moisture level within the rearing chambers and composition of the food mattered greatly. Species within Tegrodera have a unique courtship behavior among meloids, associated with their morphology, where the male and female face one another and the male begins stroking the female’s antennae with his own while moving her antennae in Scientific Note",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d939da4f9a2e40850a71a44deb0a894ab45038d2,d939da4f9a2e40850a71a44deb0a894ab45038d2,"[{'authorId': '2221158886', 'name': 'Ethan R.

The changing epidemiology of preterm labour and delivery: A systematic literature review,"To identify and synthesize epidemiologic data for preterm labour (PTL) and preterm birth (PTB).A systematic search, with protocol registered in PROSPERO, was implemented in MEDLINE and EMBASE and supplemented by web‐based and grey literature searches. Observational, population‐based studies in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy, published in English between 2012 and 2022 were considered for inclusion. Estimates by country were reported and stratified by gestational age, birth plurality, and race/ethnicity, data permitting.Ten publications and nine grey literature reports were included. Epidemiologic estimates of PTL were reported for the United Kingdom and France: PTL was diagnosed in 2.2% of pregnancies and preceded 50% of PTBs. PTB rates were reported for the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, and Spain. Among live births in these countries, annual PTB incidence ranged from 5.9% (Spain, 2020) to 10.2% (United States, 2019). Most countries reported the PTB incidence by gestational age; reports by birth plurality or race/ethnicity were scarce. PTB rates for Germany or Italy were not identified.While PTBs were well‐reported overall and by gestational age, how rates varied by plurality, race/ethnicity and etiology is unclear. Epidemiologic estimates for PTL, a leading cause of PTB, were rarely reported in the literature.

"Pharmacoepidemiologic study of association between apparent treatment resistant hypertension, cardiovascular disease and interaction effect by sex and age","BACKGROUND A limited number of studies have been conducted to test the magnitudes of the association between apparent treatment resistant hypertension (aTRH) and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). AIM To investigate the association between aTRH and risk of CVD and examine whether sex and age modify this association. METHODS We applied an observational analysis study design using data from the United States Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). ALLHAT recruited participants (n = 25516) from 625 primary care settings throughout the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and United States Virgin Islands, aged 55 and older with hypertension and at least one additional risk factor for heart disease. aTRH was assessed from the year 2 visit. CVD event was defined as one of the following from the year 2 follow-up visit: Fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, angina, stroke, heart failure, or peripheral artery disease. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the effect of aTRH on CVD risk. Potential modifications of sex and age on this association were examined on the multiplicative scale by interaction term and additive scale by joint effects and relative excess risk for interaction. RESULTS Of the total study participants (n = 25516), 5030 experienced a CVD event during a mean of 4.7 years follow-up. aTRH was associated with a 30% increase in risk of CVD compared to non-aTRH [hazards ratio (HR) = 1.3, 95%CI: 1.19-1.42]. Sex and age modified this relationship on both multiplicative and additive scales independently. Stratified by sex, aTRH was associated with a 64% increase in risk of CVD (HR = 1.64, 95%CI: 1.43–1.88) in women, and a 13% increase in risk of CVD (HR = 1.13, 95%CI: 1.01–1.27) in men. Stratified by age, aTRH had a stronger impact on the risk of CVD in participants aged < 65 (HR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.32–1.77) than it did in those aged ≥ 65 (HR = 1.18, 95%CI: 1.05–1.32). Significant two-way interactions of sex and aTRH, and age and aTRH on risk of CVD were observed (P < 0.05). The observed joint effect of aTRH and ages ≥ 65 years (HR = 1.85, 95%CI: 1.22–2.48) in males was less than what was expected for both additive and multiplicative models (HR = 4.10, 95%CI: 3.63–4.57 and 4.88, 95%CI: 3.66–6.31), although three-way interaction of sex, age, and aTRH on the risk of CVD and coronary heart disease did not reach a statistical significance (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION aTRH was significantly associated with an increased risk of CVD and this association was modified by both sex and age. Further studies are warranted to test these mechanisms.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05841c30e17d1df339094b97561441f09e0c5159,05841c30e17d1df339094b97561441f09e0c5159,"[{'authorId': '37943001', 'name': 'Julianne Nelson'}, {'authorId': '79596615', 'name': 'Longjian Liu'}]"
Introduction: The Rise of Asian State Actors in the Arctic,"T raditionally an isolated and low-tension region, the Arctic is known for its extraordinary beauty and pristine wilderness. The region is recognized as one of the last resource-rich frontiers—it holds 22% of the world’s oil and natural gas resources, is home to more than 21,000 known species, and contains two commercially viable shipping routes that could potentially reshape the future of international trade.1 As the sea ice over the central Arctic Ocean has long kept the region inaccessible, Arctic affairs have customarily been prioritized on the policy agendas of only the eight Arctic states—Canada, Denmark (via Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States. However, this situation has begun to change in recent decades as the region becomes more accessible due to climate change, ecological degradation, and a consequent rise in economic and geostrategic opportunities. The Arctic is now a new frontier that has piqued the interest of international actors, especially ones from the Asia-Pacific region. In 2013, at the Kiruna Ministerial Meeting in Sweden, the Arctic Council granted China, Japan, India, South Korea, and Singapore the status of observer states.2 The Arctic Council is a critical governmental forum for Arctic cooperation with decisions made by the eight Arctic nations and the permanent participants.3 Although observer members are limited to observation of the work of the council and involvement in specific working groups, prior to the Kiruna decision the council’s observer states only comprised European countries.

Asthma and pregnancy,"INTRODUCTION Asthma during pregnancy is a significant public health issue because it is one of the most potentially serious medical problems to complicate pregnancy. Studies have shown that having asthma during pregnancy puts both mother and baby at risk for complications1. Several studies indicate that pregnancies in patients with asthma are associated with an increased risk for adverse obstetric outcomes, such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, cesarean section rate, preterm birth (PB), low birth weight (LBW), and intrauterine growth restriction2. Different prevalence rates of asthma during pregnancy are described. In Canada, asthma affects only 0.43% of pregnant women, while this rate can reach 8.4% in the United States. In Brazil, although there are not many studies on the subject, it is estimated that the prevalence of asthma in this population is closer to American standards, ranging from 5 to 8%3. An observational study using secondary data from a birth cohort study in the metropolitan area of Aracaju applied a questionnaire to 4,757 women and identified that 299 had a diagnosis of asthma before or during pregnancy, corresponding to a prevalence of 6.3%4.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/471cf3c0939d7123b07590d22dbffeb6b51061cd,471cf3c0939d7123b07590d22dbffeb6b51061cd,"[{'authorId': '1401473480', 'name': 'R.

NSABP C-14: CORRECT-MRD II—Second colorectal cancer clinical validation study to predict recurrence using a circulating tumor DNA assay to detect minimal residual disease.,"TPS284 Background: Detectable ctDNA after resection of early-stage solid tumors has been associated with very high risk of recurrence, suggesting ctDNA is evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD). Several studies are ongoing to investigate the role of ctDNA in the optimal management of pts with colorectal cancer using different assay technologies. Methods: This is a prospective, observational, multicenter study in the United States and Canada of 750 patients who have undergone complete surgical resection for stage II or III colorectal cancer, who have FFPE tissue available from the primary resection sufficient for a novel bespoke MRD assay and are willing to provide serial whole blood specimens for ctDNA analysis. Participants are asked to provide study specimens after definitive surgical resection, pre-recurrence follow-up, and clinical recurrence (if applicable). Recently amended eligibility criteria include inclusion of rectal cancer patients who have completed neo-adjuvant therapy and surgical resection, as well as enrollment of all stage II and III patients regardless of microsatellite stability status. The Oncotype Colon Recurrence Score will be assessed on all patients from their surgical specimen if criteria are met for this testing. ctDNA will be analyzed with an NGS-based tumor-informed MRD assay that identifies somatic genomic alterations from DNA derived from the patient’s tumor tissue, subtracts germline variants, and detects a selected subset of tumor-specific (bespoke) ctDNA in their blood. All primary tumor specimens will undergo full exome and transcriptome sequencing using the Oncomap ExTra assay. If there is evidence of disease recurrence, the metastatic tissue will also undergo Oncomap ExTra testing, which will be shared with participants. The primary objective is to validate the association of post-definitive therapy and pre-recurrence follow-up ctDNA positivity with recurrence-free interval (RFI). Further objectives are to assess the: sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA positivity for subsequent clinical recurrence; contribution of post-surgery baseline, post-adjuvant therapy, and pre-recurrence follow-up ctDNA results on RFI; time from positive ctDNA to clinical recurrence in participants who had a positive ctDNA result; and compare the Oncotype Colon Recurrence Score estimate of 3-year recurrence risk with the observed 3-year recurrence rate. The primary analysis will use a Cox proportional hazards regression applied to the RFI with ctDNA result (positive or negative) measured at post-surgical baseline (or end of adjuvant therapy if used) and serially after that as a single, time-dependent covariate.

Growth in High-Skilled Mexican Migration Northward: American and Canadian Destinations,"As migration of university-educated Mexicans to both the United States and Canada has begun to increase, the greater opportunities Canada’s expanding points-based selection system offers for the highly skilled to become permanent residents highlights a question: which factors may induce high-skilled Mexicans to prefer Canadian destinations versus American? Using traditional migration theories to frame interviews with a volunteer sample of 40 young university-educated Mexicans, this study confirms that reasons of proximity, climate, and culture often favor American destinations, while reasons of social acceptance, social welfare, and personal security favor Canadian. Importantly, urban-specific preferences matter. Those factors favoring U.S. destinations in general lead many to prefer southern-tier U.S. cities traditional for less-skilled Mexican migration. Those considering northern U.S. cities often prefer a Canadian choice. Canadian competitiveness in the northern urban market suggests that increased awareness of Canadian immigration opportunities could significantly boost skilled Mexican migration to Canada.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ee79e9dd7e845e0c52174f5dd5c72aa265b847a,7ee79e9dd7e845e0c52174f5dd5c72aa265b847a,"[{'authorId': '75041871', 'name': 'J.

P-type Processes and Predictability: The Winter Precipitation Type Research Multiscale Experiment (WINTRE-MIX),"
During near-0°C surface conditions, diverse precipitation types (p-types) are possible, including rain, drizzle, freezing rain, freezing drizzle, ice pellets, wet snow, snow, and snow pellets. Near-0°C precipitation affects wide swaths of the United States and Canada, impacting aviation, road transportation, power generation and distribution, winter recreation, ecology, and hydrology. Fundamental challenges remain in observing, diagnosing, simulating, and forecasting near-0°C p-types, particularly during transitions and within complex terrain. Motivated by these challenges, the field phase of the Winter Precipitation Type Research Multi-scale Experiment (WINTRE-MIX) was conducted from 1 February – 15 March 2022 to better understand how multiscale processes influence the variability and predictability of p-type and amount under near-0°C surface conditions. WINTRE-MIX took place near the US / Canadian border, in northern New York and southern Quebec, a region with plentiful near-0°C precipitation influenced by terrain. During WINTRE-MIX, existing advanced mesonets in New York and Quebec were complemented by deployment of: (1) surface instruments, (2) the National Research Council Convair-580 research aircraft with W- and X-band Doppler radars and in situ cloud and aerosol instrumentation, (3) two X-band dual-polarization Doppler radars and a C-band dual-polarization Doppler radar from University of Illinois, and (4) teams collecting manual hydrometeor observations and radiosonde measurements. Eleven intensive observing periods (IOPs) were coordinated. Analysis of these WINTRE-MIX IOPs is illuminating how synoptic dynamics, mesoscale dynamics, and microscale processes combine to determine p-type and its predictability under near-0°C conditions. WINTRE-MIX research will contribute to improving nowcasts and forecasts of near-0°C precipitation through evaluation and refinement of observational diagnostics and numerical forecast models.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4817e5f0132003674e67ed4f3cc4d73304fc3472,4817e5f0132003674e67ed4f3cc4d73304fc3472,"[{'authorId': '103001136', 'name': 'J.

Fentanyl and other New Psychoactive Synthetic Opioids. Challenges to Prevention and Treatment.,"Synthetic opioids have played a significant role in the current opioid crisis in the United States (U.S.) and Canada and are a matter of concern worldwide. New psychoactive opioids (NPOs) are classified in the internationally recognized new psychoactive substances (NPSs) category. This group comprises compounds that may have been synthesized decades ago but appeared only recently in the illicit drug market. Such is the case of fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and non-fentanyl opioids. Most NPOs have effects similar to morphine, including euphoria and analgesia, and can produce fatal respiratory depression. Here, we present an overview of the systemic and molecular effects of main NPOs, their classification, and their pharmacological properties. We first review the fentanyl group of NPOs, including the four compounds of clinical use (fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil, and remifentanil) and the veterinary drug carfentanil. We also provide essential information on non-medical fentanyl analogs and other synthetic opioids such as brorphine, etonitazene, and MT-45, used as adulterants in commonly misused drugs. This paper also summarizes the scarce literature on the use of NPOs in Mexico. It concludes with a brief review of the challenges to prevention and treatment posed by NPOs and some recommendations to face them.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fbf99202ca6d9221b4e8cca1fb2b70b55264b414,fbf99202ca6d9221b4e8cca1fb2b70b55264b414,"[{'authorId': '1404548666', 'name': 'Damaris Albores-Garcia'}, {'authorId': '2066065636', 'name': 'S.

Our Checkered Past,"ABSTRACT Despite advocacy of landscape approaches in cultural resource management (CRM) and critiques of the site concept, CRM data collection methods in the western United States continue to focus on individual archaeological sites as units of observation, analysis, and management. The transect-recording unit (TRU) method strikes a balance between conventional site-based recording methods and site-less survey approaches by dividing survey space into a grid of uniformly sized cells for recording all cultural manifestations observed across a survey area. TRU survey generates site boundaries required by CRM regulations while retaining a fine-grained spatial framework for landscape-level research and management. This article discusses the technical requirements of the TRU system and its potential for improving landscape-level research and management. Advances in digital recording technologies and analysis techniques render the method efficient and effective in identifying cultural resource distributions and characteristics otherwise obscured by conventional approaches. The research and management potential of the TRU system is illustrated through identification and interpretation of precontact foot trails in New Mexico's Tularosa Basin. These trails are essentially invisible during pedestrian survey but are readily identifiable as linear patterns using aggregated landscape-scale TRU survey data from multiple survey projects, providing novel insight into precontact routes of movement and exchange.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3a0627dee502bae892ac4efd87f80b0100bf3012,3a0627dee502bae892ac4efd87f80b0100bf3012,"[{'authorId': '102148659', 'name': 'Phillip O.

COVID-19-related mortality in Texas border counties vs non-border counties,"The state of Texas ranked second in total cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States during the pandemic. Counties near the US–Mexico border were severely impacted by the pandemic. Mortality and long-term consequences from COVID-19 are associated with comorbidities, illness severity, and patient demographics. However, differences in outcomes between border and non-border counties are unknown. In this retrospective observational study, data were obtained for analysis from the Texas hospital inpatient discharge public use data file from 2020 to 2021 for adult patients with COVID-19 based on the associated international classification of disease 10 codes. Patients were categorized into border or non-border counties. The clinical outcomes included mortality, length of stay, mortality risk, illness severity, and intensive care unit (ICU) or critical care unit (CCU) admissions. Cost differences between border and non-border counties were analyzed. Age, gender, race, ethnicity, admission type, location, and year of diagnosis were covariates. A total of 1,745,312 patients were included in this analysis. 25% of COVID-19 patients admitted in Texas were from border counties. Patient mortality was 5.35% in border counties compared to 3.87% in non-border counties (p = 0.003). In border counties, 36.51% and 32.96% of patients required ICU and CCU admissions compared to 32.96% and 10.72%, respectively in non-border counties. Border counties had significantly higher risk of mortality (relative risk (RR) = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.09–1.46, p = 0.002), ICU admission (RR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.01–1.32, p = 0.038), CCU admission (RR = 2.87; 95% CI: 1.93, 4.27, p < 0.001), and ICU/CCU admission (RR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.48, p < 0.001) which reflects health disparities in the management of COVID-19 in border counties of Texas.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/88e0e01e5076cb6f2e4501422825f914e990cd18,88e0e01e5076cb6f2e4501422825f914e990cd18,"[{'authorId': '2237966068', 'name': 'Amna Obaid'}, {'authorId': '1435855363', 'name': 'Seyed Khalafi'}, {'authorId': '2144765843', 'name': 'A.

Complex Autism Spectrum Disorder: Structural Determinants of Health and Their Impact on the Diagnosis.,"CASE
Emmanuel is a 6.5-year-old boy who was referred to your evaluation clinic for concerns about his social skills and communication. He arrived in the United States (US) 1 year ago after an immigration trajectory that began in Haiti when he was aged 3 years; passed through Mexico, where the family was in various shelters for over a year; and concluded 2 years later, with the family eventually settling in an urban center in the northeastern United States. While in Mexico, the family was living in a camp without access to utilities. They faced significant food insecurity and experienced multiple relocations because of fears of physical safety.Emmanuel's native language is Haitian Creole, but he learned some Spanish during the year spent in Mexico. Now in the United States, he has been enrolled for the last year in the public school system, where he participates in an inclusion English as a Second Language kindergarten classroom. The school has expressed concern about several behaviors including bolting from the classroom, shouting out inappropriately, and taking food from other children's lunches.On initial meeting with a DBP clinician, Emmanuel's parents report that they do not have any concerns at home about his behavior, although they do feel that he ""talks less than his 3 older siblings."" The 6-person household is currently living in one-room, temporary housing; they deny current food insecurity.As part of his evaluation, you perform an Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale-2 Module 3 in English with the support of an in-person Haitian Creole interpreter. Emmanuel does not make eye contact throughout the evaluation but does respond to your questions in a combination of English and Haitian Creole. He can define the concept of a ""friend"" but cannot name one of his own friends. He is not able to engage in the demonstration task with words but does use gestures to indicate the actions involved in brushing teeth. His free play is perseverative and centers around fighting between the action figures.Brief cognitive testing reveals normal nonverbal intelligence. He is unable to decode in English on achievement testing. The family completes a Social Responsiveness Scale in English, which shows normal scores except in the repetitive behaviors section, where the family endorses pacing and some restricted interests, particularly around video games.He is not yet on an Individualized Education Plan, and there have been no formal assessments from the school except for language dominance testing indicating that his dominant language is Haitian Creole, with emerging English skills.

Dust Storms as Global Disseminators of Plant Pathogens,"This contemporary mycological inquiry investigates into the escalating threat to global food security posed by the dispersal of plant pathogens through airborne dust, exemplified by the simulation of a colossal dust storm, named “Godzilla”. Employing advanced computational models, researchers trace the route of Fusarium oxysporum spores from North Africa across the Atlantic, settling in the Caribbean and southeastern United States. The study estimates the conveyance of over 13,000 viable spores, raising concerns about their impact on agricultural regions, particularly southeastern Louisiana, Mexico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba. While ultraviolet radiation typically neutralizes airborne spores within three days, the focus shifts to spore viability upon landing in vulnerable agricultural zones. Proximity to the dust source in intercontinental regions intensifies the risk, emphasizing the need to understand fungal disease dynamics and identify susceptible agricultural areas. Global prevalence of F. oxysporum and its capacity to infect over 100 crops highlight the potential for significant crop losses and economic consequences. The research underscores the urgency of comprehending disease dissemination dynamics and protecting global food security, emphasizing regions like sub-Saharan Africa as critical sources of viable spores. The study’s preliminary nature prompts a future focus on observational data acquisition, including comprehensive dust storm mapping and genetic comparisons of F. oxysporum, to validate the model’s findings.

Constructing Visibility: Esther Born’s Photography beyond the Archives,"Esther Baum Born was an American photographer who worked in both the United States and Mexico. Beginning in the 1920s, she exhibited her work regularly in New York galleries and saw her photographs published in a broad spectrum of architectural journals. Born’s book, The New Architecture in Mexico (1937), stands as an undisputed monument to her creative insights and a respected source for cutting-edge ideas about modern building. Less well known to the scholarly community are the sensitive portraits that Born took of her own artistic milieu: Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, and Frank Lloyd Wright, to name only a few, appeared before her camera. The author argues that these images represent an area for future research. In any event, Born’s creative flourishing was largely eclipsed once she joined the highly successful architectural practice of her husband, Ernest Born. She gave up photography entirely in the 1940s to support his work.
The legacy of both Borns remains fairly well-known to students of Bay Area architecture, who have admired their contributions to public transportation (designing train stations), urban renewal (developing master planning documents), and book design (such as the Plan of St. Gall, co-authored with art historian, Walter Horn). Much of the couple’s joint career is documented in established archives throughout the United States and Canada, although it needs to be said that Ernest Born is typically given top billing for the work. Esther Born’s early efforts as a photographer sit in these archives, too. A full assessment of her legacy as a photographer waits to be written. This paper attempts to give greater visibility to her ambitions as well as to the lasting consequence of her work’s placement within the many archival situations where it can be found today.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d10e8818d1b70b16f5ac3c1f1a64273b7be4c17f,d10e8818d1b70b16f5ac3c1f1a64273b7be4c17f,"[{'authorId': '123220647', 'name': 'D.

In Australia, guidelines for drugs product recall are described under section 65F of trade practices act 1974. In Canada, it includes under section 25 of Natural Health Products Regulations (NHPR). In India it includes under para 27 and 28 of schedule M. In South Africa SAHPRA (South African Health Products Regulatory Authority) guidelines are responsible for regulations of drug product recall. Majority of drug recalls occur in the United states due to various reasons. In 2020-2022 total 257 drugs were recalled in Last three years. In Canada and Australia 220 and 25 drugs are recalled respectively. India and South Africa have recalled 2 and 21 drugs respectively.

Deep Learning Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy and Confidence Expressed on Twitter in 6 High-Income Countries: Longitudinal Observational Study,"Background An ongoing monitoring of national and subnational trajectory of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy could offer support in designing tailored policies on improving vaccine uptake. Objective We aim to track the temporal and spatial distribution of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and confidence expressed on Twitter during the entire pandemic period in major English-speaking countries. Methods We collected 5,257,385 English-language tweets regarding COVID-19 vaccination between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022, in 6 countries—the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Ireland. Transformer-based deep learning models were developed to classify each tweet as intent to accept or reject COVID-19 vaccination and the belief that COVID-19 vaccine is effective or unsafe. Sociodemographic factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and confidence in the United States were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable linear regressions. Results The 6 countries experienced similar evolving trends of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and confidence. On average, the prevalence of intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination decreased from 71.38% of 44,944 tweets in March 2020 to 34.85% of 48,167 tweets in June 2022 with fluctuations. The prevalence of believing COVID-19 vaccines to be unsafe continuously rose by 7.49 times from March 2020 (2.84% of 44,944 tweets) to June 2022 (21.27% of 48,167 tweets). COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and confidence varied by country, vaccine manufacturer, and states within a country. The democrat party and higher vaccine confidence were significantly associated with lower vaccine hesitancy across US states. Conclusions COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and confidence evolved and were influenced by the development of vaccines and viruses during the pandemic.

Impact of Sex‐ and Gender‐Related Factors on Length of Stay Following Non–ST‐Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction: A Multicountry Analysis,"Background Gender‐related factors are psycho‐socio‐cultural characteristics and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in acute myocardial infarction, independent of sex. Whether sex‐ and gender‐related factors contribute to the substantial heterogeneity in hospital length of stay (LOS) among patients with non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction remains unknown. Methods and Results This observational cohort study combined and analyzed data from the GENESIS‐PRAXY (Gender and Sex Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease: From Bench to Beyond Premature Acute Coronary Syndrome study), EVA (Endocrine Vascular Disease Approach study), and VIRGO (Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI [Acute Myocardial Infarction] Patients study) cohorts of adults hospitalized across Canada, the United States, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, and Australia for non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction. In total, 5219 participants were assessed for eligibility. Sixty‐three patients were excluded for missing LOS, and 2938 were excluded because of no non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction diagnosis. In total, 2218 participants were analyzed (66% women; mean±SD age, 48.5±7.9 years; 67.8% in the United States). Individuals with longer LOS (51%) were more likely to be White race, were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, and a lower income, and were less likely to be employed and have completed secondary education. No univariate association between sex and LOS was observed. In the adjusted multivariable model, age (0.62 d/10 y; P<0.001), unemployment (0.63 days; P=0.01), and some of countries included relative to Canada (Italy, 4.1 days; Spain, 1.7 days; and the United States, −1.0 days; all P<0.001) were independently associated with longer LOS. Medical history mediated the effect of employment on LOS. No interaction between sex and employment was observed. Longer LOS was associated with increased 12‐month all‐cause mortality. Conclusions Older age, unemployment, and country of hospitalization were independent predictors of LOS, regardless of sex. Individuals employed with non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction were more likely to experience shorter LOS.

Access and Quality of Pediatric Home Healthcare: A Systematic Review,"Despite the rising prevalence of children with medical complexity who need extensive medical care at home, the literature evaluating pediatric home healthcare has not been well summarized. Our objective was to systematically review the evidence-base of pediatric home healthcare to understand what is currently know about access and quality of home healthcare for children. Pubmed, Ovid Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Proquest Dissertations and Theses Global were searched for studies in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia English publications (1980-2020) regarding children (≤18 years) using shift-based home healthcare services. Blinded independent review was conducted followed by extraction of study characteristics including how each study examined access and/or quality, which was categorized using the National Academy of Medicine quality dimensions. Of 9533 abstracts, 101 were included. Most were US (82%) and regional (72%) studies. Half (54%) focused on home nursing followed by home services generally (43%). The majority (77%) evaluated access and patient-family centeredness (62%); their results identified consistent limitations in access and quality resulting in negative impacts on patients and families. Less than 20% of publications addressed safety, effectiveness or equity. Bias scoring found that quantitative studies were universally weak, but qualitative studies were mostly moderate or strong. Results are limited by design heterogeneity and exclusion of training research. While research in pediatric home healthcare has increased, studies remain observational and rarely evaluate quality in reproducible ways.

Effect of Polydeoxyribonucleotide on Tendon Healing and Fatty Degeneration in Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"s Journal of ISAKOS 8 (2023) S149–S164 Eva Gusnowski MSc, MD CANADA Sheila McRae PhD, MSc CANADA Panayiotis D Megaloikonomos MD GREECE Eric R. Wagner MD, MS UNITED STATES Peter B. MacDonald MD, FRCS, Dip Sport Med CANADA Summary: LTTT is a suitable salvage procedure for any degree of fatty infiltration of teres minor, and should be strongly considered as an alternate procedure to latissimus dorsi tendon transfer in patients with high grade teres minor fatty infiltration. Data: Introduction: Surgical management of massive irreparable rotator cuff tears has increasingly used salvage procedures such as tendon transfers to preserve the glenohumeral articulation in young patients. Appropriate patient selection for tendon transfers is crucial to surgical success, yet there is a paucity of evidence investigating factors that lead to improved post-operative outcomes. Success of latissimus dorsi tendon transfer has been linked to a low level of fatty infiltration of the teres minor muscle belly. However, the effect of teres minor fatty infiltration has not been studied in newer surgical techniques such as the lower trapezius tendon transfer (LTTT). This study aims to correlate post-operative outcomes of LTTT in massive irreparable rotator cuff tears to the degree of fatty infiltration of teres minor. Materials & Methods: This is a prospective longitudinal observational study. All patients with massive rotator cuff tears undergoing arthroscopic assisted LTTT (as previously described) by a single fellowship trained upper extremity surgeon were screened. The research coordinator undertook the consenting process if the patient agreed to be approached for the study. For all consented patients, fatty infiltration of teres minor was graded using the Goutallier classification based on pre-operative MRI by two orthopaedic surgeons not involved in performing the surgery. Two groups were created based on teres minor fatty infiltration: Group A included Grades 0 and 1 (no or little fatty infiltration) and Group B included Grades 2 to 4 (moderate to severe fatty infiltration). Participants completed a demographic form, and the SANE score and a satisfaction questionnaire were completed at pre-, 12and/or 24-months post-operative. At all study time points, range of motion and isometric strength of forward elevation, abduction, and external rotation (ER) in neutral and 90 abduction) using a hand-held dynamometer were measured by a research athletic therapist blind to Goutallier grade. Lag sign test was performed. Between group comparisons were performed using independent ttests assuming unequal variance and prevs post-operative comparisons were performed for each group using paired t-tests. Rate of external rotation (ER) lag sign was compared between groups using Fisher’s exact test. Significance was defined as p < 0.05. Results: Twenty-six patients met the study inclusion criteria, with 18 patients included in Group A and 8 in Group B. There were no differences between groups with respect to pre-operative SANE score, degrees of active forward elevation, and degrees of active ER. Eight of 18 patients (44.4 %) in Group A had an ER lag sign, compared to 5 of 8 patients (62.5%) in Group B, but this was not statistically significant (p 1⁄4 0.672). Significant post-operative improvements in SANE score were found in both groups with no differences between groups. Pre-operative ER strength of the affected arm with the arm adducted was significantly different in Group A (3.9kg) versus (Group B (0.58kg; p 1⁄4 0.011; Figure 1). However, ER strength was similar post-operatively (p 1⁄4 0.587). Discussion: Lower trapezius tendon transfer provides in-phase motor activity and anatomic line of pull to the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles. In our study, patients with any degree of fatty infiltration of teres minor benefited from LTTT and experienced improvement in patient reported outcomes. Patients with moderate to severe teres minor fatty infiltration (Group B) had lower baseline ER strength, but this difference was no longer evident post-operatively. Although overall patient numbers in this study are small given the rarity of this condition and procedure, these outcomes suggest that LTTT provides significant benefit to patients, independent of the degree of fatty infiltration to teres minor. This is in contrast to the latissimus dorsi tendon transfer, which is less successful in patients with moderate to severe teres minor fatty infiltration. Taken together, LTTT is a suitable salvage procedure for any degree of fatty infiltration of teres minor, and should be strongly considered as an alternate procedure to latissimus dorsi tendon transfer in patients with high grade teres minor fatty infiltration S150 Category: Shoulder Rotator Cuff Effect of Polydeoxyribonucleotide on Tendon Healing and Fatty Degeneration in Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair: A Randomized Controlled Trial",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/78cd3453dc789708d18d23cc5bd3dbe8a3d87c76,78cd3453dc789708d18d23cc5bd3dbe8a3d87c76,"[{'authorId': '5911556', 'name': 'E.

Analysis of the Prosperity Performances of G7 Countries: An Application of the LOPCOW-based CRADIS Method,"The prosperity policies and strategies of major economies have the potential to significantly influence both the global economy and the prosperity of other nations. Therefore, the assessment of the prosperity performance of major economies holds paramount importance. In this context, the primary aim of this research is to evaluate the prosperity performance of G7 countries using the LOPCOW-based CRADIS method, leveraging sub-component values from the Legatum Prosperity Index. The secondary objective is to examine the relationship between a country's prosperity performance assessed through the LOPCOW-based CRADIS method and its quantifiability within the Legatum Prosperity Index (LPI) framework, as well as its associations with other Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methodologies. The findings reveal the ranking of countries' prosperity performance as follows: Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, the United States, France, and Italy. Additionally, an assessment of the average prosperity performance of these countries highlights that the United States, France, and Italy perform below the established average. Consequently, it is imperative for these nations to enhance their prosperity performance to make a more substantial contribution to the global economy. Furthermore, sensitivity and discrimination analysis suggest that countries' prosperity performance can be quantified within the LPI framework. Another noteworthy observation is the strong resemblance of the LOPCOW-based CRADIS method to the MEREC-based CRADIS and the LOPCOW-based MARCOS methods",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fcc0f56162f027a40e096425219483042dd6446b,fcc0f56162f027a40e096425219483042dd6446b,"[{'authorId': '1471020955', 'name': 'F.

83 Eating and Nutritional Quality of Meats from Water Buffalo Versus Cattle. a Review,"
 Worldwide, water buffalo [Bubalis bubalis (Buffalo)] is commonly raised as a dual-purpose animal (intentionally for dairy production because their meat quality has been generally perceived as poor). Breeding for milk production, hunting, exhibition, or novelty ownership has been the primary use of Buffalo in United States and Canada. A scientific review was conducted to examine the effect of species (Buffalo vs. cattle) on meat sensory and nutritional quality. Compilation of this type of comparative studies is a necessary exercise to inform all segments of the meat value chain, particularly, final consumers. According to a bibliometric analysis it can be estimated that in the last twenty years the Web of Science database has recorded over 500 publications about Buffalo breeding. Unfortunately, the vast majority of studies comparing quality- or chemical-related trails between these bovid species did not plan adequately in the experimental design to raise or fatten them under the same environmental conditions and (or) made comparisons at a given (fair) endpoint [e.g.., same average age or body weight). Furthermore, most literature reviews on the topic made inferences by making use of observational studies and (or) tabulated findings of different researchers that did not include both species in the same experiment or did not use exclusion criteria to minimize the bias of the interspecific alleged contrasts. This presentation will discuss results from selected controlled experiments reporting quality and nutrient composition of meats from cattle vs. Buffalo. Very few controlled studies could be retrieved on comparison of meat quality (n = 13) and nutrient composition (n = 8) between Buffalo versus indicine (Bos indicus) or European (Bos taurus) cattle. Results from four out of thirteen comparative studies reporting sensory and (or) textural quality traits favored beef; however, three of these experiments only considered textural variables; one of them only included 16 animals older than 50 months of age whereas in the second companion study one half of the experimental group (n = 8) consisted on animals aged 48 to 54 months. According to the survey on proximal/nutrient composition there are minor differences between meats from both species. The results presented herein reveal the potential of young buffaloes to produce comparable or higher-quality meat than cattle counterparts, even under free-range conditions.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3894350e92da391627f8af9f2bc8ea8731355e6b,3894350e92da391627f8af9f2bc8ea8731355e6b,"[{'authorId': '2266313583', 'name': 'Nelson O Huerta-Leidenz'}]"
Feather isotopes ( δ 2 H f ) and morphometrics reveal population-specific migration patterns of the Blackpoll Warbler ( Setophaga striata ),". Blackpoll Warblers ( Setophaga striata ) have declined precipitously according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey, but that survey’s coverage of the boreal breeding range is limited. Migration monitoring offers an attractive tool for additional assessment because migrants from inaccessible portions of the breeding range are included in counts. However, for site-specific trends to be combined into regional or range-wide population trends, the breeding ground origin of the migrants counted at each site must be known. Blackpolls have a loop migration pattern in which spring and fall migrants follow different paths, but very little is known about population-specific routes within North America. We used stable hydrogen isotope assays of tail feathers ( δ 2 H f , 4th rectrix) and wing-length measurements from migration monitoring sites across Canada and the northeastern United States to broadly delineate breeding/natal origins of blackpolls captured at those sites. Blackpolls captured on spring migration in southern Ontario and western Quebec had characteristics expected of birds from breeding range west of the Great Lakes. These birds travel northward from the eastern Gulf of Mexico to Canada east of the Great Lakes before turning westward to reach their final destination between northwestern Ontario and eastern portions of the Northwest Territories. Many birds sampled at Great Lakes sites prior to 2010, but not thereafter, had δ 2 H f and wing-length characteristics expected of breeding range in eastern Canada, suggesting differential rates of population change among regions. Estimates of migratory connectivity indicated considerable mixing of populations from different portions of the breeding range during migration. Our results both corroborate and refine the known clockwise loop migration pattern, provide new insight into spring migration routes across North America",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa6dc6e59ccaa4792dbf1a4f01cabb4420ab0bd6,fa6dc6e59ccaa4792dbf1a4f01cabb4420ab0bd6,"[{'authorId': '2269329318', 'name': 'Erica Dunn'}, {'authorId': '6868882', 'name': 'K.

Patient Preferences for Adjuvant Treatment in Muscle-Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma: A Multi-Country Discrete Choice Experiment,"Purpose The evolving treatment landscape in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma creates challenges for clinicians and patients in selecting the most appropriate therapy. Here, we aimed to understand adjuvant treatment preferences among patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma who underwent radical resection, including tradeoffs between efficacy outcomes and toxicity risks. Patients and Methods An observational, cross-sectional study utilizing a discrete choice experiment was conducted across the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Germany via a web-based survey. Patients ≥18 years of age who self-reported as having been diagnosed with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma were included. Patients indicated their preferences between hypothetical treatment profiles varying in eight attributes relating to efficacy, regimen, and side effects. Preference weights were estimated using hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression; relative attribute importance estimates were calculated. Results Overall, 207 patients were included (age ≥56 years, 65.7%; male, 54.1%). Patients chose adjuvant treatment 91.2% of the time vs no treatment. Prolonging overall survival from 25 to 78 months was most important, followed by reducing serious side effect risks. Increasing disease-free survival from 12 to 24 months was more important than decreasing risks of fatigue from 54% to 15% and nausea from 53% to 7%. Treatment with the shortest dosing regimen was more important for patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy; prolonging overall survival was more important than reducing the risk of a serious side effect in non-US patients; the opposite was found in the United States. Conclusion Patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma who underwent radical resection preferred adjuvant treatment over no treatment regardless of side effects. Patients prioritized overall survival improvements followed by a reduced side effect profile.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c20568f0ebc4cf48a77e76ca31a6c4deae4469bc,c20568f0ebc4cf48a77e76ca31a6c4deae4469bc,"[{'authorId': '1401037202', 'name': 'K.

"A review of horses sent to slaughter for human consumption: impact of horsemeat consumption, residual banned drugs, and public health risks.","Nearly all of the American horses exported to Mexico and Canada are slaughtered for human consumption, and their meat is either exported around the world or consumed locally. Previous work showed that 18 Thoroughbred racehorses purchased by rescues that would have otherwise been sold for export for the sole purpose of slaughter to produce meat for human consumption were administered phenylbutazone. We report the number of American horses exported to Canada and Mexico from 2016 to 2021, the presence of contaminated horsemeat from Canadian slaughterhouses, and the human use and idiosyncratic effects of veterinary phenylbutazone and side effects of clenbuterol, 2 of the drugs that were found in contaminated Canadian horsemeat. The number of live American horses exported to Canada declined precipitously from 2016 to 2017, and a second decline occurred in 2020. All food-producing animals are under strict regulatory control to prevent animals administered banned drugs to enter the food chain. A major principle of this program is zero tolerance for banned drugs and testing for compliance. No regulatory process is in place to remove horses administered banned drugs such as phenylbutazone. The efficacy lasts for more than 24 hours as a result of the irreversible binding to cyclooxygenase, slow elimination, and long elimination half-life of its metabolite oxyphenbutazone. High or frequent doses of phenylbutazone result in disproportionately increased plasma concentrations, which result in the residual presence in tissues. It is this fact that underlies the ban of this drug in food-producing animals. No human clinical surveillance program is in place to monitor individuals on the possible short- and long-term consequences of banned drugs in contaminated horsemeat. If the United States is unable to put in place a regulatory program to remove horses administered banned drugs as exists for all food-producing animals, the exportation of American horses across both borders for the sole purpose of slaughter for human consumption must end.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0b1577505831edf953b1a1073a86a6413683ef3,f0b1577505831edf953b1a1073a86a6413683ef3,"[{'authorId': '144683926', 'name': 'K.

Inequity in authorship of North American lichens,"Abstract. Women have long been underrepresented in the sciences, and their contributions are often overlooked. Previous work has demonstrated a significant productivity gap between men and women when investigating vascular plant authorities and the naming of plant taxa. No study has directly investigated gender inequity, as depicted through authority identity, in the field of lichenology. Our research goal was to describe patterns in gender identity and country of origin for authors of North American lichens. We compiled and analyzed information from the North American Lichen Checklist (including U.S.A. and Canada but not Mexico), independent research, and a gender API to identify the full name, suspected gender, birth year, and country of origin of 889 authors (i.e., people listed as authorities of North American lichen taxa). Of the total 4,895 unique lichen taxa in North America, only 3.2% species were named by a woman. Even standardized by co-authors, men authors contributed significantly more than women authors in this field. We also noted that most authors originated from Europe or the United States. This work suggests that the field of lichenology could provide more support systems for American or Canadian women to contribute naming of new taxa or combinations. While our work focused only on authoring new species as a contribution, we recognize that women may be contributing in other notable ways to lichenology in North America.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8765dc9cbbac6ebb5283b47e3dfd87e441abc933,8765dc9cbbac6ebb5283b47e3dfd87e441abc933,"[{'authorId': '145255386', 'name': 'E.

"THE PRECIOUS STUDY: A PROSPECTIVE, OBSERVATIONAL STUDY OF CD8+ BIOMARKER BASED PROGNOSTIC TEST IN NORTH AMERICAN IBD PATIENTS","
 
 
 The clinical course of IBD varies considerably among patients1. One barrier to personalized medicine in IBD is the lack of a reliable prognostic assay that can be used at diagnosis to guide effective therapy for each patient, to optimize clinical outcomes and minimize complications. To address this need, a whole-blood qPCR-based prognostic assay was developed to divide IBD patients into two subgroups2. This transcriptional signature yields CD8 T-cell exhaustion level data that correlated with disease outcomes among IBD patients in UK2. Here, we aimed to determine if this prognostic assay could stratify an ethnically diverse North American cohort of IBD patients at diagnosis into low and high-risk subgroups.
 
 
 
 PRECIOUS (Predicting Crohn’s & Colitis Outcomes in the United States) is a multi-centre, observational, double-blinded study of patients with active IBD, who are not receiving systemic steroids, immunomodulator, advanced small molecules or biologics. The study is recruiting up to 200 patients between 16-80 years of age, from 14 centres across the US and Canada. Patients are prospectively followed for >12 months after enrolment to monitor disease course, including the requirement for IBD-related surgery or treatment escalations. Patients and clinicians are blinded to the biomarker results and patients are treated according to local practice.
 
 
 
 Of 120 patients recruited to date, 86 have reached the 12-month follow-up timepoint (Table 1). Of the 102 patients with complete race and ethnicity data (Table 1), 63.5% are non-Hispanic Whites, 13.7% identified as Hispanic/Latino, 11.8% Asian and 9.8% Black/African American. Biomarker results were obtained for 80 (88.8%) of the 90 samples tested to date – 10 (11.1%) of samples failed quality control. Of these 80 results, 38 patients (47.5%) were identified as high risk for disease progression and 42 (52.5%) as low risk – a similar breakdown to that seen in the UK cohort2.
 
 
 
 
 This is the first trial of a prognostic biomarker for patients with CD and UC in North America. This patient population was significantly more diverse than the UK cohort which had ~98% White. This diversity is not generally reflected in clinical trials performed in the United States in which approximately 90% of participants for all conditions are White whereas non-Hispanic Whites represent approximately 60% of the U.S. population. 4,5. Our enrolment of only 63.5% non-Hispanic White subjects speaks to our targeted efforts to recruit a representative level of diversity into our study population to that represents the diversity of patients with IBD that are being diagnosed globally6.

Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation,"Cardiac arrest results in extensive morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the development of resuscitation techniques to improve survival with good neurological outcome has been an area of interest for centuries. Survival rates vary widely among different emergency medical service systems, socioeconomic regions, and geographic locations. In the United States in 2020, survival to discharge after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) was 9%, with good neurological outcomes in only 7% of patients. Patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) fared better, with survival-to-discharge rates of 15% to 26% for those with shockable rhythms [ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT)] versus 6% to 16% for those with nonshockable rhythms (asystole or pulseless electrical activity), and a higher likelihood of good neurological outcome (6% to 22% and 3.7% to 9.9%, respectively). Improvements over time in survival after cardiac arrest have been small. Survival to discharge after IHCA has only increased from 16% to 25% from 2005 to 2015 with no improvement since, while survival to discharge after OHCA has remained under 10% for the last 30 years. Efforts to improve the chain of survival after cardiac arrest in recent decades have included widespread education on high-quality bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), early defibrillation with automatic external defibrillators, postarrest targeted temperature management, optimal use of vasopressors and inotropes, and early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). An advanced resuscitation technique that has garnered recent interest for its potential to improve neurologically intact survival from cardiac arrest is extracorporeal CPR (ECPR). ECPR is the use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VAECMO) during or immediately after a cardiac arrest. Because ECPR restores both oxygenation and cardiac output, it supersedes the need for the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) via traditional advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) and allows for early reestablishment of blood pressure and oxygen delivery to reduce end-organ damage. ECPR is not a new technology. The first case series of 39 patients who underwent femoral cannulation for ECPR during cardiac arrest was published in 1976 and boasted 15 long-term survivors. A 2006 systematic review of adult and pediatric VAECMO cited an overall 42.3% survival. Since the initial application of ECMO in cardiac arrest, both the technology and definitions surrounding ECPR have evolved. Currently, ECPR is defined as the use of ECMO “in patients who remain in cardiac arrest despite conventional CPR (CCPR), or when intermittent ROSC occurs, but repetitive cardiac arrest occurs.” ECPR is currently reserved for cardiac arrest suspected to be due to a reversible or treatable etiology. Common indications include acute myocardial infarction, refractory lethal arrhythmia, and massive pulmonary embolus (PE). In each instance, ECPR serves to provide circulatory support and cerebral perfusion until the underlying condition resolves or can be addressed. Though uncommon and supported only by observational studies, cardiac arrest from accidental hypothermiamay be particularly amenable to ECPR as hypothermia is easily corrected by the ECMO circuit alone and likely mitigates neurologic injury. Since the advent of ECPR, the ability to rapidly deploy ECPR teams and equipment has been considered critical to attaining neurologically favorable survival. ECPR teams must strive to minimize “no-flow time” (the time from arrest to initiation of CPR) and “low-flow time” (the time from initiation of CCPR to initiation of ECMO). Factors influencing ECPR outcomes and commonly adopted as ECPR selection criteria include age, initial rhythm, laboratory values, receipt of bystander CPR, time from arrest to ECMO initiation, end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) level, and absence of chronic end-stage comorbid conditions or advanced malignancy.

2744. A 5-Year Single-Center Review of Strongyloides Seropositivity in Kidney Transplant Candidates in Rural Central Texas,"Abstract Background The American Society of Transplantation recommends screening for Strongyloides stercoralis for people from or with extended travel to endemic areas including tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Appalachian region of the United States. Asymptomatic carriers without risk factors can potentially be missed during screening assessments. Consequently, they can develop deadly hyperinfection and disseminated disease with immunosuppressive therapy. The aim of this study is to identify demographics and characteristics among our population of Strongyloides-infected kidney transplant candidates in rural Central Texas. Methods This study is a single-center, retrospective chart review of patients aged 18 or older who underwent evaluation for kidney transplant at our institution in rural Central Texas between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2022 and tested equivocal or positive for serum Strongyloides IgG antibody. Results Out of the 1653 patients who underwent Strongyloides screening during their evaluation for kidney transplant within the study period, 182 (11.0%) returned as either equivocal or positive. Demographics of this Strongyloides-infected population are noted in table 1. 86.3% of these patients were born in the United States or Canada, 6.6% from Mexico, and 3.3% from Asia. 33.0% reported no international travel outside the United States (table 1). Comorbidities and symptoms of our population are listed in table 2. 83.5% were asymptomatic. Laboratory data and other risk factors for Strongyloides infection are noted in table 3. Only 6.0% had eosinophilia at time of diagnosis (considered as greater than 0.00 - 0.76 10*9/L). None of our population tested positive for human T-lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-1). Out of the 69 patients who were asked, 71.0% reported a history of walking outside barefoot. Demographic information and international travel outside the United States Patient comorbidities and symptoms Laboratory data and other risk factors Conclusion Importantly, 11.0% of our population were found to have an equivocal or positive Strongyloides serology. Of those, 33.0% had no apparent risk factors for Strongyloides infection including international travel, suggesting local acquisition of the infection in rural Central Texas. More research is needed to identify unique risk factors for this population including environmental studies of this underserved population.

Real world sequence of peptide receptor radionucleotide therapy (PRRT) and chemotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs).,"e16237 Background: Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) is an effective therapy for advanced pNETs but carries long-term risks of myeloid neoplasia. Early data from United States centres may suggest a higher risk of myelodysplasia and leukemia in patients treated with temozolomide prior to PRRT. The objective of this study is to characterize the sequence of PRRT and chemotherapy at two Canadian pNET treatment centres, distinguished by the availability of PRRT. Methods: This is a multicentre retrospective cohort study involving The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre (TOHCC; PRRT non-treatment centre (PRRT-NTC)) and London Regional Cancer Centre (LRCC; PRRT treatment centre (PRRT-TC). Patients with histologically confirmed pNETs between January 2010 – June 2021 over the age 18 (n=226), with metastatic disease (n=177) were included. Demographic, clinical and cancer treatments were collected. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the sequence of systemic therapy. Results: 177 patients with metastatic pNET were identified. Systemic therapies included octreotide (n=59, 40%), lanreotide (n=47, 32%), targeted agents (n=40, 27%), chemotherapy (n=48, 33%) and PRRT (n=47, 32%). Of patients receiving chemotherapy, 22 (46%) received temozolomide-containing regimens. The most frequent first line therapies were somatostatin analogues (SSAs, n=76, 43%), chemotherapy (n=23, 13%) and observation (n=18, 10%), second-line were PRRT (n=24, 14%), targeted therapy (n=26, 15%) and SSA (n=13, 7%), and third-line were PRRT (n=15, 9%), chemotherapy (n=11, 6%) and targeted therapy (n=8, 5%). There were 83 (47%) patients treated at the PRRT-TC, of which 33 (40%) received PRRT prior to chemotherapy and 7 (8%) received temozolomide-containing therapy prior to PRRT. In comparison, 94 (53%) patients were treated at the PRRT-NTC, of which 1 (1%) received PRRT prior to chemotherapy and 0 (0%) received PRRT prior to temozolomide-containing therapy. Conclusions: In this large cohort of metastatic pNET patients, the sequence of chemotherapy and PRRT showed centre-to-centre variability with patients treated at a PRRT-TC being more likely to receive chemotherapy, including temozolomide, prior to PRRT. This may be explained in-part by referral/practice patterns, and PRRT availability. These findings suggest an opportunity to evaluate and optimize the sequence of systemic therapy with the increasing availability of PRRT.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cfbb2a34022500e8907f0f8e6fe54c8259d2f6d3,cfbb2a34022500e8907f0f8e6fe54c8259d2f6d3,"[{'authorId': '2053634773', 'name': 'W.

Harbor Porpoise Aggregations in the Salish Sea,"Harbor porpoises are typically seen in small groups of 1–3 individuals, with aggregations of 20+ individuals treated as rare events. Since the 1990s, the harbor porpoise population in the Salish Sea has seen a significant recovery, and an increased number of observed aggregations that exceed the more usual small group sizes has been observed in recent years. By combining the observational data of United States and Canadian research organizations, community scientists, and whale watch captains or naturalists, we demonstrate that harbor porpoise aggregations appear to be more common than previously known, with 160 aggregations documented in 2022 alone. Behavioral data also indicate that foraging behaviors are common and social behaviors, like mating, are seen more often during these encounters compared to small groups. Other behaviors that are considered to be rare or unknown were also observed during these encounters, including cooperative foraging and vessel approach. These aggregations are likely important foraging and social gatherings for harbor porpoises. This holistic approach integrating data from two countries and multiple sources provides a population level assessment that more effectively reflects the behavior of harbor porpoises in this region, which do not recognize the socio-political boundaries imposed upon the natural world.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/949b8638e3ed4e52ab790cbe6a99b1129975713c,949b8638e3ed4e52ab790cbe6a99b1129975713c,"[{'authorId': '46455172', 'name': 'David Anderson'}, {'authorId': '2175418443', 'name': 'Laurie Shuster'}, {'authorId': '50858287', 'name': 'C.

Abstract. Over decades physical education has implemented different pedagogical approaches or models as tools to improve the educational practice and the implementation of a comprehensive teaching method as the Teaching Games for Understanding has been one of those forms. However, there is a current debate with respect what would be the best approach to be implemented in the physical education classes and Mexico has not been the exception. The purpose of this systematic review from the last 5 years is to analyze an approach as pedagogical tool that physical education teachers from different levels in Mexico could implement. Through the PRISMA methodology there were 562 articles identifies, once the inclusion criteria were applied, only 25 articles were eligible, although only 12 completed the inclusion criteria. The results show that implementing the Teaching Games for Understanding is an effective and efficient to be used by teachers within the physical education classes. Its implementation has been predominantly in developed countries such as Spain, Canada and the United States. The combination with another method has also shown to be an attractive way so that children and youth participate in class. As such, it can be said that this pedagogical tool could be an incentive to implemented with success by physical education teachers in Mexico. Being an area of opportunity to an in-depth and epistemological study in the use of this approach in physical education classes in Mexico.

Impact of #PsychTwitter in promoting global psychiatry: A hashtag analysis study,"Introduction Multiple studies have shown how valuable Twitter hashtags can be for promoting content related to different themes in the online community. This arena has grown into a rich data source for public health observation and understanding key trends in healthcare on a global scale. In the field of mental health in particular, it would be of benefit to understand and report the key stakeholders' (individual mental health professionals, academic organizations and their countries) trends and patterns of psychiatric knowledge and information dissemination using #PsychTwitter. Objective In this study, we aim to evaluate the achieved outreach of psychiatry-related tweets using the hashtag #PsychTwitter. Methods We utilized the Symplur Signals research analytics tool to characterize tweets containing #PsychTwitter from the 20th of August, 2019, to the 20th of August, 2022. Results The #PsychTwitter movement resulted in 125,297 tweets that were shared by 40,058 Twitter users and generated a total of 492,565,230 impressions (views). The three largest identified groups of contributors were Doctors (13.8% of all tweets), Org. Advocacy (6.2% of all tweets), and Researcher/Academic (4% of all tweets) stakeholders. The top influential accounts consisted of 55 psychiatrists and 16 institutional or organizational accounts. The top 5 countries from where most of the tweets containing #PsychTwitter were shared include the United States (54.3% of all users), the United Kingdom (10.4% of all users), Canada (4.9% of all users), India (2% of all users), and Australia (1.8% of all users). Conclusion This is the first of its kind study featuring the influence and usage of #PsychTwitter and covering its global impact in the field of psychiatry using the Twitter platform. Our results indicate that Twitter represents a broadly used platform for mental health-related discussions.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0adc8b394145b7543eafd879b562844c204b4edf,0adc8b394145b7543eafd879b562844c204b4edf,"[{'authorId': '2079616849', 'name': 'F.

"North American Dinophysis, late‐comers to the harmful algae world","Species of Dinophysis produce diarrhetic toxins and pectenotoxins and frequently cause harvesting bans in intensive shellfish cultivation sites in Western Europe, Chile, Perú, and Japan (Reguera et al., 2014). These dinoflagellates have attracted attention during the last 30 years due to their socioeconomic impacts and the long trail of difficulties faced before identification of their nutritional sources and establishment of laboratory cultures (Park et al., 2006; Reguera et al., 2012). For decades, it was a common belief that Dinophysis posed no threat to public health or shellfish exploitation in the USA (Horner et al., 1997; Wolny et al., 2020). The first official report of a diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) event in 2008 was triggered by serendipitous detection of a bloom of Dinophysis ovum in Texas Bay (Gulf of Mexico) where an in situ imaging flowcytobot had been deployed for early warning of Karenia brevis (Campbell et al., 2010). Unsafe levels of okadaic acid (OA) led to the first harvesting bans on Galveston Bay oysters (Deeds et al., 2010). On the Northwest (Pacific) coast, three persons were intoxicated by the end of July 2011 after consuming mussels from Sequim Bay State Park (recreational picking), and this event prompted the first DSP closures in the Olympic Peninsula and Strait of Juan de Fuca (Trainer et al., 2013). Eighty nautical miles further north, more than 60 people became sick after eating mussels in restaurants on Salt Spring Island, Canada, that had been collected the same last week of July (Taylor et al., 2013). Guided by the magnitude of the (luckily nonfatal) human bioassays, we suggest that the Sequim Bay State Park event was probably at the southern limit of a mesoscale event of the same Dinophysis populations contaminating shellfish in the whole Salish Sea area. In the Northeast USA, the mild toxicity of the first Dinophysis acuminata strain established in culture (Hackett et al., 2009) and field observations questioning the toxic nature of Canadian D. norvegica (Lawrence et al., 2000) both contributed to the perception of Dinophysis blooms as irrelevant events. In 2015, a dense and persistent population of D. acuminata led to the first DSPrelated harvesting bans in coastal embayments of the southern Gulf of Maine (ICES, 2016). Dinophysis are patchily distributed low biomass harmful algal blooms (HABs) that are, most of the year, below detection levels. It is possible that no Dinophysisrelated issues occurred in the USA before the Texas event in 2008. But caution is necessary since systematic monitoring of DSP in most United States waters is lacking, and toxin analyses are prompted in most places only when high numbers of Dinophysis are observed. The sequence of “exceptional” DSP events may be anomalous. Since there are no longterm records, these isolated events are simply oddities and cannot be linked to environmental change (GlobalHAB, 2021).",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d4c6503b7d4d8dec41faf7cc6365edc1ee53761,2d4c6503b7d4d8dec41faf7cc6365edc1ee53761,"[{'authorId': '1891309', 'name': 'Patricio A.

Propuestas de manejo de Propiedad Intelectual para los retos del sector vitivinícola en sostenibilidad y para enfrentar el cambio climático,"This research studies the functioning of three categories of intellectual property that have the potential of helping out the vitivinicultural sector to face the sustainability and climate change challenges without losing their distinctiveness and reputation in the market. Specifically, we review the geographical indications, denominations of origin and certificate trademarks. These intellectual categories refer to the prestige of products, in regard to their origin. But their scope and functioning are different. We study the advantages and obstacles that the denominations of origin face in Mexico in other productive sectors. We contrast these elements with those of geographical indication and certification trademarks, to assess which of these categories involve a more appropriate operation to distinguish wine products that comply with the OIV sustainability principles. Our contribution portrays two proposals based on the national and international legal context of Mexico. For instance, the more recent Treaty between Mexico, United States and Canada, for the first time in the region, recognizes certification trademarks (article 20.18) and indications of origin (article 20.29). It should be noted that, even though the geographical indication is a category that already exists among the wine sector in other OIV member countries, GIs and certification trademarks were recently recognized within the national legislation in Mexico in 2018. Hence, these categories of intellectual property are not yet in use in the national wine sector that is on the rise in the country. Therefore, it is relevant to evaluate which of them may contribute facing the mentioned challenges; the proposals of this research are: Firstly, the possibility of establishing a certification trademark for those products that comply with the principles of sustainability is analyzed. For this purpose, it is important that the rules of operation of the certification trademark have flexible conditions that can be easily updated to the social and climatic context that may occur in each harvest. The second proposal reviews the possibility of establishing a cross-border geographical indication, to distinguish wine products from California in USA and Baja California, Mexico. If the conditions of the legal framework are feasible for such GI, the producers in this territory may collaborate to deal with their different needs, having a distinctive sign in common, with which the consumer can identify this production area. Each of the proposals generate different alternatives that intent to give the necessary flexibilities the vitivinicultur sector need to accommodate the climate change conditions of each harvest, but preserving the umbrella distinctiveness for small-scale producers in the market. This research will develop its hypothesis through the study of the intellectual property international framework that applies for Mexico, together with the literature that has been developed regarding the indications of origin in the vitivinicultural sector.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b1cfd86874b24fe1469ded939d9198c200ea71cf,b1cfd86874b24fe1469ded939d9198c200ea71cf,"[{'authorId': '115736013', 'name': 'Ana Georgina Alba Betancourt'}, {'authorId': '107942338', 'name': 'L.

Consequences of Multigenerational Services Adoption Behavior: Global Client Engagement,"This study uses adoption and usage data on the client and firm–client interactions across four technology generations of new-age products/services from 13 developed and emerging markets over an eight-year period to describe how multigenerational service (MGS) adoption behavior influences direct (purchases) and indirect (references and feedback) global client engagement and whether this relationship is moderated by product/service failures and cultural factors. The authors propose metrics to measure the number of generations adopted (MGD), the number of products and features within a generation (MGFs), and the adoption time between generations (MGT). They find that client usage revenue (CUR) is enhanced by greater MGD and higher MGFs combined with lower MGT. However, CUR varies by differences in the needs of clients' own customers, failures, and culture. Greater direct engagement affects reference and feedback behavior, moderated by cultural differences in individualism, power distance, and masculinity. For a typical client in the United States and Canada, a one-unit improvement in MGD and MGFs and a one-year improvement in MGT enhance CUR by $8,150, $5,200, and $2,310 per client, respectively, versus a corresponding enhancement of $4,820, $3,640, and $1,620, respectively, per client in Colombia and Mexico. These findings provide several implications for executives who manage multigenerational innovations across countries regarding client engagement, launching MGS, market entry, and failure recovery.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/59fae0993b8886a5db931970cbd57691352cad93,59fae0993b8886a5db931970cbd57691352cad93,"[{'authorId': '28849188', 'name': 'A.

(2) What are the potential struggles and adaptations required to integrate Decolonial, Intersectional Pedagogies within Canadian NursMed Education in service of redressing intersecting health and social inequities? Briefly, Decolonial, Intersectional Pedagogies are philosophies of learning that encourage teachers and students to reflect on health through the lenses of settler-colonialism, health equity, and social justice. Drawing on critical ethnographic research methods, we conducted in-depth interviews with 25 faculty members and engaged in participant observation of classrooms in university-based Canadian NursMed Education. The research findings are organized into three major themes, beginning with common institutional features influencing pedagogical approaches. The next set of findings addresses the complex strategies participants apply to integrate Decolonial, Intersectional Pedagogies. Lastly, the findings illustrate the emotional and spiritual toll some faculty members face when attempting to deliver Decolonial, Intersectional Pedagogies. We conclude that through the application of Decolonial, Intersectional Pedagogies teachers and students can support movements towards health equity, social justice, and unlearning/undoing settler-colonialism. This study contributes new knowledge to stimulate dialog and action regarding the role of health professions education, specifically Nursing and Medicine as an upstream determinant of health in settler-colonial nations such as Canada, United States, Australia, and New Zealand.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/558a04ea9ccc3cd85ed3560789b6220804df3c39,558a04ea9ccc3cd85ed3560789b6220804df3c39,"[{'authorId': '120029218', 'name': 'T.

The Blue Beret,"When we think of United Nations (UN) peacekeepers, the first image that is conjured in our mind is of an individual sporting a blue helmet or a blue beret (fig. 1). While simple and uncomplicated, these blue accessories represent an expression and an embodiment resembling that of a warrior, sent to bring peace to conflict-torn communities. UN peacekeeping first conceptually emerged in 1948 in the wake of the Arab-Israeli war that ensued following the United Kingdom’s relinquishing of its mandate over Palestine, and the proclamation of the State of Israel. “Forged in the crucible of practical diplomacy” (Rubinstein 16), unarmed military observers were deployed to Palestine to monitor the hostilities and mediate armistice agreements between Israel and its Arab neighbours. This operation, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), significantly exemplified the diplomatic and observational capabilities of military men, in line with the UN Charter’s objectives of international peace and security, setting henceforth a basic archetype for international peacekeeping. It was only in 1956, however, that peacekeeping formally emerged when armed UN forces deployed to Egypt to supervise the withdrawal of forces occupying the Suez Canal (informally known as the ‘Second Arab-Israeli’ war). Here, the formation of UN peacekeeping represented an international pacifying mechanism comprised of multiple third-party intermediaries whereby peaceful resolution would be achieved by transcending realist instincts of violence for political attainment in favour of applying a less-destructive liberal model of persuasion, compromise, and perseverance (Howard). ‘Blue helmet’ peacekeeping operations continue to be regarded by the UN as an integral subsidiary instrument of its organisation. At present, there are 12 active peacekeeping operations led by the UN Department of Peacekeeping across the world (United Nations Peacekeeping).

Fig. 1: United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) sporting blue berets (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-troops-awarded-un-medals-for-south-sudan-peacekeeping-mission)
But where did the blue helmets and berets originate from? Rubinstein details a surprisingly mundane account of the origins of the political accessory that is now a widely recognised symbol for UN peacekeepers’ uniforms. Peacekeepers’ uniforms initially emerged from the ad hoc need to distinguish UN troops from those of the armed forces in a distinctive dress during the 1947 UNTSO mission by any means and material readily available, such as armbands and helmets (Henry). The era of early peacekeeping operations also saw ‘observers’ carry UN flags and paint their vehicle white with ‘UN’ written in large black letters in order to distinguish themselves. The blue helmets specifically came to be adorned during the first peacekeeping operation in 1956 during the Suez crisis. At this time, Canada supplied a large number of non-combatant troops whose uniform was the same as the belligerent British forces, party to the conflict. An effort to thus distinguish the peacekeepers was made by spray-painting surplus World War II American plastic helmet-liners, which were available in quantity in Europe, blue (Urquhart; Rubenstein).
The two official colours of the UN are ‘light blue’ and ‘white’. The unique light “UN” blue colour, in particular, was approved as the background for the UN flag in the 1947 General Assembly Resolution 167(II), alongside a white emblem depicting a map of the world surrounded by two olive branches. While the UN’s use of the colour was chosen as a “practical effect of identifying the Organization in areas of trouble and conflict, to any and all parties concerned”, the colour blue was also specifically chosen at this time as “an integral part of the visual identity of the organisation” representing “peace in opposition to red, for war” (United Nations). Blue is seen to be placed in antithesis to the colour red across several fields including popular culture, and even within politics, as a way to typically indicate conflict between two warring groups. Within popular culture, for example, many films in the science fiction, fantasy, or horror genres, use a clearly demarcated, dichotomous ‘red vs. blue’ colour scheme in their posters (fig. 2). This is also commonly seen in political campaign posters, for example during the 2021 US presidential election (fig. 3).

Fig. 2: Blue and red colour schemes in film posters (left to right: Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), Captain Marvel (2019), and The Dead Don’t Die (2019))

This dichotomy can be traced back to the high Middle Ages between the fourteenth and seventeenth century where the colour blue became a colour associated with “moral implications”, rivalling both the colours black and red which were extremely popular in clothing during the eras of the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance (Pastoureau 85). This ‘moral metamorphosis’ in European society was largely influenced by the views of Christian Protestant reformers concerning the social, religious, and artistic use of the colour blue (Pastoureau). A shift in the use of blue and its symbolic connotations may also be seen, for example, in early Christian art and iconography, specifically those deriving from depictions of the Virgin Mary; according to Pastoureau (50), this provides the “clearest illustration of the social, religious, and artistic consequences of blue's new status”.
Up until the eighteenth century, the colour blue, specifically ‘sky blue’ or light blue tones resemblant of the “UN” shade of blue, had minimal symbolic or aesthetic value, particularly in European culture and certainly amongst nobility and the upper levels of society. Historically, light blue was typically associated with peasants’ clothing. This was due to the fact that peasants would often dye their clothes using the pigment of the woad herb; however, the woad would poorly penetrate cloth fibres and inevitably fade under the effects of sunlight and soap, thereby resulting in a ‘bland’ colour (Pastoureau). Although the blue hues worn by the nobility and wealthy were typically denser and more solid, a “new fashion” for light blue tones gradually took hold at the courts of the wealthy and the bourgeoisie, inevitably becoming deeply anchored in Western European counties (Pastoureau). Here, the reorganisation of the colour hierarchy and reformulation of blue certainly resembles Pastoureau’s (10) assertion that “any history of colour is, above all, a social history”. Within the humanities, colour represents a social phenomenon and construction. Colour thus provides insights into the ways society assigns meaning to it, “constructs its codes and values, establishes its uses, and determines whether it is acceptable or not” (Pastoureau, 10). In this way, although colour is a naturally occurring phenomenon, it is also a complex cultural construct. That the UN and its subsidiary bodies, including the Department of Peacekeeping, deliberately assigned light blue as its official organisational colour therefore usefully illustrates a significant social process of meaning-making and cultural sociology. The historical transition of light blue’s association from one of poverty in and around the eighteenth century to one of wealth in the nineteenth century may perhaps also be indicative of the next transitional era for light blue in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, representative of the amalgamation or unity between the two classes. Representing the ambitions not only of the organisation, but rather of the 193 member-states, of attaining worldwide peace, light blue may be seen as a colour of peace, as well as one of the people, for the people. This may be traced back, according to Pastoureau, as early as the Middle Ages where the colour blue was seen a colour of ‘peace’.
Colours, however, do not solely determine social and cultural relevance in a given historical event. Rather, fabrics and clothing too offer “the richest and most diverse source of artifacts” in understanding history and culture. Artifacts such as UN peacekeepers’ blue berets and helmets necessarily incorporate economic, social, ideological, aesthetic, and symbolic aspects of both colour and material into the one complete uniform (Pastoureau). While the ‘UN blue’ is associated with peace, the beret, on the other hand, has been described as “an ally in the battlefield” (Kliest). The history of the beret is largely rooted in the armed forces – institutions typically associated with conflict and violence – and it continues to be a vital aspect of military uniforms worn by personnel from countries all around the globe. Given that the large majority of UN peacekeeping forces are made up of military personnel, peacekeeping, as both an action and an institution, thus adds a layer of complexity when discussing artifact symbolism. Here, a peacekeeper’s uniform uniquely represents the embodiment of an amalgamation of two traditionally juxtaposing concepts: peace, nurture, and diplomacy (often associated with ‘feminine’ qualities) versus conflict, strength, and discipline (often associated with ‘masculine’ qualities). A peacekeeper’s uniform thus represents the UN’s institutionalisation of “soldiers for peace” (Howard) who are, as former UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold proclaimed, “the front line of a moral force” (BBC cited in Howard). Aside from its association with the armed forces, the beret has also been used as a fashion symbol by political revolutionaries, such as members of the ‘Black Panther Party’ (BPP) founded in the 1960s during the US Civil Rights Movement, as well as Che Guevara, prominent Leftist figure in the Cuban Revolution (see fig. 4).

A Review: Keystone Environmental Problems are the Labyrinth Root causes that Resonate together with Socioeconomic Factors on Igniting Global Conflicts and Warfare,"
When mitigating a man-made environmental problem, if it results in the permanent disappearance of one or more other environmental problems, then that mitigated problem can be considered a keystone environmental problem. Based on the aforesaid definition, eight environmental problems have been identified, such as population explosion, air pollution, deforestation, water pollution, scarcity and salination, overexploitation of natural resources, urbanisation (including industrialization, urban sprawl and settlements), intensive farming, and the global energy crisis. It has also been found that there is a significant relationship between these keystone environmental problems and global conflicts. For instance, according to the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), over the last six decades, globally, more than 40% of the internal conflicts have been caused by overexploitation of natural resources, which is a known keystone environmental issue. Thus, the importance of identifying the role of keystone environmental problems in igniting global environmental conflicts and warfare has been widely realised. This study was conducted using qualitative content analysis methodology reveals that labyrinth established by root keystone environmental problems resonates together with socio-economic factors conflagrate global environmental conflicts and warfare, such as Cauvery River conflict between Tamil Nadu and Kerala States in South India, conflict from trespassing fishermen poaching in waters of neighbouring country from both India and Sri Lanka, Environmental Conflict in Northeast India and Bangladesh due to flooding (natural disaster) caused by climate change led to migration, West bank water crisis between Israel and Palestine, Russia’s invasion into Ukraine in 2022, Alto Cenepa war, Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) crisis between Ethiopia and Egypt, environmental conflicts in Philippines, conflict for land resources in Ethiopia, environmental conflict in Mexico, environmental conflict in Peru, Northeast India, Pakistan, Israel (Gaza), conflict of Mauritania and Senegal, Israel-Palestine (West bank), Somalia- Ethiopia, El Salvador-Honduras, Conflict between Kenyan tribes, dispute between North and South Sudan, and transboundary air pollution (causing acid rain) issue between the USA and Canada.

Association between migration and severe maternal outcomes in high-income countries: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Literature focusing on migration and maternal health inequalities is inconclusive, possibly because of the heterogeneous definitions and settings studied. We aimed to synthesize the literature comparing the risks of severe maternal outcomes in high-income countries between migrant and native-born women, overall and by host country and region of birth. Methods and findings Systematic literature review and meta-analysis using the Medline/PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for the period from January 1, 1990 to April 18, 2023. We included observational studies comparing the risk of maternal mortality or all-cause or cause-specific severe maternal morbidity in high-income countries between migrant women, defined by birth outside the host country, and native-born women; used the Newcastle–Ottawa scale tool to assess risk of bias; and performed random-effects meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses were planned by host country and region of birth. The initial 2,290 unique references produced 35 studies published as 39 reports covering Europe, Australia, the United States of America, and Canada. In Europe, migrant women had a higher risk of maternal mortality than native-born women (pooled risk ratio [RR], 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14, 1.58; p < 0.001), but not in the USA or Australia. Some subgroups of migrant women, including those born in sub-Saharan Africa (pooled RR, 2.91; 95% CI, 2.03, 4.15; p < 0.001), Latin America and the Caribbean (pooled RR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.43, 5.35; p = 0.002), and Asia (pooled RR, 1.57, 95% CI, 1.09, 2.26; p = 0.01) were at higher risk of maternal mortality than native-born women, but not those born in Europe or in the Middle East and North Africa. Although they were studied less often and with heterogeneous definitions of outcomes, patterns for all-cause severe maternal morbidity and maternal intensive care unit admission were similar. We were unable to take into account other social factors that might interact with migrant status to determine maternal health because many of these data were unavailable. Conclusions In this systematic review of the existing literature applying a single definition of “migrant” women, we found that the differential risk of severe maternal outcomes in migrant versus native-born women in high-income countries varied by host country and region of origin. These data highlight the need to further explore the mechanisms underlying these inequities.

The effects of flipped classrooms to improve learning outcomes in undergraduate health professional education: A systematic review,"Abstract Background The ‘flipped classroom’ approach is an innovative approach in educational delivery systems. In a typical flipped class model, work that is typically done as homework in the didactic model is interactively undertaken in the class with the guidance of the teacher, whereas listening to a lecture or watching course‐related videos is undertaken at home. The essence of a flipped classroom is that the activities carried out during traditional class time and self‐study time are reversed or ‘flipped’. Objectives The primary objectives of this review were to assess the effectiveness of the flipped classroom intervention for undergraduate health professional students on their academic performance, and their course satisfaction. Search Methods We identified relevant studies by searching MEDLINE (Ovid), APA PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) as well as several more electronic databases, registries, search engines, websites, and online directories. The last search update was performed in April 2022. Selection Criteria Included studies had to meet the following criteria: Participants: Undergraduate health professional students, regardless of the type of healthcare streams (e.g., medicine, pharmacy), duration of the learning activity, or the country of study. Intervention: We included any educational intervention that included the flipped classroom as a teaching and learning tool in undergraduate programs, regardless of the type of healthcare streams (e.g., medicine, pharmacy). We also included studies that aimed to improve student learning and/or student satisfaction if they included the flipped classroom for undergraduate students. We excluded studies on standard lectures and subsequent tutorial formats. We also excluded studies on flipped classroom methods, which did not belong to the health professional education(HPE) sector (e.g., engineering, economics). Outcomes: The included studies used primary outcomes such as academic performance as judged by final examination grades/scores or other formal assessment methods at the immediate post‐test, as well as student satisfaction with the method of learning. Study design: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐experimental studies (QES), and two‐group comparison designs. Although we had planned to include cluster‐level RCTs, natural experiments, and regression discontinuity designs, these were not available. We did not include qualitative research. Data Collection and Analysis Two members of the review team independently screened the search results to assess articles for their eligibility for inclusion. The screening involved an initial screening of the title and abstracts, and subsequently, the full text of selected articles. Discrepancies between the two investigators were settled through discussion or consultation with a third author. Two members of the review team then extracted the descriptions and data from the included studies. Main Results We found 5873 potentially relevant records, of which we screened 118 of them in full text, and included 45 studies (11 RCTs, 19 QES, and 15 two‐group observational studies) that met the inclusion criteria. Some studies assessed more than one outcome. We included 44 studies on academic performance and eight studies on students' satisfaction outcomes in the meta‐analysis. The main reasons for excluding studies were that they had not implemented a flipped class approach or the participants were not undergraduate students in health professional education. A total of 8426 undergraduate students were included in 45 studies that were identified for this analysis. The majority of the studies were conducted by students from medical schools (53.3%, 24/45), nursing schools (17.8%, 8/45), pharmacy schools (15.6%, 7/45). medical, nursing, and dentistry schools (2.2%, 1/45), and other health professional education programs (11.1%, 5/45). Among these 45 studies identified, 16 (35.6%) were conducted in the United States, six studies in China, four studies in Taiwan, three in India, two studies each in Australia and Canada, followed by nine single studies from Brazil, German, Iran, Norway, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Based on overall average effect sizes, there was better academic performance in the flipped class method of learning compared to traditional class learning (standardised mean difference [SMD] = 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25 to 0.90, τ 2: 1.16; I 2: 98%; p < 0.00001, 44 studies, n = 7813). In a sensitivity analysis that excluded eleven studies with imputed data from the original analysis of 44 studies, academic performance in the flipped class method of learning was better than traditional class learning (SMD = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.24 to 0.85, τ 2: 0.76; I 2: 97%; p < 0.00001, 33 studies, n = 5924); all being low certainty of evidence. Overall, student satisfaction with flipped class learning was positive compared to traditional class learning (SMD = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.15 to 0.82, τ 2: 0.19, I 2:89%, p < 0.00001, 8 studies n = 1696); all being low certainty of evidence. Authors' Conclusions In this review, we aimed to find evidence of the flipped classroom intervention's effectiveness for undergraduate health professional students. We found only a few RCTs, and the risk of bias in the included non‐randomised studies was high. Overall, implementing flipped classes may improve academic performance, and may support student satisfaction in undergraduate health professional programs. However, the certainty of evidence was low for both academic performance and students' satisfaction with the flipped method of learning compared to the traditional class learning. Future well‐designed sufficiently powered RCTs with low risk of bias that report according to the CONSORT guidelines are needed.",2023,8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dafeac9bff2f9ee82d2e0e3b3f5d310f8514882a,dafeac9bff2f9ee82d2e0e3b3f5d310f8514882a,"[{'authorId': '2081215604', 'name': 'Cho Naing'}, {'authorId': '18515262', 'name': 'M.

The benefits of big-team science for conservation: Lessons learned from trinational monarch butterfly collaborations,"Many pressing conservation issues are complex problems caused by multiple social and environmental drivers; their resolution is aided by interdisciplinary teams of scientists, decision makers, and stakeholders working together. In these situations, how do we generate science to effectively guide conservation (resource management and policy) decisions? This paper describes elements of successful big-team science in conservation, as well as shortcomings and lessons learned, based on our work with the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) in North America. We summarize literature on effective science teams, extracting information about elements of success, effective implementation approaches, and barriers or pitfalls. We then describe recent and ongoing conservation science for the monarch butterfly in North America. We focus primarily on the activities of the Monarch Conservation Science Partnership–an international collaboration of interdisciplinary scientists, policy experts and natural resource managers spanning government, non-governmental and academic institutions—which developed science to inform imperilment status, recovery options, and monitoring strategies. We couch these science efforts in the adaptative management framework of Strategic Habitat Conservation, the business model for conservation employed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to inform decision-making needs identified by stakeholders from Canada, the United States, and Mexico. We conclude with elements critical to effective big-team conservation science, discuss why science teams focused on applied conservation problems are unique relative to science teams focusing on traditional or theoretical research, and list benefits of big team science in conservation.",2023,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/37988d829d372de9ec0e24e907ae3d00727cb86c,37988d829d372de9ec0e24e907ae3d00727cb86c,"[{'authorId': '5212805', 'name': 'J.

Obesity is associated with alterations in antral follicle dynamics in eumenorrheic women.,"STUDY QUESTION
Are ovarian antral follicle dynamics altered in women with obesity and regular ovulatory cycles?


SUMMARY ANSWER
Eumenorrheic women with obesity display evidence of suppressed antral follicle dynamics as judged by fewer recruitment events, selectable follicles, and anovulatory dominant follicles, as well as lower anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentrations and an increased prevalence of luteal phase defects.


WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY
Ovarian antral follicle development is a dynamic process involving distinct follicular and endocrine events that are critical for the occurrence of regular monthly ovulations. Follicle dynamics have not been prospectively evaluated in eumenorrheic women with obesity despite the known impact of obesity on gonadotropin production, ovarian steroid hormone concentrations, and fecundity.


STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION
This was a prospective, longitudinal study of 42 women conducted over one inter-ovulatory interval (IOI).


PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS
A group of 21 women with obesity (total percent body fat ≥35%) and a group of 21 women without obesity (total percent body fat <35%) underwent transvaginal ultrasonography and venipuncture every-other-day for one IOI at an academic clinical research unit. Participants were aged 19-38 years and had a history of self-reported regular menstrual cycles (21-35 days). Follicle number and diameter (≥2 mm) were quantified at each visit. Individual growth profiles for all follicles that grew to ≥7 mm were assessed. Blood samples were assayed for gonadotropins, AMH, estradiol, and progesterone.


MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE
Women with obesity exhibited fewer recruitment events (mean ± SD, 1 ± 1 vs 2 ± 1 events; P = 0.010) and fewer selectable follicles (4 ± 3 vs 8 ± 6 follicles per participant; P = 0.022) during an IOI compared to women without obesity. AMH levels were lower in women with obesity (4.40 ± 3.01 vs 5.94 ± 2.49 ng/ml; P = 0.023), while gonadotropin profiles were similar between groups, across the IOI. Of the individual follicles tracked, fewer follicles progressed to >10 mm in the cohort with obesity (30 vs 40 follicles; P = 0.04) and fewer anovulatory follicles achieved dominance (9 vs 18 follicles; P = 0.041). Ovulatory follicles were selected at smaller diameters in women with compared to those without obesity (7.5 ± 1.6 vs 9.5 ± 1.9 mm; P = 0.001). Luteal phase defects were also more common in women with compared to those without obesity, as defined by either integrated (76 vs 29%, P = 0.002) or maximum (71 vs 24%, P = 0.002) luteal progesterone.


LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION
This study was limited to an assessment of antral follicle dynamics and cannot inform on earlier stages of folliculogenesis. This study was observational and cannot address causation between obesity and altered antral follicle dynamics. Lastly, the data cannot be extrapolated to account for reduced fecundity and fertility in obesity.


WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS
The increasing global prevalence of obesity necessitates an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie obesity-related adverse reproductive health outcomes. Eumenorrheic women with obesity demonstrate altered ovarian antral follicle and endocrine dynamics compared to their counterparts without obesity. The degree to which abnormal granulosa cell assembly and/or activity underlie the suboptimal luteinization and subfertility requires further investigation.

Changes in the epidemiology of pediatric sinogenic and otogenic intracranial infections during the COVID-19 pandemic: a single-institution study.,"OBJECTIVE
Focal intracranial infections (epidural abscesses, subdural empyemas, and intraparenchymal abscesses) are uncommon complications of sinusitis and otitis media but can be associated with significant morbidity. Treatment typically requires neurosurgical and otolaryngological interventions in combination with antibiotic treatment. Historically, children have presented to the authors' pediatric referral center with sinusitis- or otitis media-related intracranial infections in low numbers. However, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of intracranial pyogenic complications has increased at this center. The objective of this study was to compare the epidemiology, severity, microbial causes, and management of pediatric sinusitis- and otitis-related intracranial infections in the periods before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.


METHODS
All patients 21 years of age or younger who presented with an intracranial infection in the setting of sinusitis or otitis media and who underwent neurosurgical treatment at Connecticut Children's from January 2012 to December 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were systematically collated, and variables before and during COVID-19 were compared statistically.


RESULTS
Overall, 18 patients were treated for sinusitis-related (n = 16) or otitis media-related (n = 2) intracranial infections during the study period. Ten patients (56%) presented from January 2012 to February 2020, none from March 2020 to June 2021, and 8 (44%) from July 2021 to December 2022. There were no significant demographic differences between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 cohorts. The 10 patients in the pre-COVID-19 cohort underwent a total of 15 neurosurgical and 10 otolaryngological procedures, while the 8 patients in the COVID-19 cohort underwent a total of 12 neurosurgical and 10 otolaryngological procedures. Surgically obtained wound cultures yielded a variety of organisms; Streptococcus constellatus/S. anginosus/S. intermedius were more prevalent in the COVID-19 cohort (87.5% vs 0%, p < 0.001) as was Parvimonas micra (62.5% vs 0%, p = 0.007).


CONCLUSIONS
At an institutional level, there has been an approximately threefold increase in cases of sinusitis- and otitis media-related intracranial infections during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multicenter studies are needed to confirm this observation and to investigate whether the mechanisms of infection are related directly to SARS-CoV-2, changes in the respiratory flora, or delayed care. The next steps will include expansion of this study to other pediatric centers throughout the United States and Canada.",2023,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0bbe1055a95cb6a7d412aa731dbd2cc770fb7ced,0bbe1055a95cb6a7d412aa731dbd2cc770fb7ced,"[{'authorId': '2151806772', 'name': 'Sophia J Angelo'}, {'authorId': '2193127039', 'name': 'Megan G.

Gut Microbiota and Its Repercussion in Parkinson’s Disease: A Systematic Review in Occidental Patients,"(1) Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a relatively common and complex pathology, and some of its mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Change in host microbiota is related to the pathophysiology of numerous diseases. This systematic review aims to gather existing data on the occidental hemisphere, compare it, and search for any significant association between Parkinson’s disease and gut microbiota dysbiosis. (2) Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) protocols were used for this systematic review. PubMed was used as the database search engine. Of the 166 studies found, only 10 were used, as they met our inclusion criteria: case–control studies, studies that assessed the correlation of PD and gut microbiome, studies that took place in occidental regions, and studies that were performed on humans and were written in English. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale was used as the assessment tool for overall risk of bias in this systematic review. (3) Results: The studies analyzed were divided into three geographic areas: Region 1: United States of America and Canada; Region 2: Germany, Ireland, and Finland; and Region 3: Italy; based on geographical similarities among these populations. The following statistically significant results were described in PD patients, compared with non-PD controls. In the first region, a significant increase in the following bacteria was seen: 1. Phylum: Actinobacteriota and its Genus: Bifidobacterium; 2. Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota and its Genus: Akkermansia; 3. Genus: Enterococcus, Hungatella, Lactobacillus, and Oscillospira of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 4. Family: Ruminococcaceae of Phylum: Firmicutes; 5. Phylum: Bacteroidetes and its Genus: Bacteroides; 6. Phylum: Proteobacteria. A significant decrease was described in the Family: Lachnospiraceae and its Genus: Blautia, Coprococcus, and Roseburia, which belong to the Phylum: Firmicutes. In the second region, a raised number of: 1. Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota, its Genus: Akkermansia, and its Species: Akkermansia muciniphila; 2. Family: Verrucomicrobiaceae of the Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota; 3. Genus: Lactobacillus and Roseburia of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 4. Family: Lactobacillaceae of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 5. Family: Barnesiellaceae of the Phylum: Bacteroidetes; 6. Genus: Bifidobacterium of the Phylum: Actinobacteriota; 7. Species: Bilophila wadsworthia of the Phylum: Thermodesulfobacteriota, was identified. Only one Genus: Prevotella of the Phylum: Bacteroidetes was decreased. In the third and last region, an augmented number of these bacteria were found: 1. Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota and its Genus: Akkermansia; 2. Family: Bifidobacteriaceae and Coriobacteriaceae of the Phylum: Actinobacteriota; 3. Phylum: Firmicutes and its Family: Christensenellaceae and Lactobacillaceae; 4. Family: Enterococcaceae and its Genus: Enterococcus, of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 5. Genus: Lactococcus and Oscillospira, of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 6. Phylum: Proteobacteria, its Family: Enterobacteriaceae, and the Genus: Citrobacter, Klebsiella, Salmonella, and Shigella; 7. Genus: ParaBacteroides of the Phylum: Bacteroidetes. In contrast, a significant decrease in 1. Phylum: Firmicutes, its Family: Lachnospiraceae, and its Genus: Roseburia and 2. Genus: Ruminococcus of the Phylum: Firmicutes, was described. (4) Conclusion: A significant gut dysbiosis, involving multiple bacterial taxa, was found in PD patients compared to healthy people in the occidental regions. However, more studies are needed to find the precise pathophysiologic involvement of other groups of pathogens, such as fungi and parasites, in the development and progression of PD.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff92d938819c3585e7d69f8683b0bbfe889398a4,ff92d938819c3585e7d69f8683b0bbfe889398a4,"[{'authorId': '2220468603', 'name': 'Ana Cristina Proano'}, {'authorId': '2220468605', 'name': 'Javier A.

Impact of lifestyle-based interventions on absolute cardiovascular disease risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective: The objective of the review was to synthesize the evidence of the effectiveness of lifestyle-based interventions for mitigating absolute cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Introduction: Evidence-based guidelines recommend employing an absolute CVD risk score to inform the selection and intensity of preventive interventions. However, studies employing this strategy have reported mixed results, hence the need for a systematic review of the current evidence. Inclusion criteria: Studies published in English that included a lifestyle-based intervention to mitigate CVD risk were considered. Studies were eligible if they enrolled individuals aged ≥18 years, with no history of CVD at baseline. The primary outcome was change in absolute CVD risk score post-intervention. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL searches were conducted from database inception to February 2022. The trial registers searched included Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and ClinicalTrials.gov. Searches for unpublished studies/gray literature were conducted in ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, GreyLit Report, and OCLC First Search Proceedings. Two independent reviewers selected the studies and critically appraised them for methodological quality using JBI tools. Data extraction was performed for main outcome variables. Data were presented using separate pooled statistical meta-analysis for quasi-experimental and randomized clinical trials. Random effects models were employed in the analyses. Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were expressed as standardized mean difference at 95% CI. Heterogeneity was assessed via Cochran’s Q statistic, and the inconsistency index (I 2) was used to describe variability in effect estimates due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. Results: Twenty-nine studies with a total sample of 5490 adults with no CVD at baseline were included. Fifteen were randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n=3605) and 14 were quasi-experimental studies (n=1885). The studies were conducted in Europe (n=18), the United States (n = 5), Asia (n=3), Mexico (n=1), Canada (n = 1), and Australia (n=1) and included the following lifestyle interventions: diet, physical activity, motivational interviewing, problem-solving, psychological counseling, cardiovascular risk assessment and feedback, health self-management education, and peer support. Six validated absolute CVD risk assessment tools were used to measure the study outcomes, including Framingham, SCORE, Heart Health Risk Assessment Score, Dundee, ASSIGN, and The UK Prospective Diabetes Study risk score. Overall, the methodological rigor of the RCTs and quasi-experimental studies was high. Of the 15 RCTs included in the meta-analysis, lifestyle intervention was favored over control in reducing absolute CVD risk score (Cohen’s d = –0.39; P=0.032; Z= –2.14; I 2 = 96). Similarly, in the 14 quasi-experimental studies, the absolute CVD risk score after lifestyle intervention was significantly lower compared to baseline (Cohen’s d = –0.39; P<0.001; Z= –3.54; I 2 = 88). RCTs that combined diet and physical activity reported no significant impact on absolute CVD risk score, but those that used either intervention independently reported significant improvement in the absolute CVD risk score. Conclusions: There is evidence supporting the positive impact of lifestyle modification on absolute CVD risk score in adult populations without CVD. Our analysis further suggests that diet and physical activity had significant impact on absolute CVD risk, and a variety of validated screening tools can be used to monitor, evaluate, and communicate changes in absolute risk score after lifestyle modification.

In 2018, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) established mass migration as a priority health issue in national, sub-regional, and regional agendas (1). In recent years, two simultaneous mass migratory phenomena in the Americas are occurring as people from Central American countries and Venezuela migrate to other countries in the Region. As of December 2022, approximately 7.13 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants had left their country, with 5.99 million relocating to other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (2). Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador bear the heaviest burden of migration, with over 4.47 million migrants from Venezuela currently being hosted in those countries. The United Nations Refugee Agency has called this “the largest displacement of people in the history of Latin America” with Venezuelan migration second only to Syria (3). By late 2020, there were an estimated 715 000 refugees and asylum seekers globally from Central America and Mexico en route to the United States and Canada; there has been a sharp increase since January 2022 which is estimated could result in half a million migrants requiring humanitarian assistance (4,5). Most of the refugees and asylum seekers from the Region were from three countries in particular: Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, also known as the Northern Triangle, with a notable increase of individuals from Nicaragua, as well as from Cuba, Haiti, and Venezuela (4,5). According to Doctors Without Borders, about half a million people flee violence and poverty from Central America towards North America each year (6). Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) are integral to health and ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health services among migrants remains an important public health priority (7). There is evidence suggesting that migrants may have limited access to sexual and reproductive health services and may face specific threats to their SRHR (8–10). Sex and gender-defined roles impact the experience of migrants and refugees everywhere; women and girls are significantly affected in both sudden and slow-onset humanitarian crises and face multiple SRHR challenges, as do lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex persons (LGBTQI+) and sexual minorities (11–13). These challenges are often associated with increased exposure to sexual and gender-based violence, increased rates of complications during pregnancy and post-pregnancy, complications due to unsafe abortions, and increased rates and suboptimal management of sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS, among others (9–11). The mass migration observed in Latin America has added pressure on the health systems of countries receiving these sudden influxes of people in a short timeframe (14). The need for context-specific and locally led evidence generation on issues related to health and mass migration has become paramount. This is particularly relevant for migrants’ SRHR, risks of infectious diseases, and with regards to the health system capacity to address their needs.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e37c0bc565c9d834f7b5938e3e80e31f9bfdc5a,2e37c0bc565c9d834f7b5938e3e80e31f9bfdc5a,"[{'authorId': '14108633', 'name': 'Vanessa Brizuela'}, {'authorId': '143763239', 'name': 'L.

Real-World User Demographics of Three Web-Based Digital Mental Health Interventions Provided by the US Department of Veterans Affairs: Observational Study Using Web Analytics Data,"Background Unguided digital mental health interventions (UDMHIs) have the potential to provide low-cost and effective mental health care at scale. Controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of UDMHIs to address mental health symptoms and conditions. However, few previous publications have described the demographics of real-world users of UDMHIs that are freely available to the public. The US Department of Veterans Affairs has created and hosts several UDMHIs on its Veteran Training Portal website. These web-based, free-to-use, and publicly available UDMHIs include Path to Better Sleep, Anger and Irritability Management Skills, and Moving Forward, which focus on insomnia, problematic anger, and depression symptoms, respectively. Objective This study aimed to examine the user demographics of these 3 UDMHIs in the year 2021. In addition, it aimed to compare the age and gender distribution of the users of those 3 UDMHIs with one another and with the age and gender distribution of the total US veteran population. Methods Google Analytics was used to collect user data for each of the 3 UDMHIs. The age and gender distribution of the users of each UDMHI was compared with that of the other UDMHIs as well as with that of the overall US veteran population using chi-square tests. Information on the total number of users, the country they were in, and the devices they used to access the UDMHIs was also collected and reported. Results In 2021, the 3 UDMHIs together recorded 29,306 unique users. The estimated age range and gender were available for 24.12% (7068/29,306) of those users. Each UDMHI’s age and gender distribution significantly differed from that of the other UDMHIs and from that of the overall US veteran population (P<.001 on all chi-square tests). Women and younger age groups were overrepresented among UDMHI users compared with the overall US veteran population. The majority of devices used to access the UDMHIs were desktop or laptop devices, although a substantial proportion of devices used were mobile devices (10,199/29,752, 34.28%). Most users (27,789/29,748, 93.41%) were located in the United States, with users from Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia accounting for another 2.61% (775/29,748) of total users. Conclusions Our use of Google Analytics data provided useful information about the users of 3 free and publicly available UDMHIs provided by the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Although our findings should be considered in light of the limitations of autonomously collected web analytics data, they still offer useful information for health care policy makers, administrators, and UDMHI developers.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/576aa1c22cc914d19d2244e3a3b468bfa91483ef,576aa1c22cc914d19d2244e3a3b468bfa91483ef,"[{'authorId': '15369001', 'name': 'A.

"Rights, not rescue: trafficking (in)securities at the sport mega-event","We examine the impact of fantasies used in the redevelopment of sport mega-event cities on host communities; particularly as related to the male-dominated FIFA World Cup and forced prostitution. We start with a discussion of event fantasies, particularly those that circulate in relation to humanitarian aid and the alleged involvement of women and children in forced labour and sexual exploitation. We trace these fantasies across several FIFA host cities since the 2006 FIFA World Cup, hosted in Germany, to leverage continual and perpetuate attention (and profit) through the non-profit industrial complex. These fantasies have facilitated and coordinated collaborative consensus amongst state authorities and allies to act in a meaningful manner even as the evidence of forced prostitution is still scant—while the realities of people that continue to be subjected to violent and exploitative labour in the construction of stadia, athlete recruitment, or equipment and apparel industries are seldom addressed. We do this to question the lived impact of policies and personalities of rescue on people engaged, consensually, in erotic labour within host cities, that are often made target of rescue intervention. The figure of the proverbial sex slave, as a highly racialized and hypersexualized trope, is mobilized through the sport mega-event to further police the bodies of all women in labour and migration. We end with a cautious message to future host cities, particularly cities implicated in the 2026 FIFA World Cup within Mexico, Canada, and the United States, of the highly-profitable and politically-advantageous rhetoric of damsel in distress.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/56498158df1fcab7f44520a7f4f5c6a69b3e3c64,56498158df1fcab7f44520a7f4f5c6a69b3e3c64,"[{'authorId': '2240177087', 'name': 'Benton J.

Application of Sustainability Index of Tidal River Management (SITRM) in the Lower Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna Delta,"The sustainability index (SI) is a relatively new concept for measuring the performance of water resource systems over long time periods. The purpose of its definition is to provide an indication of the integral behavior of the system with regard to possible undesired consequences if a misbalance in available and required waters occurs. Therefore, the tidal river management (TRM) approach has been implemented for the past three decades (from 1990 to 2020) within the polder system in Southwest Bangladesh to achieve water sustainability. TRM plan and watershed management plan (WMP) have commonalities as both are aimed at ensuring the sustainable use of watershed resources with the management of land, water, and the wider ecosystem of the watershed in an integrated way. The TRM plan focuses mostly on coastal regions, whereas the WMP focuses on both coastal and non-coastal regions. According to this, the aim of this study was to explore the application of the sustainability index of tidal river management (SITRM) in measuring the sustainability of tidal river management in the coastal area of the Lower Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna (GBM) delta. In order to quantify the sustainability of tidal river management, this research first provided the components and indicators of SITRM for the coastal region. The study follows a 5-point Likert scale for opinion survey of key informants and comprises households’ survey of farmers. In addition, it includes Landsat satellite images from Earth Explorer of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and direct field observation to collect information regarding the indicators of SITRM. The study measures the index value of SITRM for identifying the water sustainability of Beel East Khukshia-TRM. The index value was 71.8 out of 100, showing good tidal river management for the Hari–Teka–Bhadra catchment. To achieve water sustainability and aid stakeholders and water managers in decision making, it may be possible to include the SITRM framework in tidal river management projects. In addition, the SITRM is more capable of facing drainage congestion, waterlogging, and climate change issues than watershed sustainability index (WSI), Canadian water sustainability index (CWSI), West Java water sustainability index (WJWSI), and water poverty index (WPI). Therefore, water professionals and policymakers can apply SITRM to assess the resilience of specific TRM schemes for greater sustainability in different coastal regions of the world.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4490f6a64749b47ff450dde0a1cde01a1060cb6c,4490f6a64749b47ff450dde0a1cde01a1060cb6c,"[{'authorId': '112836604', 'name': 'M.

Peace Beyond the Binary: A Creative Intersectional Perspective on Global Forced Displacement.,"In a defiant celebration of their queer subculture at the end of the first act, the lead character exclaims: ""the opposite of war isn't peace-it's creation!""1 This lyrical moment spotlights how peace cannot be a crucial determinant of health and well-being if underlying systems of power remain the same;when addressing forced displacement on a global scale, public health responses must instead prioritize dismantling binary social constructs and intentionally creating inclusive care systems. The global COVID-19 pandemic has intensified existing cycles of violence and displacement generated by structural inequality, poverty, the climate crisis, and political instability.2,3 These systems operate through divisive, binary social categories-rich and poor, woman and man, Black and White, perpetrator and victim, citizen and foreigner- making people at the intersection of marginalized identity dimensions increasingly vulnerable to violence and forced migration within and across societies.4 Binary frameworks also determine which displaced populations receive refugee designation and, thus, protection. A study of transgender asylum seekers in Mexico found that they experienced discrimination in education and employment based on their evolving gender identities, violence from both their families and state officials, and adverse mental health outcomes.6 In another study, LGBTQ+ refugees and asylees living in a range of contexts in the United States and Canada reported widespread experiences of violence and a lack of support resources and protection across institutional levels and locations.7 These studies highlight how refugees who transcend binary constructs face violence and displacement not just from their communities but also from a migrant protection apparatus designed for refugees whose identities are assumed to fit neatly into predetermined boxes. Kimberlé Crenshaw's original use of the framework explored how binary conceptions of gender and race in the US legal system produced differential access to systems of justice for women who had experienced violence;the structural separation of racial discrimination and gender discrimination privileged White women's and Black men's experiences and obscured the cross-cutting effects of gender and race for Black women.8 In seeking to address forced displacement, I argue that we must incorporate an expanded version of intersectionality- what I call ""creative intersectionality""- that explores how global systems of power relate to and shape one another, recognizes that identity dimensions are not dichotomous nor essential but are developed by translocational experiences and sociocultural contexts, and prioritizes critical action to deconstruct binaries in favor of new systems for collective well-being.9,10 For example, using creative intersectionality as a lens to understand and ultimately address forced displacement requires that we examine all forms of binary constructs, and not just those imposed on an individual's identity dimensions.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a25501a95c9fa5fc7e20d852651b79955fcfd15,1a25501a95c9fa5fc7e20d852651b79955fcfd15,"[{'authorId': '2051352448', 'name': 'Alli Gillespie'}]"
"EURAMET supplementary comparison of personal dose equivalent rate at 0.07 mm and 3 mm depth, H p(0.07) and H p﻿(3), for beta radiation","For quality assurance in the realization and transfer of the unit of the absorbed dose rate at 0.07 mm tissue depth for beta radiation by the national standard laboratories, comparison measurements, especially between the primary standard facilities are needed. A corresponding comparison took place from 2004 to 2007 as EUROMET project No. 739. The comparison described in this report took place from 2018 to 2023 with the following extensions: instead of only eight laboratories, this time 16 participants from all parts of the world (five continents) were included; besides the absorbed dose rate at 0.07 mm tissue depth, 3 mm tissue depth was included for the first time; three different types of primary standards and radiation sources of four differing design types were used; one laboratory participated at an extreme altitude of 3000 m above sea level which required a very significant correction for air density to the dose rate; finally, besides the long-established beta reference radiation fields from the three radio nuclides instead of only eight laboratories, this time 16 participants from all parts of the world (five continents) were included; besides the absorbed dose rate at 0.07 mm tissue depth, 3 mm tissue depth was included for the first time; three different types of primary standards and radiation sources of four differing design types were used; one laboratory participated at an extreme altitude of 3000 m above sea level which required a very significant correction for air density to the dose rate; finally, besides the long-established beta reference radiation fields from the three radio nuclides 1. 147Pm with E̅ = 0.07 MeV and E max = 0.22 MeV, 2. 85Kr with E̅ = 0.25 MeV and E max = 0.7 MeV, and 3. 90Sr/90Y with E̅ = 0.8 MeV and E max = 2.3 MeV, also a fourth, i.e., a high-energy radiation field utilizing 4. 106Ru/106Rh with E̅ = 1.2 MeV and E max = 3.5 MeV, was included for the first time; all four in accordance with the international standard series ISO 6980 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). A flat ionization chamber accompanied by a complete measurement system was used as the transfer instrument for the comparison. The calibration coefficients of this chamber were compared in the reference fields listed above. The 16 participants were from Germany (PTB), Portugal (IST-LPSR), Spain (CIEMAT), Hungary (BFKH), Sweden (SSM), Finland (STUK), France (LNE-LNHB), China (NIM), Republic of Korea (KRISS), Taiwan (INER), Japan (NMIJ), South Africa (NMISA), Mexico (ININ), Canada (NRC), United States of America (NIST), and Cuba (CPHR). The PTB was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison ran under EURAMET Project No. 1398 and BIPM KCDB: EURAMET.RI(I)-S16.

"Sharing Milk: Intimacy, Materiality, and Bio-Communities of Practice","In the past few decades, opinions about informal or peer-topeer human milk sharing have fallen firmly in either the pro or con camp. Those who believe in prohibition of the practice include the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP; Meek et al., 2022), the Canadian Paediatric Society (Pound et al., 2020), and both the Human Milk Banking Association of North America and the European Milk Bank Association (EMBA & HMBANA, 2015). Most statements written against the practice rely on a single study by Geraghty et al. (2011) that found various unwelcome additions to the human milk they anonymously bought through various sources on the internet. Those in support of milk sharing include a growing cadre of researchers, many of whom have conducted indepth analyses of the practices, networks, and communities that exist as a result of this age-old practice (Falls, 2017; Gribble, 2013; Palmquist, 2015; Peregoy et al., 2021; Shaw & Morgan, 2017; Wilson, 2018). Another contribution to this expanding field is Sharing Milk: Intimacy, Materiality and Bio-Communities of Practice: sociologist Shannon Carter and medical anthropologist Beatriz Reyes-Foster’s study of a Central Florida milk sharing community based on in-depth interviews with 33 research participants, an online survey of 392 respondents, and actor-network techniques “following the milk” from donor to recipient. Similar to Fall’s (2017) White Gold: Stories of Breast Milk Sharing and Wilson’s (2018) Others’ Milk: The Potential of Exceptional Breastfeeding, Carter and ReyesFoster’s Sharing Milk provides intimate insight into nonnormative human milk feeding within the United States. Weaving personal stories of both the authors’ and participants’ milk sharing experiences and practices with theoretical analysis makes for a compelling read, albeit not hugely innovative given others’, but most notably Wilson’s, contributions. One distinctive observation, reinforced by the findings and analyses throughout Sharing Milk, is the dichotomy between milk sharing communities displaying “hyperadherence to recommendations by AAP and other public health agencies to feed babies breastmilk rather than formula” (p. 22), while at the same time violating these very same organizations’ prohibitive stance against the practice. While public health organizations may only value human milk under certain circumstances, both donors and recipients in Sharing Milk believe in the “biovalue” of expressed human milk. Carter and Reyes-Foster describe donors for whom “giving milk becomes hero work” (p. 51) and recipients who “cherish the gifts obtained” (p. 51). “Bio-intimacy” is built through the sharing of biological material between individuals; “emotional materiality” is created through the labor of producing and obtaining the milk. Sharing is seen as “antithetical to selling” (p. 50); the intimate, emotive value of milk is lost when a profit motive is introduced and “the sacred object [human milk] is contaminated and becomes profane” (p. 53). Shared community norms (like the rejection of the monetary commodification of milk) and common practices (like meeting face-to-face), together with the inherent creation of bio-intimacy, results in milk sharing bio-communities of practice. Sharing Milk once again demonstrates that the practices of milk sharing bio-communities does not follow the alarmist imaginings of the media and public health organizations. If there can only be one takeaway from this book, it ought to be Carter and Reyes-Foster’s concluding suggestion for “clarity and consistency in public health recommendations” (p. 172): if human milk is optimal nutrition, then public health organizations need to embrace milk sharing and provide guidance on risk reduction as has, for example, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (Sriraman et al., 2018). If, however, infant formula is more beneficial than informally-shared human milk, then “this message needs to be conveyed and publicized in ways that are clear, consistent and evidenced-based” (p. 172).",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/209b0fe3fcef3ca40daa12682830d1245fb7884e,209b0fe3fcef3ca40daa12682830d1245fb7884e,"[{'authorId': '100755110', 'name': 'Fiona Jardine'}]"

"An introduction to the Devonian Period, and the Devonian in New York State and North America","The Devonian strata in New York State were the standard section for North America for over 100 years, and remain a significant reference for regional to global correlation and research. Since publication of L. V. Rickard’s (1975) New York Devonian correlation chart, various higher-resolution stratigraphic analyses have been employed, sometimes at bed-by-bed scale. These include sequence-, bio-, event-, chemo-, and other -stratigraphic approaches, along with increasingly finer-resolution geochronologic dating of airfall volcanic tephras. Results have led to many new interpretations and insights of the succession. The purpose of this three-volume work is to produce a new Devonian stratigraphic synthesis for New York State, and to record, often in detail, current knowledge of the succession, and various other geologic and paleontologic aspects of it for current and future research and discussion. The purpose of this chapter is to provide overviews of the Devonian Period, the Devonian of North America (“Laurentia”), the Devonian of eastern Laurentia, and the Devonian of New York State. Furthermore, this review extends beyond the sedimentary rock and paleobiological record, and beyond the United States, Canada, and northern Mexico, to also summarize aspects of Devonian orogenesis, metasedimentary foreland basin fill, silicic igneous activity, complexities of terranes of Mexico and Central America, and Appalachian faunas that extended into South America. The Devonian Period as a whole encompasses 60 million years of time, approximately 419 to 359 million years ago. During that time, shallow seas covered large continental areas; climate was warmer globally than our current climate, during the late stage of a global greenhouse climate. By the end of the Devonian, that warm climate was descending into a time of global icehouse conditions, with widespread glaciation. The positions of modern continental masses were much different. During the Devonian Period, Life first fully colonized the land, led by primitive spore-bearing plants, small arthropods, and apparently by the Middle Devonian, the first tetrapod (“four-legged”) animals, which evolved from bony fishes. Decimeter-tall plants at the beginning of the period had evolved to tree-size forms by the Middle Devonian, approximately 30 million years later, and Earth’s first forest ecosystems arose. Devonian strata are widespread around the ancient continent “Laurentia,” which approximately corresponds to modern North America). At that time, Laurentia straddled the equator, with New York State and the Appalachian region somewhat north of 30° south latitude. Shallow epicontinental seas covered large but varying amounts of the continent over the period. Mountain belts formed on the eastern, northern, and western margins of Laurentia, due to plate tectonic collisions with smaller continental masses, exotic terranes, and volcanic island arcs. Through the Early to Middle Devonian, seas in western and eastern Laurentia were separated by a “transcontinental arch,” and generally had distinctly different marine faunas. In the latest Middle Devonian, sea level transgressed over the land barrier of the Laurentian Transcontinental Arch and the Canadian Shield, and those marine faunas mixed, leading to a more global cosmopolitan fauna in the Late Devonian. Anomalously, however, Early and Middle Devonian Laurentian shallow marine faunas are found in Devonian rocks in Central and South America, which were part of the southern Gondwana continent, generally thought to be separated from Laurentia by oceanic water depths at that time. During the Devonian, eastern Laurentia was an active tectonic margin, related to continent-continent collisions with various terranes/smaller continental masses. The Caledonian, Acadian, and Neoacadian orogenies resulted in compressional and some transpressional tectonics, and the uplift of an extensive mountain belt from east Greenland to Alabama and Georgia. Crustal loading of the orogen in eastern Laurentia led to subsidence and formation of a retroarc Acadian-Neoacadian Foreland Basin, which was initially filled with marine waters, followed by gradual overfilling to above sea level by massive volumes of synorogenic sediments from the east. The resulting lands were the site of some of the earliest forests on Earth, preserved at several sites in New York State, and forest ecosystems. Large-scale deformation, seismic activity, and metamorphism in the mountain belt were accompanied by igneous processes, including explosive eruption of felsic volcanic ash and other material, collectively termed “tephra,” also sometimes termed ash or tuff layers, or if diagenetically altered, sometimes termed bentonite, K-bentonite, metabentonite, or tonstein layers. These explosive Devonian eruptions sent volcanic tephra high into the atmosphere, and easterly winds spread airfall volcanic “tephra layers” across the eastern United States. Meanwhile, rock decay in the mountains led to the erosion, transport, and deposition of massive volumes of clays, silt, sand, and gravel into the Acadian-Neoacadian Foreland Basin, and beyond. Devonian rocks in New York are found at or just below the surface across approximately 40% of the state (~50,500 km2/19,500 mi2). The strata are generally undeformed and gently dipping, and while often covered by soil, glacial sediments, and vegetative cover, are relatively widely found in natural and man-made exposures. Three relatively thin intervals of carbonates are accompanied by eastward thickening wedges of synorogenic mudrocks, sandstones, and minor conglomerates. The history of geological and paleontological observation and study in New York began in the late 18th century. The first professional geologists appeared in the early 19th century. Since the advent of the first geological survey of New York State in 1836, the Devonian Period (nearly termed the “Erian Period” for New York’s Devonian-age rocks) has been the focus of a great volume of research which continues today. The Devonian succession in New York includes strata from all seven stages of the period, with erosional gaps of small to major significance. In addition to a range of marine facies, nearly one quarter of the entire area of Devonian bedrock in the state was deposited in terrestrial settings, with massive volumes of siliciclastic sediments shed off of Acadian-Neoacadian highlands to the east, that also feature the fossils of Earth’s oldest known forest ecosystems. The stratigraphic philosophy in New York has long evolved toward a hybrid classification, wherein groups, formations, and bed-level units are largely time-rock/allostratigraphic to occasionally chronostratigraphic, with lithostratigraphy often ascribed to member-level divisions (e.g., Pragian to Givetian strata, middle Lower to upper Middle Devonian). However, in some intervals, such as Frasnian strata (lower Upper Devonian), group-level units are time-rock units, and formation-level units within groups are largely lithostratigraphic. Forty-eight years of research since Rickard’s (1975) New York Devonian correlation chart permits development of a new, more refined chart (forthcoming), and also permits a new synthesis of Devonian rocks and fossils in New York, presented in this work of twelve chapters, with additional digital appendices.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00842e4432080af1d593e9bec5775e9cb270a7bc,00842e4432080af1d593e9bec5775e9cb270a7bc,"[{'authorId': '13755249', 'name': 'Charles Ver Straeten'}]"
MONETARY POLICY OF WORLD BANKS DURING THE PANDEMIC,"Each state chooses a certain type of monetary policy, which varies depending on external conditions, the state of the national economy, the level of technical and technological development of public production, employment, income level and other factors. Restrictive monetary policy is primarily aimed at suppressing inflation and reducing the money supply; it is carried out by restricting the possibilities of lending to legal and natural persons by commercial banks; it leads to a decrease in investments, a decrease in production, an increase in unemployment, and a decrease in savings of the population. As a result, the decrease in consumer demand slows down economic development. Expansionist monetary policy, on the contrary, is aimed at expanding the scale of lending to legal entities and individuals by lowering interest rates, reducing mandatory reserve norms, and easing control over the growth rate of the money supply in circulation. Its implementation leads to an increase in the amount of loans and investments allocated to the development of production, which creates conditions for the increase in the volume of production, jobs, incomes and savings of the population. As a result, the increase in consumer demand stimulates the growth of production.
The article is devoted to monetary policy and reactions of world central banks during the pandemic. The study analyzed the Japanese government's monetary policy during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Bank of England's response to Covid-19, and the Federal Reserve's policy response to the pandemic. Since the emergence of COVID-19, central banks around the world have taken emergency measures in coordination with fiscal authorities to mitigate negative effects on the economy and promote recovery. While monetary authorities have largely followed the scenario of the global financial crisis, the scope, scale and speed of the policy response to the pandemic has been unprecedented. Many central banks are turning to increasingly unorthodox approaches to monetary policy, particularly large-scale asset purchases, to boost economic growth. The central banks of Japan, Great Britain, the United States and the Eurozone have bought about $10.2 trillion worth of securities from their already large balance sheets since the outbreak, bringing their combined holdings to $25.9 trillion. The Fed has been buying $120 billion worth of securities each month, accumulating a total of $2.6 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and $5.5 trillion in US Treasuries. In addition to the current Asset Purchase Program (APP), the European Central Bank (ECB) has developed a €1.85 trillion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, which includes purchases of private and public sector securities.
The recovery of the Japanese economy remains fragile due to low rates of vaccination of the population and restrictions on the pandemic. The shortage of electronic components in the world can negatively affect the production of cars and their foreign deliveries. At the same time, a worrying factor is the emergence of signs of a slowdown in the Chinese economy. On April 7, 2020, the Japanese government adopted a 117.1 trillion-yen (20.9% of 2019 GDP) emergency economic relief package against COVID-19 and included the remainder of previously announced packages. Key measures included issuing cash to everyone and affected firms, tax and social security deferrals, and soft loans from public and private financial institutions. The Government of Japan announced the Second Draft Supplementary Budget for Fiscal Year 2020 on May 27, 2020.
The government has increased the amount of soft loans (interest-free and unsecured) primarily for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises affected by COVID-19. As a precautionary measure, the Parliament also approved an increase in the limit of government guarantees on capital injections in regional banks from 12 trillion yen to 15 trillion yen. On September 22, 2021, the Bank of Japan announced that it was keeping its monetary policy unchanged, but at the same time reported that the bank was carefully assessing the prospects for production and exports. The Bank of Japan maintained its assessment of the economic situation, saying that ""the growth trend is strengthening, although the economy remains difficult"". The bank is expected to keep the interest rate on short term deposits at minus 0.1% and on bonds maturing in 10 years at around 0%. Analysts note that this assessment was given on the eve of a change in the leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
Inflation is a limited phenomenon that manifests itself in a limited way in the markets for real goods and services. It can be provoked, among other things, by credit and deposit operations of commercial banks. Measures to combat inflation should be developed, as well as measures to measure it. US government debts are so large, so clearly unpaid, that the question of applying the institution of bankruptcy to individual municipalities has repeatedly arisen. Inflation-induced rise in interest rates will inevitably lead to an increase in the burden of servicing public debt. With a monetary policy aimed at targeting inflation in the region of 2%, the cost of attracting bond loans already at 7% will become the marginal value, after which a default is inevitable. The pandemic, and now its fourth wave is already underway, has objectively strengthened the trend of fencing off not only neighbors (Mexico and Canada), but also from the rest of the world.

"1391. ""Going Viral for Good: The Global Impact of #IDTwitter in the Infectious Diseases Twitter Community""","Abstract Background Twitter has become an invaluable resource for gaining insights into crucial developments in global healthcare communication. The hashtags (#) can be used to categorize tweets and gather conversations on a specific topic or to target a particular audience. Although the prevailing knowledge fund underlines the potential of digital networks to essentially influence the management of infectious diseases (ID), there has been no comprehensive analysis on the user information in the ID Twitter community, nor of the influence this hashtag has generated. The objective of our study was to evaluate the demographic data of #IDTwitter users, discern the most influential members and popular narratives in this realm, and ascertain the impact of the hashtag. Methods Using data from 28th June 2019 and 28th March 2023, an extensive analysis was conducted using the Symplur Signals research analytics tool. The analysis focused on the cumulative number of tweets, impressions, and unique users who shared tweets containing the hashtag #IDTwitter, with users categorized into specific healthcare stakeholder groups. The primary outcome measures were outreach and awareness measured by the number of tweets and impressions. Results The study observed the trends of #IDTwitter over a period of 45 months and found 441,650 tweets were shared by 92,734 users that generated a total of 1,833,037,732 impressions (views). Top five co-occurring hashtags were #IDtwitter, #MedTwitter, #MedEd, #COVID19, #TwitteRx. The top five countries reporting the greatest number of users of this hashtag were The United States of America (48326), Canada (4803), Mexico (3413), India (2759), Australia (2658). Various healthcare stakeholders’ categories were identified and three largest groups of contributors were Doctors (14.55%), Healthcare Providers (7.54%) and Researcher/Academic (3.70%). The top three influencers of this hashtag include two clinical pharmacists and one organization account. Country-wise distribution of Users of #IDTwitter The image shows the geographical distribution of the users who posted tweets containing #IDTwitter were shared (based on the locations at which the posting accounts were registered). Twitter is used worldwide for conversations regarding communicable diseases and their prevention, not only among the general public but also among students and professionals via online chat discussions and virtual rounds. Stakeholders of #IDTwitter Accounting for the percentage distribution of #IDTwitter-posting users in various healthcare stakeholders categories (data derived from Symplur Signals, with the classification being based on information provided in the Twitter biographies of the users- https://help.symplur.com/en/articles/103684-healthcare-stakeholder-segmentation). Twitter has become a quintessential tool for connecting people worldwide, and we can leverage this platform to our advantage by paying close attention to the topic and content of hashtag exchanges to combat misinformation related to matters like antibiotic usage or any epidemic infection on social media platforms. Top Co-occurring Hashtags The hashtags that generally appear alongside of #IDTwitter could provide an insight regarding the popular discussions involving #IDTwitter. Conclusion Our findings indicate that there is considerable interest in using #IDTwitter to promote relevant content and engage a geographically diverse audience. It underscores the vitality of professional voices in combating misinformation and we could definitely leverage this 'viral' hashtag for our advantage.

"Species diversity, hotspot congruence, and conservation of North American damselflies (Odonata: Zygoptera)","The rapid extinction of species is of considerable concern for biodiversity conservation. Identifying the drivers of species diversity and hotspots is beneficial for developing conservation strategies. Studies on insects have mainly focused on terrestrial species and rarely on semiaquatic species. Using 135,208 georeferenced occurrence records of 296 damselflies across North America, their species richness and endemism (represented by weighted endemism) patterns were mapped in a 100 × 100-km grid size, and the effects of environmental variables on species richness and endemism were investigated using generalized linear models and hierarchical partitioning. Subsequently, the top 5% grids with species richness and weighted endemism were separately selected as hotspots and their congruence was evaluated. Finally, species diversity hotspots were identified by integrating two types of hotspot grids, and gap analysis was performed to evaluate their conservation status. Temperature conditions and water availability had the strongest influence on species richness and endemism, respectively. Low congruence among species richness and endemism hotspots was observed. Moreover, four species diversity hotspots were identified, namely, region of the eastern United States and southeastern Canada, southwestern United States, central Mexico, and southernmost North America. Approximately 69.31% of the hotspot grids are not a part of the existing protected areas, presenting a significant conservation gap. The habitats of taxonomic groups should be considered while identifying the most common driving mechanisms of endemism. Strengthening the establishment of protected areas in regions with conservation gaps is urgently needed to promote the conservation of damselflies in North America.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/75255796aa5ba41850f4fdc5d77526cda862c353,75255796aa5ba41850f4fdc5d77526cda862c353,"[{'authorId': '2152620860', 'name': 'Zhengxue Zhao'}, {'authorId': '123042093', 'name': 'Xueli Feng'}, {'authorId': '2145049067', 'name': 'Yubo Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2157276816', 'name': 'Yingjian Wang'}, {'authorId': '5108261', 'name': 'Zhengxiang Zhou'}]"
How the effective reproductive number impacts global stock markets,"The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has impact the economies of countries across the world. In a short period of time, researchers have begun to analyse the effect of the pandemic on global stock markets. Although the most known measurements of COVID-19 are the number of new cases and deaths, there are more robust indicators. In particular, the effective reproductive number is one of the most important indicators to analyse the pandemic which indicates the degree to which the spread is under control. In this paper, we assess the impact that the Effective Reproductive Number (Rt) has on 26 countries around the world (32 stock market indexes) comparing the performance of various forms of Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models. The results demonstrate that of the 32 stock markets analysed, 37.5% had a negative effect with respect to Rt and only in 12.5% of the cases was the effect of the variation of Rt positive. This implies that in more than a third of the stock markets analysed as the pandemic progressed uncontrolled the result was a decrease in the value of the market index. The 11 of the 26 countries analysed had a negative and significant effect (Brazil, Germany, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Russia, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, and United States). Findings suggest that the Effective Reproductive Number volatility had a significant impact on 10 of the 26 countries analysed (38.5%) (Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Italy, Mexico, Russia, Singapore and United Kingdom). © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/da21654c7682615134f20b75da837608129f0fb7,da21654c7682615134f20b75da837608129f0fb7,"[{'authorId': '1721698', 'name': 'Werner D.

ASSESSING THE CURRENT THREAT OF MONKEYPOX EPIDEMIC EMERGENCE,"The purpose of this study was to assess the presence of threats of a pandemic based on the analysis of the prevalence of monkeypox globally in modern conditions. 
Materials and methods. The article is devoted to the analysis of cases of monkeypox in the world in 2022 and the evaluation of its pandemic potential in modern conditions. Official data of the World Health Organization, Public Health Centre of Ukraine, European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, USA were analyzed. 
Results and discussion. Taking into account the increasing scale of the monkeypox outbreak in the world, on July 23, 2022, the General Director of the World Health Organization declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international importance. During this period, more than 16 thousand cases of monkeypox were registered in 75 countries of the world. 
As of October 2, 2022, 68,900 laboratory-confirmed cases of monkeypox and 25 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization from 106 countries worldwide. Ten countries reporting the highest cumulative number of cases in the world are: United States of America (37.3%), Brazil (11.4%), Spain (10.4%), France (5.8%), Great Britain (5.3%), Germany (5.3%), Peru (3.8%), Colombia (3%), Mexico (2.4%) and Canada (2%). The smallest number was recorded in: Turkey and Indonesia (0.001% each); Moldova, Greenland and Georgia (0.002% each); Monaco (0.004%); Ukraine, Japan and Cuba (0.005% each); China, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia (0.007% each). In Ukraine, the first case of monkeypox was laboratory-confirmed in September 2022. As of October 27, 2022, 4 laboratory-confirmed cases of monkeypox by polymerase chain reaction testing were registered in Ukraine. 
Based on the analysis, the transmission of the monkeypox virus primarily occurs through person-to-person contact, often through sexual intercourse. Risk factors for monkeypox include being between the ages of 18 and 44, male gender, engaging in sexual contact with other men, participating in risky sexual behaviour, engaging in sexual contact without condom use, having a history of HIV infection or previous sexually transmitted infections (including syphilis). The following groups are considered at high risk: men who have sex with men, passengers in close proximity to an infected individual on airplanes, healthcare workers, close family members or friends, and anyone who has close contact with an infected person, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. There is a possibility of further spread of the monkeypox virus and the potential for the causative agent to evolve into a pathogen with greater epidemic potential than it currently possesses. 
People with monkeypox should avoid contact with animals during the entire period of isolation. In case of suspicion of disease in domestic animals, the veterinary service must be immediately notified. 
Conclusion. Currently, the pandemic potential of the virus is insignificant; monkeypox is less contagious compared to other infections that caused pandemics, it is transmitted only in conditions of close contact with a sick person, a contaminated object, or an infected animal. The cases are found in certain groups of behavioural risk. In order to better understand the variability of the epidemiology of monkeypox, the current and future trends in the development of the epidemic process of monkeypox, it is necessary to carry out constant surveillance.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/42a44cd41253fce35267375a213b4286511023b4,42a44cd41253fce35267375a213b4286511023b4,"[{'authorId': '147576039', 'name': 'M.

Editor's Corner,"I am introducing three more members of the American Antiquity (AAQ) Editorial Board. These dedicated individuals work tirelessly to help shape the mission and vision of the journal. After having introduced Stephen Acabado (UCLA), Sabrina Agarwal (Berkeley) and Michael Blakey (William and Mary), this column focuses on Lewis Borck (University of Oklahoma), Craig Cipolla (Tufts) and Alan Farahani (SciScope Solutions). Lewis Borck started his academic journey in community college and received his PhD from the University of Arizona in 2016. He is an assistant professor of Native American Studies and the Horizon Chair of Native American History and Culture at the University of Oklahoma, Norman. His research focuses on Indigenous rebellions, revolutions, and social movements that are missed or erased by archaeologists (Borck and Clark 2021) as well as how settler colonialism impacts heritage decisions and the construction of history (Borck 2019). He is a founding member of the Black Trowel Collective, a founding committee member of their microgrants mutual aid project for BIPOC and working-class archaeology students, and the founding president for The History Underground, an organization working to lower barriers for students from historically excluded communities entering archaeology and heritage work. His current research is in collaboration with the Jicarilla Apache Nation’s Tribal Historic Preservation office in northern New Mexico. Craig N. Cipolla received his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 2010. He is currently an assistant professor of anthropology at Tufts University. He has held academic positions in the United States, the UK, and Canada (spending time at the latter as a curator of North American archaeology). His research focuses on Indigenous-colonial histories ofNewEngland and theGreat Lakes, addressing issues of colonialism, collaborative methodologies, and archaeological theory. He has recently published several books, such as Archaeological Theory in the New Millennium: Introducing Current Perspectives (Harris and Cipolla 2017) and Archaeological Theory in Dialogue: Situating Relationality, Ontology, Posthumanism, and Indigenous Paradigms (Crellin et al. 2020). He directs the Mohegan Archaeological Field School, a collaborative project with theMohegan Tribe of Connecticut, which focuses on historic colonial interactions and allows students to gain experience with collaborative Indigenous archaeology. Alan Farahani received his PhD from an interdisciplinary archaeology and history program (AHMA) at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2014. He was a Cotsen Institute of Archaeology Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California, Los Angeles from 2014 to 2018, and assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas , from 2018 until 2021. He is currently the founder of and analyst at SciScope Solutions, where he uses open-source programming platforms to design computational tools to facilitate the entry, organization, analysis, and visualization of data collected in the laboratory and field sciences, above all in anthropology and archaeology. His research interests lie in the socio-ecology of past foodways, using paleoethnobotany to study the mutual constitution of social organization and environment in the maintenance of agricultural strategies in the Holocene (Farahani 2018, 2021). He has conducted fieldwork in Armenia, Jordan, Iraqi Kurdistan, the Philippines, Tunisia, and Spain, as well as participating in projects from Las Capas, Arizona, and Joya de Ceren, El Salvador. Finally, he prioritizes transparency and integrity in research through the reproducibility of quantitative analyses.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/23ded746b7067ffbfaf83caa0111c17eeadbe73d,23ded746b7067ffbfaf83caa0111c17eeadbe73d,"[{'authorId': '23494766', 'name': 'Debra L Martin'}]"
Making Mexican Chicago: From Postwar Settlement to the Age of Gentrification by Mike Amezcua (review),"made on the legislative front. Indeed, the story told here is largely one of collusion between legislators, industrial employers, and, perhaps most surprisingly, the civil servants responsible for public health, all of whom tacitly agreed to tolerate the consequences of the fabrication of white lead in return for industrial progress and economic gain – what Rainhorn, following Geneviève Massard-Guilbaud, calls the cult of the “smoking chimney” (12). Moments of increased “perceptibility” of danger occurred in the 1840s and 1850s, when white zinc was proposed by some as a safe substitute for white lead, and again in the early 1900s, when the unions of building workers, especially house painters, mobilized and when France adopted, in 1909, legislation outlawing the use of lead paint. Yet the legislation adopted in 1919, only a decade later, which integrated industrial diseases, including lead poisoning, into workplace accidents legislation and thus compensated occurrences of such diseases, was a tacit recognition that white lead, like other toxins, had not disappeared from French workplaces. In the wake of the Great War, efforts by the International Labour Office, led by France, Belgium, and Italy, to draft international conventions banning or regulating the use of lead-based paint were ultimately successful, but met with significant resistance from Englishspeaking and German-speaking nations, as well as from Spain, which was, like Australia and the United States, an important producer of lead. Rainhorn ends her study by discussing the numerous cases of infantile lead poisoning brought to the public’s attention in late twentieth-century France. The vast majority of these cases involved the children of migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa, growing up in the inadequate housing of Parisian suburbs and ingesting the lead from the paint peeling off the walls of these apartments neglected by landlords and the state. As the author notes, what had for centuries been a workplace risk has become a larger environmental risk, one that was, incidentally, brought to the public’s attention again in 2019 when Paris’s famed Notre Dame Cathedral burned, releasing huge quantities of lead dust into the air. Rainhorn concludes her book by reflecting on the ultimately modest nature of the gains secured by periodic mobilizations around white lead and on the tenacity of our collective willingness to tolerate these everyday poisons. Blanc de plomb is anchored in the sociology of risk and deeply rooted in the international historiography, notably the social and environmental histories produced by scholars of France, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Its author also draws upon the work of Canadian historians such as Michelle Murphy, whose research on sick building syndrome did much to develop the concept of “regimes of perceptibility.” Canadian scholars, perhaps especially those studying histories of resource extraction, familiar with the consequences for workers of sustained contact with asbestos and silica, will find much to meditate here in this compelling and beautifully written work of historical research.

Parasites: The Inside Story,"P The Inside Story shows how parasites coexisted and spread around the world through host migration, particularly through humans, and researches their origin and evolution. The book describes how the choice of host has affected the successful survival of some parasites and avoidance of extinction. The authors show how parasites influence and manipulate their intermediate host, which makes them more visible and easier prey for the next host, causing the host to “look foolish.” The authors use novel and entertaining approaches to explore their subject, such as describing how the Israelite Jonah spent 3 days in the belly of a whale and what parasites he might have encountered during that 3-day stay. Another entertaining approach was participation in the parasite Olympics, where parasites earned medals according to their success and survival by choosing and adjusting to their hosts. Ascaris lumbricoides is a gold medal winner as one of the most durable internal parasites of humans. However, the book overlooked Strongyloides stercoralis, which can cause hyperinfection syndrome in immunocompromised hosts and is considered an emerging infectious disease and deserves an honorary Olympic medal. Babesiosis is another notable emerging parasitic disease that was overlooked. I appreciated the novel and appealing way in which the authors show how parasites affect other species and human lives, while also incorporating their nonharmful roles, as in the case of mutualism and commensalism. I loved the immense and vivid imagery used to describe the breathtaking basin of the Congo River but was saddened that many persons living along the river might not continue to see that beautiful scenery because of river blindness caused by Onchocerca volvulus. The stories, connections to real persons, and references to at least 3 movies and 1 television series indicate the detailed efforts involved in writing this book. The book has a high level of scientific detail as it dives into history, ecology, evolution, and future outlooks. The authors discuss how climate change is affecting parasite existence. An example is the migration of triatomine kissing bugs to the southern half of the United States, which might increase the risk for Trypanosoma cruzi transmission, causing Chagas disease (to which the book attributes Charles Darwin’s death, from an infection he acquired during a trip to South America). The authors also elaborate on international scientific collaboration during epidemiologic investigations, such as the collaboration between researchers from the United States and Mongolia during a hantavirus infection outbreak in New Mexico. Readers will learn about parasite eradication campaigns, some of which did not turn out well, as was the case for the Schistosoma mansoni eradication campaign in Egypt that resulted in populationwide infections with hepatitis C virus. The book has 29 color photos, making the stories only more vibrant, and helps in understanding parasite life cycles and in making diagnoses. This book will appeal to readers interested in emerging infectious diseases, nonparasitologists, scientists, and clinicians and is an admirable expedition into the amazing world of parasites.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4654f475630f38b150a637624817a85787cadf79,4654f475630f38b150a637624817a85787cadf79,"[{'authorId': '2270025783', 'name': 'Rezhan H.

Gynecologic oncology top-cited articles: an international analysis.,"The aim of this paper was to study the top-cited per year (CPY) original articles published in the leading subspecialty journals in gynecologic oncology and in the leading general obstetrics and gynecology journals. We used the Web of Science and iCite databases to mine the original articles and review articles in the field of gynecologic oncology in the following journals: Gynecologic Oncology, The International Journal of Gynecological Cancer, The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Obstetrics & Gynecology. Top CPY articles from the four journals were analyzed and compared in a two-time point analysis. A total of 23,252 original articles and reviews were identified. The 100 Top-CPY articles were published from 1983 to 2021. Seventy (70%) in Gynecologic Oncology journal, 20 (20%) in The International Journal of Gynecological Cancer, eight (8%) in Obstetrics & Gynecology and two (2%) in The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The most common study methodology was observational studies (20%), followed by guidelines/consensus papers (19%). The most common study topic was ovarian cancer (41%). North America originating authors composed 62% of the top CPY publications, followed by Europe (21%). The most common country of authorship was the United States (52%) followed by Canada (10%). CPY were similar in the publications before vs. after 2014 (P=.19). Study designs, study topics and continent of authorship were similar in both periods. The proportion of multi-center studies was higher after 2014 (66.6% vs. 28.8%, P=0.002) and the proportion of open access publications was higher after 2014 (66.6% vs. 15.4%, P<.001). Funded studies were more common after 2014 (75.0% vs. 53.8%, P=0.028). Ovarian cancer is the top CPY area of research in gynecologic oncology. This field is leaded by authors from the United States with multi-center studies proportion increasing in recent years. It is important to promote further high-quality research in other countries to disseminate knowledge and equality.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48c61d422fc13fc8725e0c54895c98350dbd9be5,48c61d422fc13fc8725e0c54895c98350dbd9be5,"[{'authorId': '2265413038', 'name': 'Gabriel Levin'}, {'authorId': '23213870', 'name': 'Y.

Premature deaths attributable to the consumption of ultra-processed foods: a comparative assessment modelling study in eight countries,"Background: Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are becoming dominant in the global food and supply. Prospective cohort studies have found an association between UPF dietary pattern and increased risk of several non-communicable diseases and all-cause mortality. In this study, we (1) estimated the risk of all-cause mortality associated for each 10% increase in the share of UPF consumption in the total energy intake; (2) estimated the population attributable fractions (PAF) and the total number of premature deaths attributable to the consumption of UPF in adults (30-69 years) from 8 selected countries. Methods: First, we performed a dose-response meta-analysis of observational cohort studies assessing the association between UPFs dietary pattern and all-cause mortality. As we found evidence of linearity, we estimated the pooled RR (and its 95% CI) for all-cause mortality per each 10% increment in the % UPF. Then, we estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of premature all-cause mortality attributable to UPF in 8 selected countries with relatively low (Colombia and Brazil), intermediate (Chile and Mexico), and high (Australia, Canada, UK, and US) UPF consumption. Results: We found a linear dose-response association between UPF intake and all-cause mortality, with a 2.7% increased risk of all-cause mortality per 10% increase in the % UPF. Considering the magnitude of the association between UPFs intake and all-cause mortality, and the dietary share of UPF in each of the 8 selected countries, we estimated that 4% (Colombia) to 14% (United Kingdom and United States) of premature deaths were attributable to UPF intake. Conclusions: Our findings support that UPF intake contributes significantly to the overall burden of disease in many countries and its reduction should be included in national dietary guideline recommendations and addressed in public policies.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/899dba3890bdafb17214d03441985e95a9f1f09e,899dba3890bdafb17214d03441985e95a9f1f09e,"[{'authorId': '8251248', 'name': 'E.
