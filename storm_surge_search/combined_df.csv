Quality analysis of water level series obtained by altimetric radar satellite along the São Francisco River,"ABSTRACT Radar altimeters are instruments carried on space missions and allow for determination of heights, particularly in oceans and ice sheets. The use of altimetry data on continental waters involves several challenges, such as the revisit frequency (typically 27 to 35 days), an accuracy of decimeters, data handling and processing, particularly for narrow rivers such as the São Francisco River (width<1km). Radar satellite altimetry has advantages over the conventional in situ monitoring network, including in terms of spatial coverage and global altimetric reference of data. Thus, altimetry data should be used as a complementary and/or alternative source to in situ data. In this context, this study consolidates and evaluates the altimetric series of five different altimetry missions: Envisat in two orbits, Saral, Sentinel 3-A, and Sentinel 3-B. The altimetry water level time series of 17 Virtual stations were compared with leveled gauging stations series to calculate absolute and relative errors. Ultimately, the errors varied from 0.13 m to 0.36 m in the best cases (41%), in line with recent literature. Sentinel-3 satellites showed the best RMSE absolute/relative results: 0.95/0.49 m (S-3A) and 0.96/0.52 m (S-3B). The second best RMSEs was Envisat-X (1.39/0.50 m), then Envisat (1.87/0.56 m) and Saral (1.74/0.60 m).",2021,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9eb7876b6f23d1ebc106c0bce3d26f300049f0aa,9eb7876b6f23d1ebc106c0bce3d26f300049f0aa,"Luana Kessia Lucas Alves Martins, P.

Glacier Movement Prediction through Computer Vision and Satellite Imagery,"Over the last decade, climate change has impacted Earths' atmosphere and environment more than anytime before. Glaciers are the most sensitive indicators of its impact. In this work, we model a glacier's evolution by applying computer vision algorithms on high-resolution satellite imagery. We detect changes in the ice coverage movement by applying a dense optical flow algorithm over an image time series covering a particular scene (region) and processed to extract the NDSI. We perform tests on the Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn (JAB) glacier in the Swiss Alps. Our results show that we are able to obtain relevant information by computing motion vectors across time. Furthermore, we observe small differences between our predicted NDSI and the observed values demonstrating the efficiency of the approach.",2021,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4bdb25801db33a594a3891b8ed5bfa8f0f52ea8e,4bdb25801db33a594a3891b8ed5bfa8f0f52ea8e,"Maria-Minerva Vonica, Andrei Ancuta, M.

Long Term Aquatic Vegetation Dynamics in Longgan Lake Using Landsat Time Series and Their Responses to Water Level Fluctuation,"Aquatic vegetation in shallow freshwater lakes are severely degraded worldwide, even though they are essential for inland ecosystem services. Detailed information about the long term variability of aquatic plants can help investigate the potential driving mechanisms and help mitigate the degradation. In this paper, based on Google Earth Engine cloud-computing platform, we made use of a 33-year (1987–2019) retrospective archive of moderate resolution Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI satellite images to estimate the extent changes in aquatic vegetation in Longgan Lake from Middle Yangtze River Basin in China using the modified enhanced vegetation index, including emerged, floating-leaved and floating macrophytes. The analysis of the long term dynamics of aquatic vegetation showed that aquatic vegetation were mainly distributed in the western part of the lake, where lake bottom elevation ranged from 11 to 12 m, with average water depth of less than 1 m in spring. The vegetation area variation for the 33-year period were divided into six stages. In years with heavy precipitation, the vegetation area decreased sharply. In the following years, the area normally restored. Aquatic vegetation area had a significant negative correlation with the spring water level and summer water level. The results showed that aquatic vegetation was negatively affected when water depth exceeded 2.5 m in May and 5 m in summer. It is recommended that water depth remain close to 1 m in spring and close to 3 m in summer for aquatic vegetation growth. Our study provide quantitative evidence that water-level fluctuations drive vegetation changes in Longgan Lake, and present a basis for sustainable lake restoration and management.",2020,11,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/224e94b452bbd61fdcfb856056162aff61ac586e,224e94b452bbd61fdcfb856056162aff61ac586e,"Wenxia Tan, Jindi Xing, Shao Yang, Gongliang Yu, Panpan Sun, Yan Jiang"
Validation of ICESat-2 Surface Water Level Product ATL13 with Near Real Time Gauge Data,"The NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) mission uses laser altimetry measurements to determine the elevations at point levels of Earth. ICESat-2, which is a successor to the ICESat-1 satellite mission is a continuation of this series and carries a sensor namely Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS). The key advancement of ICESat-2 is that it generates individual laser foot prints of nearly 14 m (in diameter) on the Earth’s surface, with each footprint separated by only 70 cm, a much higher resolution and sampling than the earlier mission. ATLAS works under the concept of multi-beam approach containing three pairs of strong and weak beams that produce data products containing global geolocated photon data and height data from land-ice, sea-ice, land/terrain, canopy, ocean surface, and inland water-bodies. From the Level 2 master product called ATL03 numerous sub-data product are generated and are made available to the public through the National Snow and Ice Data Center. One of the products namely ATL13 is a specialized geophysical data product that gives along-track and near-shore water surface height distribution within the water masks. In this article, results after validating ATL13 data product with 46 observations made with near real-time gauged data for 15 reservoirs/water bodies have been presented. The maximum uncertainty observed for this data product is at centimeter-level. A significant observation made from this study is that the heights of surface water level computed from strong beams (gt1r, gt2r, and gt3r) and weak beams (gt1l, gt2l, and gt3l) are occasionally having a variation of 5 to 10 centimeters relatively.",2020,15,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c1770f3a69a65382369e6b96976a778947452225,c1770f3a69a65382369e6b96976a778947452225,"G.

Large-Scale Precise Mapping of Agricultural Fields in Sentinel-2 Satellite Image Time Series,"This paper presents an approach for large-scale precise mapping of agricultural fields based on the analysis of Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) acquired by ESA Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite constellation. The approach has been developed in the framework of the ESA SEOM - Scientific Exploitation of Operational Missions - S2-4Sci Land and Water project. The goal is to design a flexible and automatic processing chain able to perform mapping in massive data. Here we focus on precision agriculture products generation at country level. In particular, the Country of study is Italy and the application goal is precision agriculture of single crop fields. To achieve this goal, two macro challenges are considered: (i) download and pre-processing of S2 SITS, and (ii) multi-temporal (MT) fine characterization of agricultural fields. Both challenges are addressed in an automatic way by exploiting and/or updating state-of-the-art methodologies. Promising results have been obtained over years 2017 and 2018 for Italy.",2020,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc8a36ef1435b660d6da287c4467ff6fe325caec,dc8a36ef1435b660d6da287c4467ff6fe325caec,"Yady Tatiana Solano Correa, Daniel Carcereri, F.

Defining a retracking manifold within a radargram stack to improve satellite altimetric water level over coastal seas: A feasibility study,"
 <p>Single-waveform retracking for satellite altimetry applications over coastal zones has reached its limits, obtaining decimeter-level accuracy. The existing retracking methods find a retracker offset in a waveform by analyzing the variation in backscattered power along the bin coordinate. This makes the retracking procedure strongly dependent on noise in backscattered power. Moreover, the success of such methods is only guaranteed for certain waveform types requiring cumbersome pre-processing steps including waveform classification.&#160;</p><p>With the launch of the operational Sentinel-3 series of the European Copernicus programme, the algorithms to obtain highly precise water level estimates over inland waters and coastal seas need to become more robust, efficient and fit for automated use. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to demonstrate the potential of developing a next-level retracking algorithm and, consequently, improve altimetric water level determination over coastal regions. To this end, neighboring waveforms are collected into a (single-pass) radargram and, then, such radargrams are stacked over time. These so-called (multi-pass) radargram stacks contain, unlike single waveforms, the full information on spatio-temporal variation of backscattered power over water surfaces.</p><p>The radargram stack eases the recognition of patterns like retracking gate, shoreline, tides, etc. Instead of a retracking gate as a point in the 1D waveform, in a 3D radargram stack a surface referred to as retracking manifold is to be determined.</p><p>The potential of our new approach will be demonstrated using Sentinel 3B data, pass number 655, over the Cuxhaven tide gauge station at the Wadden Sea.</p><p>The idea of waveform retracking by analyzing its spatio-temporal behavior in a 3D data structure opens new pathways for achieving robust and more accurate water level estimates from operational missions, e.g. Sentinel 3, and from future missions, e.g. SWOT, over inland waters and coastal seas.</p>

Using Satellite Thermal-Based Evapotranspiration Time Series for Defining Management Zones and Spatial Association to Local Attributes in a Vineyard,"A well-planned irrigation management strategy is crucial for successful wine grape production and is highly dependent on accurate assessments of water stress. Precision irrigation practices may benefit from the quantification of within-field spatial variability and temporal patterns of evapotranspiration (ET). A spatiotemporal modeling framework is proposed to delineate the vineyard into homogeneous areas (i.e., management zones) according to their ET patterns. The dataset for this study relied on ET retrievals from multiple satellite platforms, generating estimates at high spatial (30 m) and temporal (daily) resolutions for a Vitis vinifera Pinot noir vineyard in the Central Valley of California during the growing seasons of 2015-2018. Time-series decomposition was used to deconstruct the time series of each pixel into three components: long-term trend, seasonality, and remainder, which indicates daily fluctuations. For each time-series component, a time-series clustering (TSC) algorithm was applied to partition the time series of all pixels into homogeneous groups and generate TSC maps. The TSC maps were compared for spatial similarities using the V-measure statistic. A random forest (RF) classification algorithm was used for each TSC map against six environmental variables (elevation, slope, northness, lithology, topographic wetness index, and soil type) to check for spatial association between ET-TSC maps and the local characteristics in the vineyard. Finally, the TSC maps were used as independent variables against yield (ton ha-1) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess whether the TSC maps explained yield variability. The trend and seasonality TSC maps had a moderate spatial association (V = 0.49), while the remainder showed dissimilar spatial patterns to seasonality and trend. The RF model showed high error matrix-based prediction accuracy levels ranging between 86% and 90%. For the trend and seasonality models, the most important predictor was soil type, followed by elevation, while the remainder TSC was strongly linked with northness spatial variability. The yield levels corresponding to the two clusters in all TSC were significantly different. These findings enabled spatial quantification of ET time series at different temporal scales that may benefit within-season decision-making regarding the amounts, timing, intervals, and location of irrigation. The proposed framework may be applicable to other cases in both agricultural systems and environmental modeling.",2020,12,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08e8e8ed79433d6030ddfd56421e5c7c940d012a,08e8e8ed79433d6030ddfd56421e5c7c940d012a,"N.

ICESat‐2 Based River Surface Slope and Its Impact on Water Level Time Series From Satellite Altimetry,"The water surface slope (WSS) of rivers is essential for estimating flow velocity and discharge. It is also helpful as a correction applied to range measurements of satellite altimetry missions to derive water level time series at a virtual station. Using radar altimetry, WSS can only be roughly estimated and is limited to wide rivers because of its coarse spatiotemporal resolution. In contrast, the lidar sensor onboard Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat‐2) can also observe small rivers. Using ICESat‐2's unique measurement geometry with six parallel laser beams, we derive instantaneous WSS along and across the satellite's ground track, time‐variable WSS (with an average of 5 days of records in the studied epoch between October 2018 and October 2021), and average WSS on reach‐scale. Although the method can be applied globally, this study is limited to 815 reaches in Europe and North America where sufficient validation data is available. We compare the ICESat‐2 WSS with time‐variable WSS derived from multiple gauges and constant data from the “SWOT River Database.” For 89% of the studied reaches, ICESat‐2 can be used to estimate the average WSS with a median absolute error of 23 mm/km. We also show the possible performance gain at multiple virtual stations (VS) in the “Database for Hydrological Time Series of Inland Waters” (https://dahiti.dgfi.tum.de), applying the WSS as a correction for altimetry satellites' ground track variability. We correct 137 VS for the derived ICESat‐2 WSS and yield improvements in the root mean square error by up to 30 cm or 66%.",2022,11,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6836b03047358b5077488d23a4892c1613a3721d,6836b03047358b5077488d23a4892c1613a3721d,"D.

Water Body Mapping Using Long Time Series Sentinel-1 SAR Data in Poyang Lake,"Mapping water bodies with a high accuracy is necessary for water resource assessment, and mapping them rapidly is necessary for flood monitoring. Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China, and its wetland is one of the most important in the world. Poyang Lake is affected by floods from the Yangtze River basin every year, and the fluctuation of the water area and water level directly or indirectly affects the ecological environment of Poyang Lake. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is particularly suitable for large-scale water body mapping, as SAR allows data acquisition regardless of illumination and weather conditions. The two-satellite Sentinel-1 constellation, providing C-Band SAR data, passes over the Poyang Lake about five times a month. With its high temporal-spatial resolution, the Sentinel-1 SAR data can be used to accurately monitor the water body. After acquiring all the Sentinel-1 (1A and 1B) SAR data, to ensure the consistency of data processing, we propose the use of a Python and SeNtinel Application Platform (SNAP)-based engine (SARProcMod) to process the data and construct a Poyang Lake Sentinel-1 SAR dataset with a 10 m resolution. To extract water body information from Sentinel-1 SAR data, we propose an automatic classification engine based on a modified U-Net convolutional neural network (WaterUNet), which classifies all data using artificial sample datasets with a high validation accuracy. The results show that the maximum and minimum water areas in our study area were 2714.08 km2 on 20 July 2020, and 634.44 km2 on 4 January 2020. Compared to the water level data from the Poyang gauging station, the water area was highly correlated with the water level, with the correlation coefficient being up to 0.92 and the R2 from quadratic polynomial fitting up to 0.88; thus, the resulting relationship results can be used to estimate the water area or water level of Poyang Lake. According to the results, we can conclude that Sentinel-1 SAR and WaterUNet are very suitable for water body monitoring as well as emergency flood mapping.",2022,14,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/56426204254238aee0ab1b782085c21a1e62019f,56426204254238aee0ab1b782085c21a1e62019f,"G.

Efficient data-driven gap filling of satellite image time series using deep neural networks with partial convolutions,"
The abundance of gaps in satellite image time series often complicates the application of deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks for spatiotemporal modeling. Based on previous work in computer vision on image inpainting, this paper shows how three-dimensional spatiotemporal partial convolutions can be used as layers in neural networks to fill gaps in satellite image time series. To evaluate the approach, we apply a U-Net-like model on incomplete image time series of quasi-global carbon monoxide observations from the Sentinel-5P satellite. Prediction errors were comparable to two considered statistical approaches while computation times for predictions were up to three orders of magnitude faster, making the approach applicable to process large amounts of satellite data. Partial convolutions can be added as layers to other types of neural networks, making it relatively easy to integrate with existing deep learning models. However, the approach does not provide prediction uncertainties and further research is needed to understand and improve model transferability. The implementation of spatiotemporal partial convolutions and the U-Net-like model is available as open-source software.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c9cda15d615c1a726c391228600e4227af8d5214,c9cda15d615c1a726c391228600e4227af8d5214,M.

Spatiotemporal variations of water quality in Baiyangdian Lake in past 37 years based on Landsat time series images,"Based on 116-phase Landsat satellite remote sensing data between 1984 and 2021, this paper inverted the long-term distribution of water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen (DO), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) of the water in Baiyangdian Lake, and analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and variations of water quality in Baiyangdian Lake over 37 years. In terms of temporal scale, the inter-annual variation of DO shows certain stability, and the images with the proportion of pollution-free area reaching 90% or more account for 88.7% of the total, showing no pollution in terms of DO; In terms of ORP, the images with the proportion of pollution-free area reaching 90% or more account for 81.2% of the total, showing no pollution to light pollution; the inter-annual variation of Chl-a concentration shows certain volatility, and the overall performance is light-moderate pollution, but the pollution level has been alleviated in recent years; the pollution status of water quality in Baiyangdian Lake in terms of Chl-a and ORP has a certain correlation. In terms of spatial scale, the spatial distribution pattern of DO and ORP is stable, presenting the characteristic that most areas are pollution-free, and a few areas with more frequent human activities show light and moderate pollution.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96c30a5ef37b323c4b848fbf21606f0ddcae58df,96c30a5ef37b323c4b848fbf21606f0ddcae58df,"Minghua Cheng, Miao Jiang, Zhaoqiang Huang, H.

Monitoring and Analysis of Water Level–Water Storage Capacity Changes in Ngoring Lake Based on Multisource Remote Sensing Data,"Mastering the fluctuation of water levels and the water storage capacity of plateau lakes is greatly important for monitoring the water balance of the Tibetan Plateau and predicting regional and global climate change. The water level of plateau lakes is difficult to measure, and the ground measured data of long-time series are difficult to obtain. Ngoring Lake is considered in this study, using spaceborne single-photon lidar ICESat-2/ATL13 inland lake standard data products, the water level values provided by Hydroweb laboratory, and the image data of an optical remote sensing satellite. A new method is proposed in the absence of measured data. The method uses multisource remote sensing data to estimate the long-term changes in the water levels, surface area, and water storage capacity of Ngoring Lake in the past three decades. The results show that the water level values of ICESat-2 and Hydroweb on overlapping observation days are highly correlated, with R2 = 0.9776, MAE = 0.420 m, RMSE = 0.077 m, and the average absolute height difference is 0.049 m. The fusion of multiple altimetry data can obtain more continuous long-time series water-level observation results. From 1992 to 2021, the water body information of Ngoring Lake basin fluctuated greatly and showed different variation characteristics in different time periods. The lowest water level in January 1997 was approximately 4268.49 m, and it rose to its highest in October 2009, approximately 4272.44 m. The change in the water level in the basin was mainly affected by natural factors, such as precipitation, air temperature, and human activities. The analysis shows that ICESat-2 can be combined with other remote sensing data to realize the long-time series dynamic monitoring of plateau lakes, showing great advantages in the comprehensive observation of plateau lakes in no man’s land.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8840ce4b1a2be14baa3f07377463629d1c2f0a2d,8840ce4b1a2be14baa3f07377463629d1c2f0a2d,"W.

Long-Term Water Level Forecasting for El Yeso Reservoir using Time-Series Data and Satellite Images,"This study aims to perform long-term forecasting of monthly water levels from El Yeso Dam, one of the most important water reservoirs in Santiago, Chile. Leveraging a 14-year time-series climate data and satellite imagery, our investigation focuses on understanding the dynamics of water levels and their correlation with environmental factors. Landsat constellation images were extracted using the Google Earth Engine platform to examine the appearance of the dam and calculate the area of the water surface. Several experiments were performed using stochastic time series models such as SARIMAX and Recurrent Neural Networks, including SimpleRNN, LSTM, and GRU. The algorithms were validated through the examination of errors, analysis of performance criteria, and inspection of residuals. According to the results, the reservoir’s volume does not exhibit a sustained downward trend. On the contrary, a slight increase in water level is forecasted during the winter months and a significant rise is anticipated for the summer months. This suggests that the consistent temperature increase in the area due to climate change may contribute to the melting of the snow cover and surrounding glaciers, resulting in an increase in water levels. Therefore, this research contributes to the development of effective planning and management strategies for the region’s water resources.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/906f5cc1bf82fa8a130b72df91bf27262017d1a5,906f5cc1bf82fa8a130b72df91bf27262017d1a5,"Paulette Reyes-Baeza, Roxana Trujillo-Guiñez, Mabel Vidal"
Response of Guobu Slope Displacement to Rainfall and Reser-Voir Water Level with Time-Series InSAR and Wavelet Analysis,"Reservoir bank landslides are a frequent phenomenon, and the stability of these landslides is affected by two essential factors: rainfall and reservoir level changes. Studying the response patterns of reservoir bank landslide movements to these variables is crucial in preventing their occurrence and mitigating their effects. To this end, this study employed 103 European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus Sentinel-1 images and the SBAS-InSAR (small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar) technique to obtain a time series of the Guobu slope deformation from September 2015 to December 2019. The Guobu slope showed significant toppling damage. The satellite line of sight (LOS) detected a maximum subsidence rate of −447 mm/y (the negative sign indicates movement away from the satellite, i.e., subsidence) in the upper section of the slope. Subsequently, three wavelet tools were used to quantitatively analyze the effect of rainfall and reservoir water level on the deformation of the Guobu slope. The results demonstrate a positive correlation between rainfall and the deformation of the Guobu slope. Moreover, the deformation lags behind the rainfall by approximately 70 days. In contrast, the reservoir water level and the deformation of the Guobu slope exhibit an inverse relationship. The deformation of the leading edge of the slope body lags behind the reservoir level by approximately 19 days, while the middle and upper sections of the slope body, which have the most significant rate of variability, lag by about 80 days. Among these factors, rainfall plays a dominant role in the deformation of the Guobu slope, while reservoir levels play a synergistic role. The findings of this study highlight the importance of monitoring and understanding the impact of changes in rainfall and reservoir water levels on the stability of reservoir bank landslides. This understanding is crucial in preventing the occurrence of such landslides and minimizing their impact. The use of remote sensing techniques, together with wavelet analysis, enables the accurate and timely monitoring of the deformation of the Guobu slope, providing valuable insights for disaster warnings and disaster prevention and reduction efforts.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3cd9c25aec9433c69c84aa334da39e9ea55efb25,3cd9c25aec9433c69c84aa334da39e9ea55efb25,"L.

Monitoring of Wheat Crop Growth at Farm Level Using Time Series Multispectral Satellite Imagery,": The monitoring of wheat crop growth plays a crucial role in ensuring effective agricultural management and enhancing food security. Valuable insights into the spatial distribution and various growth stages of wheat crop can be obtained through the combination of multi-spectral remote sensing datasets, data analysis, and ground-truth veriﬁcation. This work aims to monitor wheat crops at farm level in the Bathinda district of India during the agricultural year 2022–23. It involves collecting and analyzing multispectral satellite data over ﬁve selected farmlands in the study region. Preprocessing of the multispectral satellite data is performed, including radiometric and atmospheric corrections. The wheat crops’ health and growth are examined, utilizing various indices such as the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), Normalized Difference Red Edge (NDRE), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) retrieved from time series remote sensing datasets. Furthermore, wheat crop monitoring is performed, using fortnightly data encompassing its health, moisture levels, and growth stages on individual farmlands. Different farmlands have shown varied LSWI, NDRE, and NDVI values. Variations in crop growth and productivity were observed among farmlands due to differences in soil properties and sowing dates.

Densifying and Optimizing the Water Level Series for Large Lakes from Multi-Orbit ICESat-2 Observations,"Satellite laser altimetry has been widely used for monitoring surface height changes in inland waters. However, constructing time series of water levels is partially limited in temporal resolution only based on the individual orbit of altimeter observations. To densify and optimize the time series of altimetry-based water levels is crucial to the scientific understanding of lake hydrologic dynamics. This paper focuses on synthesizing the multi-orbit on-lake observations from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) to densify and refine the water level time series for large lakes. The approach of synthesizing water level time series has been validated through experiments applied to 18 large lakes worldwide, resulting in an average R of 0.93, RMSE of 0.14 m, MAE of 0.12 m, NSE of 0.67, and CV of 2.86, according to the hydrologic gauge stations. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can provide an effective solution for densifying the water level series of large lakes covered by multi-orbit ICESat-2 observations. Further, the approach can be extended to monitor the high-frequency variation of other lakes covered by the multiple ICESat-2 orbits. This approach provides the potential of generating higher-frequency estimates of water levels based on satellite altimetry, which could not only help to reveal the characteristics of the seasonal dynamics of lakes but also be used to investigate the abrupt water level changes due to hydrological extreme events (e.g., floods, droughts, etc.).",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6fd820bd2eb31c2906f5a260df523a502652e63a,6fd820bd2eb31c2906f5a260df523a502652e63a,"Tan Chen, Chunqiao Song, Pengfei Zhan, Chenyu Fan"
Recovery of Time Series of Water Volume in Lake Ranco (South Chile) through Satellite Altimetry and Its Relationship with Climatic Phenomena,"In the context of escalating climate change-induced impacts on water resources, robust monitoring tools are imperative. Satellite altimetry, benefiting from technical improvement such as the use of SAR and InSAR techniques and tracking modes considering topography, is emerging as a crucial means of estimating lake levels, data that are fundamental to understanding climate dynamics. This study delves into the use of satellite-altimetry-determined water levels to analyze changes in water storage and superficial area in Lake Ranco, in south-central Chile, from 1995 to 2023. The main objective is to provide valuable information for water-resource management and policy formulation. Leveraging AlTiS software (v2.2.9-0-gf5938ab), radar-altimetry data from the missions ERS-2, ENVISAT, SARAL, and Sentinel-3A were processed, generating a complete time series of water levels. The lake-level data were complemented by the bathymetric data for the lake to obtain the variation in the area and volume in the period 1995–2023. These results were analyzed with respect to hydrometeorological data from the study area, such as precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, and potential evapotranspiration. Additionally, the effects of ENSO (ENSO 3.4 index) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDO) were considered. Results reveal a strong correlation between altimetry-derived lake levels and observed in situ data, with a mean square error of 0.04 m, a coefficient of determination of 0.99, an index of agreement of 0.99, and a Kling−Gupta efficiency of 0.90. The analysis of climatic variables showed that variations in lake level coincide with changes in precipitation within the study area and also showed the influence of variations in temperature and potential evapotranspiration. Additionally, the effects of the ENSO phenomenon can be seen within the study area for its cold phase (i.e., La Niña) in the 2010–2012 period and for its warm phase (i.e., El Niño) in the 2015–2016 period, with a decrease and increase in precipitation, respectively. These effects were enhanced when the cold and warm phases of the ENSO and PDO phenomena occured. The successful application of satellite altimetry demonstrated in this study underscores its critical role in advancing our understanding and management of water resources amidst changing climate scenarios.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e331d6f0dc886ad80d14053bf5cd4ef346498b93,e331d6f0dc886ad80d14053bf5cd4ef346498b93,"Patricio Fuentes-Aguilera, Lien Rodríguez-López, L.

Inland Water Level Monitoring from Satellite Observations: A Scoping Review of Current Advances and Future Opportunities,"Inland water level and its dynamics are key components in the global water cycle and land surface hydrology, significantly influencing climate variability and water resource management. Satellite observations, in particular altimetry missions, provide inland water level time series for nearly three decades. Space-based remote sensing is regarded as a cost-effective technique that provides measurements of global coverage and homogeneous accuracy in contrast to in-situ sensors. The advent of Open-Loop Tracking Command (OLTC), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode strengthened the use of altimetry missions for inland water level monitoring. However, it is still very challenging to obtain accurate measurements of water level over narrow rivers and small lakes. This scoping systematic literature review summarizes and disseminates the research findings, highlights major results, and presents the limitations regarding inland water level monitoring from satellite observations between 2018 and 2022. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline and through a double screening process, 48 scientific publications were selected meeting the eligibility criteria. To summarize the achievements of the previous 5 years, we present fundamental statistical results of the publications, such as the annual number of publications, scientific journals, keywords, and study regions per continent and type of inland water body. Also, publications associated with specific satellite missions were analyzed. The findings show that Sentinel-3 is the dominant satellite mission, while the ICESat-2 laser altimetry mission has exhibited a high growth trend. Furthermore, publications including radar altimetry missions were charted based on the retracking algorithms, presenting the novel and improved methods of the last five years. Moreover, this review confirms that there is a lack of research on the collaboration of altimetry data with machine learning techniques.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d5a1249a97919e5d6e5a10dafa9efd3bd77f1e86,d5a1249a97919e5d6e5a10dafa9efd3bd77f1e86,"S.

"Time Series Analysis of Water Quality Factors Enhancing Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs): A Study Integrating In-Situ and Satellite Data, Vaal Dam, South Africa","The Vaal Dam catchment, which is the source of potable water for Gauteng province, is characterized by diverse human activities, and the dam encounters significant nutrient input from multiple sources within its catchment. As a result, there has been a rise in Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) within the reservoir of the dam. In this study, we employed time series analysis on nutrient data to explore the relationship between HABs, using chlorophyll-a (Chl−a) as a proxy, and nutrient levels. Additionally, Chl−a data extracted from Landsat-8 satellite images was utilized to visualize the spatial distribution of HABs in the reservoir. Our findings revealed that HAB productivity in the Vaal Dam is influenced by the levels of total phosphorus (TP) and organic nitrogen (KJEL_N), which exhibited a positive correlation with chlorophyll-a (Chl−a) concentration. Long-term analysis of Chl−a in-situ data (1986–2022) collected at a specific point within the reservoir showed an average concentration of 11.25 μg/L. However, on certain stochastic dates, Chl−a concentration spiked to very high values, reaching a maximum of 452.8 μg/L, coinciding with elevated records of TP and KJEL_N concentrations on those dates, indicating their effect on productivity levels. The decadal time series and trend analysis demonstrated an increasing trend in Chl−a productivity over the studied period, rising from 4.75 μg/L in the first decade (1990–2000) to 10.51 μg/L in the second decade (2000–2010), and reaching 16.7 μg/L in the last decade (2010–2020). The rising averages of the decadal values were associated with increasing decadal averages of its driving factors, TP from 0.1043 to 0.1096 to 0.1119 mg/L for the three decades, respectively, and KJEL_N from 0.80 mg/L in the first decade to 1.14 mg/L in the last decade. Satellite data analysis during the last decade revealed that the spatial dynamics of HABs are influenced by the dam’s geometry and the levels of discharge from its two feeding rivers, with higher concentrations observed in meandering areas of the reservoir and within zones of restricted water circulation.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b5c8e29afc984e6316121ce8dcf2b1cf82405d6,4b5c8e29afc984e6316121ce8dcf2b1cf82405d6,"Altayeb A.

A Multi-Sensor Approach to Characterize Winter Water-Level Drawdown Patterns in Lakes,"Artificial manipulation of lake water levels through practices like winter water-level drawdown (WD) is prevalent across many regions, but the spatiotemporal patterns are not well documented due to limited in situ monitoring. Multi-sensor satellite remote sensing provides an opportunity to map and analyze drawdown frequency and metrics (timing, magnitude, duration) at broad scales. This study developed a cloud computing framework to process time series of synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel 1-SAR) and optical sensor (Landsat 8, Sentinel 2) data to characterize WD in 166 lakes across Massachusetts, USA, during 2016–2021. Comparisons with in situ logger data showed that the Sentinel 1-derived surface water area captured relative water-level fluctuations indicative of WD. A machine learning approach classified lakes as WD versus non-WD based on seasonal water-level fluctuations derived from Sentinel 1-SAR data. The framework mapped WD lakes statewide, revealing prevalence throughout Massachusetts with interannual variability. Results showed WDs occurred in over 75% of lakes during the study period, with high interannual variability in the number of lakes conducting WD. Mean WD magnitude was highest in the wettest year (2018) but % lake area exposure did not show any association with precipitation and varied between 8% to 12% over the 5-year period. WD start date was later and duration was longer in wet years, indicating climate mediation of WD implementation driven by management decisions. The data and tools developed provide an objective information resource to evaluate ecological impacts and guide management of this prevalent but understudied phenomenon. Overall, the results and interactive web tool developed as part of this study provide new hydrologic intelligence to inform water management and policies related to WD practices.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dfa93c49495d114fcf6afc8e17d605dddde2b513,dfa93c49495d114fcf6afc8e17d605dddde2b513,"Abhishek Kumar, Allison H.

Assessing macrophyte seasonal dynamics using dense time series of medium resolution satellite data,"Thanks to the improved spatial and temporal resolution of new generation Earth Observation missions, such as Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, the potential of remote sensing techniques in mapping land surface phenology of terrestrial biomes can now be tested in inland water systems. We assessed the capabilities of dense time series of medium resolution satellite data to deliver quantitative information about macrophyte phenology metrics, focusing on three temperate European shallow lakes with connected wetlands, located in Italy, France and Romania. Leaf area index (LAI) maps for floating and emergent macrophyte growth forms were derived from semi-empirical regression modelling based on the best performing spectral index, with an error level around 0.11 m2 m-2. Phenology metrics were computed from LAI time series using TIMESAT code and used to analyse macrophyte seasonal dynamics in terms of spatial patterns and species-dependent variability. Peculiar patterns of autochthonous and allochthonous species seasonality across the three study areas were related to the environmental characteristics of each area in terms of ecological and hydrological conditions. In addition, the influence of satellite dataset characteristics – i.e. cloud cover thresholding, temporal resolution and missing acquisitions – on phenology timing metrics retrieval was assessed. Results have shown that with full resolution (5-day revisit) time series, cloud cover can bias phenology timing metrics by less than 2 days, and that reducing temporal resolution to 15 days (similar to Landsat revisit) still allows for mapping the start and peak of macrophyte growth with an error level around 2–3 days.",2018,38,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1136d55fe1c54f2bae6a3edb0f2f1ad90991a639,1136d55fe1c54f2bae6a3edb0f2f1ad90991a639,"P.

Using Time Series of High-Resolution Planet Satellite Images to Monitor Grapevine Stem Water Potential in Commercial Vineyards,"Spectral-based vegetation indices (VI) have been shown to be good proxies of grapevine stem water potential (Ψstem), assisting in irrigation decision-making for commercial vineyards. However, VI-Ψstem correlations are mostly reported at the leaf or canopy scales, using proximal canopy-based sensors or very-high-spatial resolution images derived from sensors mounted on small airplanes or drones. Here, for the first time, we take advantage of high-spatial resolution (3-m) near-daily images acquired from Planet’s nano-satellite constellation to derive VI-Ψstem correlations at the vineyard scale. Weekly Ψstem was measured along the growing season of 2017 in six vines each in 81 commercial vineyards and in 60 pairs of grapevines in a 2.4 ha experimental vineyard in Israel. The Clip application programming interface (API), provided by Planet, and the Google Earth Engine platform were used to derive spatially continuous time series of four VIs—GNDVI, NDVI, EVI and SAVI—in the 82 vineyards. Results show that per-week multivariable linear models using variables extracted from VI time series successfully tracked spatial variations in Ψstem across the experimental vineyard (Pearson’s-r = 0.45–0.84; N = 60). A simple linear regression model enabled monitoring seasonal changes in Ψstem along the growing season in the vineyard (r = 0.80–0.82). Planet VIs and seasonal Ψstem data from the 82 vineyards were used to derive a ‘global’ model for in-season monitoring of Ψstem at the vineyard-level (r = 0.78; RMSE = 18.5%; N = 970). The ‘global’ model, which requires only a few VI variables extracted from Planet images, may be used for real-time weekly assessment of Ψstem in Mediterranean vineyards, substantially improving the efficiency of conventional in-field monitoring efforts.",2018,59,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8c4c4ef01f69c10f0d81f32bb17031dd6e10c96,a8c4c4ef01f69c10f0d81f32bb17031dd6e10c96,"D.

"Investigating compound flooding in an estuary using hydrodynamic modelling: a case study from the Shoalhaven River, Australia","Abstract. Many previous modelling studies have considered
storm-tide and riverine flooding independently, even though
joint-probability analysis highlighted significant dependence between
extreme rainfall and extreme storm surges in estuarine environments. This
study investigates compound flooding by quantifying horizontal and vertical
differences in coastal flood risk estimates resulting from a separation of
storm-tide and riverine flooding processes. We used an open-source version
of the Delft3D model to simulate flood extent and inundation depth due to a
storm event that occurred in June 2016 in the Shoalhaven Estuary,
south-eastern
Australia. Time series of observed water levels and discharge measurements
are used to force model boundaries, whereas observational data such as
satellite imagery, aerial photographs, tidal gauges and water level logger
measurements are used to validate modelling results. The comparison of
simulation results including and excluding riverine discharge demonstrated
large differences in modelled flood extents and inundation depths. A flood
risk assessment accounting only for storm-tide flooding would have
underestimated the flood extent of the June 2016 storm event by 30 %
(20.5 km 2 ). Furthermore, inundation depths would have been
underestimated on average by 0.34 m and by up to 1.5 m locally. We recommend
considering storm-tide and riverine flooding processes jointly in estuaries
with large catchment areas, which are known to have a quick response time to
extreme rainfall. In addition, comparison of different boundary set-ups at
the intermittent entrance in Shoalhaven Heads indicated that a permanent
opening, in order to reduce exposure to riverine flooding, would increase
tidal range and exposure to both storm-tide flooding and wave action.",2017,112,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9cb0a37b5345291465b7248408d1d8e5c3221c4c,9cb0a37b5345291465b7248408d1d8e5c3221c4c,"K. Kumbier, R. Carvalho, A. Vafeidis, C. Woodroffe"
Causal inference for climate change events from satellite image time series using computer vision and deep learning,"We propose a method for causal inference using satellite image time series, in order to determine the treatment effects of interventions which impact climate change, such as deforestation. Simply put, the aim is to quantify the 'before versus after' effect of climate related human driven interventions, such as urbanization; as well as natural disasters, such as hurricanes and forest fires. As a concrete example, we focus on quantifying forest tree cover change/ deforestation due to human led causes. The proposed method involves the following steps. First, we use computer vision and machine learning/deep learning techniques to detect and quantify forest tree coverage levels over time, at every time epoch. We then look at this time series to identify changepoints. Next, we estimate the expected (forest tree cover) values using a Bayesian structural causal model and projecting/forecasting the counterfactual. This is compared to the values actually observed post intervention, and the difference in the two values gives us the effect of the intervention (as compared to the non intervention scenario, i.e. what would have possibly happened without the intervention). As a specific use case, we analyze deforestation levels before and after the hyperinflation event (intervention) in Brazil (which ended in 1993-94), for the Amazon rainforest region, around Rondonia, Brazil. For this deforestation use case, using our causal inference framework can help causally attribute change/reduction in forest tree cover and increasing deforestation rates due to human activities at various points in time.",2019,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/024cc6018139369cfc9eecf76738418725ff5c2e,024cc6018139369cfc9eecf76738418725ff5c2e,V.

Land Cover Maps Production with High Resolution Satellite Image Time Series and Convolutional Neural Networks: Adaptations and Limits for Operational Systems,"The Sentinel-2 satellite mission offers high resolution multispectral time-series image data, enabling the production of detailed land cover maps globally. When mapping large territories, the trade-off between processing time and result quality is a central design decision. Currently, this machine learning task is usually performed using pixel-wise classification methods. However, the radical shift of the computer vision field away from hand-engineered image features and towards more automation by representation learning comes with many promises, including higher quality results and less engineering effort. In particular, convolutional neural networks learn features which take into account the context of the pixels and, therefore, a better representation of the data can be obtained. In this paper, we assess fully convolutional neural network architectures as replacements for a Random Forest classifier in an operational context for the production of high resolution land cover maps with Sentinel-2 time-series at the country scale. Our contributions include a framework for working with Sentinel-2 L2A time-series image data, an adaptation of the U-Net model (a fully convolutional neural network) for dealing with sparse annotation data while maintaining high resolution output, and an analysis of those results in the context of operational production of land cover maps. We conclude that fully convolutional neural networks can yield improved results with respect to pixel-wise Random Forest classifiers for classes where texture and context are pertinent. However, this new approach shows higher variability in quality across different landscapes and comes with a computational cost which could be to high for operational systems.",2019,124,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3fac59f31d0071de3ff778fc28859d80fe8b0e96,3fac59f31d0071de3ff778fc28859d80fe8b0e96,"A.

"A Multisensor Approach to Satellite Monitoring of Trends in Lake Area, Water Level, and Volume","Lakes in arid regions play an important role in regional water cycles and are a vital economic resource, but can fluctuate widely in area and volume. This study demonstrates the use of a multisensor satellite remote sensing method for the comprehensive monitoring of lake surface areas, water levels, and volume for the Toshka Lakes in southern Egypt, from lake formation in 1998 to mid-2017. Two spectral water indices were used to construct a daily time-series of surface area from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), validated by higher-resolution Landsat images. Water levels were obtained from analysis of digital elevation models from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), validated with ICESat Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) laser altimetry. Total lake volume peaked at 26.54 × 109 m3 in December 2001, and declined to 0.76 × 109 m3 by August 2017. Evaporation accounted for approximately 86% of the loss, and groundwater recharge accounted for 14%. Without additional inflows, the last remaining lake will likely disappear between 2020 and 2022. The Enhanced Lake Index, a water index equivalent to the Enhanced Vegetation Index, was found to have lower noise levels than the Normalized Difference Lake Index. The results show that multi-platform satellite remote sensing provides an efficient method for monitoring the hydrology of lakes.",2019,32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a7411e1f37483a98994cf013d140b3ef81f0a2eb,a7411e1f37483a98994cf013d140b3ef81f0a2eb,J.

Technical Framework for Shallow-Water Bathymetry With High Reliability and No Missing Data Based on Time-Series Sentinel-2 Images,"Shallow-water bathymetry based on multispectral satellite imagery (MSI) is an important technology for depth measurement, but it is difficult to obtain a bathymetric map with high reliability and no missing data because of the ubiquitous image noise. Here, we propose a time-series-based bathymetry framework (TSBF). First, a pixel-level time series is constructed using remote sensing images collected at multiple points in time. Then, a new time-domain denoising method, the maximum outlier removal method, is used to create an optimal image from this time series. Finally, bathymetric inversion is performed using this optimal image to obtain a bathymetric map. Anda Reef and northeastern Jiuzhang Atoll, which have complex noise features, were selected as test cases to validate the proposed framework. Results show that the proposed TSBF can obtain bathymetric maps with high accuracy, reliability, and no missing data, outperforming the conventional bathymetry framework based on a single image.",2019,18,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0c126dc04b37833df21b88972be70fb3f17d08c,f0c126dc04b37833df21b88972be70fb3f17d08c,"Sensen Chu, Liang Cheng, Xiaoguang Ruan, Qizhi Zhuang, Xiao Zhou, Manchun Li, Yongzhong Shi"
Time series of flood mapping in the Mekong Delta using high resolution satellite images,"The Mekong Delta, located in Southern Vietnam, is one of the most affected areas in the world by climate change and sea level rises, especially flooding. Therefore, flood mapping is essential for understanding the flood regime and mitigating its impacts. Remote sensing and GIS can support the accurate and area wide evaluation of floods. In this study, high spatial resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data were used to generate a dense satellite data time series for analysing the spatio-temporal patterns of flooding in the Mekong Delta. To derive water masks, a total of 777 Sentinel-1, 515 Sentinel-2 and 57 Landsat-8 scenes were used to generate cloud free water masks at a 10m spatial resolution in regular 10-day intervals throughout the observation period of hydrological years 2016-2017. The results show a spatial explicit information on the core zones of the seasonal flooding processes for the entire Mekong Delta and their effect of using floodwater for rice cultivation.

Application of active contours in feature extraction in LANDSAT 8 and CBERS 4 images,"Digital images from orbital platforms are the main source of information for mapping and decision-making. Their use has become increasingly popular over the years and has expanded into various areas. Feature extraction in digital images has been widely researched in Image Analysis, Photogrammetry, and Computer Vision. Works related to feature extraction for the generation and updating of GISs are generally divided into anthropic features such as buildings and/or highways and natural features such as vegetation areas or bodies of water. One attractive methodology for feature extraction, especially for rivers and bodies of water, is based on active contours, formulated based on the evolution of curves, which can have parametric models (Snakes) or geometric models (Level set). In this context, this work intends to identify and compare some characteristics of parametric and geometric active contour methods and apply them to orbital images from the OLI and PAN sensors of the LANDSAT 8 and CBERS 4 satellites for feature extraction, correlating these characteristics with the parameters required in the mathematical models of active contours. The present work makes use of Digital Image Processing (DIP) methods, with the first processing stage known as pre-processing, consisting of interconnected tasks that can be used to extract some information about the objects present in the scene. Subsequently, in the processing stage, the features of interest are extracted with the help of the Fiji and Icy software using Level Set and Snake, respectively. Regardless of the method used, the results presented in this work show an extraction time compatible with application needs, as they are developed semi-automatically.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f2db35c3688b4fbaaa2dda8994e63989b55f15c,2f2db35c3688b4fbaaa2dda8994e63989b55f15c,"Cleberton Reiz, Jordan Luiz Dourado Filgueiras, Jader Willian Evaristo, R.

Application of ensemble Kalman filter in WRF model to forecast rainfall on monsoon onset period in South Vietnam,"This paper presents some results of rainfall forecast in the monsoon onset period in South Vietnam, with the use of ensemble Kalman filter to assimilate observation data into the initial field of the model. The study of rainfall forecasts are experimented at the time of Southern monsoon outbreaks for 3 years (2005, 2008 and 2009), corresponding to 18 cases. In each case, there are five trials, including satellite wind data assimilation, upper-air sounding data assimilation, mixed data (satellite wind+upper-air sounding data) assimilation and two controlled trials (one single predictive test and one multi-physical ensemble prediction), which is equivalent to 85 forecasts for one trial. Based on the statistical evaluation of 36 samples (18 meteorological stations and 18 trials), the results show that Kalman filter assimilates satellite wind data to forecast well rainfall at 48 hours and 72 hours ranges. With 24 hour forecasting period, upper-air sounding data assimilation and mixed data assimilation experiments predicted better rainfall than non-assimilation tests. The results of the assessment based on the phase prediction indicators also show that the ensemble Kalman filter assimilating satellite wind data and mixed data sets improve the rain forecasting capability of the model at 48 hours and 72 hour ranges, while the upper-air sounding data assimilation test produces satisfactory results at the 72 hour forecast range, and the multi-physical ensemble test predicted good rainfall at 24 hour and 48 hour forecasts. The results of this research initially lead to a new research approach, Kalman Filter Application that assimilates the existing observation data into input data of the model that can improve the quality of rainfall forecast in Southern Vietnam and overall country in general.References Bui Minh Tuan, Nguyen Minh Truong, 2013.

USE OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES IN DECISION OF GEOINFORMATIONAL TASKS,"Computer vision and data analysis are one of the most popular topics both among information technologies and most areas of scientific research. Geography, cartography and geoinformatics with their variety of types of source data, spatial analysis problems, visualization methods, modeling and forecasting methods cannot be better suited for using modern algorithms of machine learning. However, the use of these technologies rarely goes beyond the solution of private tasks of commercial campaigns and, often, is not widely publicized and any systematization or scientific description. In this respect, we decided to make a research of machine learning technologies in the context of using it while solving the most typical problems of geographical research. The classification of problems, algorithms and methods of computer vision from the point of view of geoinformation systems is given. Possible ways of solving some problems of classification and segmentation of raster images are described. The most popular of them are analyzed, including such as the use of convolutional and pre-conditioned neural networks for the recognition of objects on satellite images. The approbation took place within the competition in vectorization of hydrographic objects and the classification of objects in the open sea Statoil / C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge. As initial data, we took marked satellite images of the water surface. The ways of spatial data analysis using the Moran index and calculating the Gini coefficient are considered. The methods of predicting the location of the coordinates of the house and work sudden user using the time series of ATM and cash register transactions at service points using regression algorithms were investigated. To conduct this study, the data set of the AllRussian competition in machine learning Raiffeisen Data Cup was used. We compared the results of usage of the machine learning algorithms and traditional methods of spatial analysis. Based on the results of the fulfilled investigations, we made the conclusions about the usability of the algorithms and technologies for specific geographic tasks, taking into account the dependence of the results from the types of using data used, resources requirements, accuracy, and universality.",2018,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/91b1ecfaed805d1c919e777ad01e08b965888c07,91b1ecfaed805d1c919e777ad01e08b965888c07,"Alexey Kolesniko, P.

Climatology of Tropical Cyclone Rainfall Magnitude at Different Landfalling Stages: An Emphasis on After-Landfall Rain,"
Estimating the magnitude of tropical cyclone (TC) rainfall at different landfalling stages is an important aspect of the TC forecast that directly affects the level of response from emergency managers. In this study, a climatology of the TC rainfall magnitude as a function of the location of the TC centers within distance intervals from the coast and the percentage of the raining area over the land is presented on a global scale. A total of 1834 TCs in the period from 2000 until 2019 are analyzed using satellite information to characterize the precipitation magnitude, volumetric rain, rainfall area, and axial-symmetric properties within the proposed landfalling categories, with an emphasis on the postlandfall stages. We found that TCs experience rainfall maxima in regions adjacent to the coast when more than 50% of their rainfall area is over the water. TC rainfall is also analyzed over the entire TC extent and the portion over land. When the total extent is considered, rainfall intensity, volumetric rain, and rainfall area increase with wind speed intensity. However, once it is quantified over the land only, we found that rainfall intensity exhibits a nearly perfect inversely proportional relation with the increase in TC rainfall area. In addition, when a TC with life maximum intensity of a major hurricane makes landfall as a tropical depression or tropical storm, it usually produces the largest spatial extent and the highest volumetric rain.


This study aims to describe the cycle of tropical cyclone (TC) precipitation magnitude through a new approach that defines the landfall categories as a function of the percentage of the TC precipitating area over the land and ocean, along with the location of the TC centers within distance intervals from the coast. Our central hypothesis is that TC rainfall should exhibit distinct features in the long-term satellite time series for each of the proposed stages. We particularly focused on the overland events due to their effects on human activities, finding that the TCs that at some point of their life cycle reached major hurricane strength and made landfall as a tropical storm or tropical depression produced the highest volumetric rain over the land surface. This research also presents key observational evidence of the relationship between the rain rate, raining area, and volumetric rain for landfalling TCs.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c32d7d1ba072e5eac04245051bcd50c6685630d7,c32d7d1ba072e5eac04245051bcd50c6685630d7,"Oscar Guzman, Haiyan Jiang"
A Novel Approach to Estimating Time-Averaged Volcanic SO2 Fluxes from Infrared Satellite Measurements,"Long-term continuous time series of SO2 emissions are considered critical elements of both volcano monitoring and basic research into processes within magmatic systems. One highly successful framework for computing these fluxes involves reconstructing a representative time-averaged SO2 plume from which to estimate the SO2 source flux. Previous methods within this framework have used ancillary wind datasets from reanalysis or numerical weather prediction (NWP) to construct the mean plume and then again as a constrained parameter in the fitting. Additionally, traditional SO2 datasets from ultraviolet (UV) sensors lack altitude information, which must be assumed, to correctly calibrate the SO2 data and to capture the appropriate NWP wind level which can be a significant source of error. We have made novel modifications to this framework which do not rely on prior knowledge of the winds and therefore do not inherit errors associated with NWP winds. To perform the plume rotation, we modify a rudimentary computer vision algorithm designed for object detection in medical imaging to detect plume-like objects in gridded SO2 data. We then fit a solution to the general time-averaged dispersion of SO2 from a point source. We demonstrate these techniques using SO2 data generated by a newly developed probabilistic layer height and column loading algorithm designed for the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), a hyperspectral infrared sensor aboard the Joint Polar Satellite System’s Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20 satellites. This SO2 data source is best suited to flux estimates at high-latitude volcanoes and at low-latitude, but high-altitude volcanoes. Of particular importance, IR SO2 data can fill an important data gap in the UV-based record: estimating SO2 emissions from high-latitude volcanoes through the polar winters when there is insufficient solar backscatter for UV sensors to be used.",2021,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/128082bab02a44915b70c9d12749e29ef02a3712,128082bab02a44915b70c9d12749e29ef02a3712,"D.

Damaged Building Detection from Satellite Multispectral Imagery,"Damaged Building footprint detection in satellite and aerial imagery is crucial in city management. Building detection is a fundamental but a challenging problem mainly because it requires correct recovery of building footprints from high-resolution images. Buildings are one of the key pieces of cadastral information related to population and cities, and are fundamental to urban planning & policymaking. Critical infrastructures, such as public transport, electricity, water distribution networks, or postal and delivery services, rely heavily on accurate population and building maps. On top of that, it is essential to get real-life, up-to-date information about buildings each time there is a need for disaster risk management, risk assessment, or emergency relief. Accurate and fine-grained information about the extent of damage to buildings is essential for directing Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Response operations in the immediate aftermath of any natural calamity. Satellite and UAV (drone) imagery has been used for this purpose in recent years, sometimes aided by computer vision algorithms. Existing Computer Vision approaches for building damage assessment typically rely on a two stage approach, consisting of building detection using an object detection model, followed by damage assessment through classification of the detected building tiles. These multi-stage methods are not end-to-end trainable, and as well as suffer from poor overall results. We proposed the UNet segmentation model, a model that can simultaneously segment buildings and assess the damage levels to individual buildings and can be trained end-to-end. We trained the model using X View 2 challenge dataset.",2021,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01f32766cc799b68a1f945c874f6bb570b69de37,01f32766cc799b68a1f945c874f6bb570b69de37,A. Sangeetha
Can GNSS-R Detect Abrupt Water Level Changes?,"Global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) uses signals of opportunity in a bi-static configuration of L-band microwave radar to retrieve environmental variables such as water level. The line-of-sight signal and its coherent surface reflection signal are not separate observables in geodetic GNSS-R. The temporally constructive and destructive oscillations in the recorded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observations can be used to retrieve water-surface levels at intermediate spatial scales that are proportional to the height of the GNSS antenna above the water surface. In this contribution, SNR observations are used to retrieve water levels at the Vianden Pumped Storage Plant (VPSP) in Luxembourg, where the water-surface level abruptly changes up to 17 m every 4-8 h to generate a peak current when the energy demand increases. The GNSS-R water level retrievals are corrected for the vertical velocity and acceleration of the water surface. The vertical velocity and acceleration corrections are important corrections that mitigate systematic errors in the estimated water level, especially for VPSP with such large water-surface changes. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the 10-min multi-GNSS water level time series and water level gauge records is 7.0 cm for a one-year period, with a 0.999 correlation coefficient. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-R can be used as a new complementary approach to study hurricanes or storm surges that cause abnormal rises of water levels.",2020,10,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/68c56c4f5311411df786b30eeee6b0000b53f78f,68c56c4f5311411df786b30eeee6b0000b53f78f,"S.

Quantifying the Effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria on Coastal Water Quality in Puerto Rico using Moderate Resolution Satellite Sensors,"Coastal, benthic communities, such as coral reefs, are at particular risk due to poor water quality caused by hurricanes. In addition to the physical impacts from wave action and storm surge, hurricanes bring significant rainfall resulting in increased runoff from land. Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused record or near-record floods at many locations across Puerto Rico and resulted in major impacts on coastal and benthic ecosystems from heavy rainfall and river discharge. In this study, we use imagery from the moderate resolution Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite to quantify the impacts of hurricanes Irma and Maria, which struck Puerto Rico during September 2017, on the water quality of the coastal waters of Puerto Rico using the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (Kd490) products. The objectives include: (1) quantify the water quality and light attenuation after the hurricanes; (2) compare this event to the climatology of these parameters, and 3) evaluate long-term exposure and exceedances of various coastal areas to low levels of turbidity. The Chl-a inner shelf values increased in 2017 during the months of June (8% above baseline), July (17%), August (5%), September (8%), October (19%), and November (28%) when compared to 2012–2016 baseline data. The values for Chl-a concentration reached and exceeded 0.45 µg/L by August 2017 and persisted above that value until December 2017. The Kd490 inner shelf values for 2017 increased (in percent) for the months of June (4% above baseline), July (9%), August (10%), September (5%), October (12%), and November (7%) when compared to 2012–2016 baseline data. The values of Kd490 in August, September, and December 2017 were the highest seen during 2012–2017. Even with the limitations of spatial resolution and loss of data to cloud cover, the 6-year imagery time-series analysis can provide a useful evaluation of the effects of these two hurricanes on the coastal water quality in Puerto Rico, and quantify the exposure of benthic habitats to higher nutrient and turbidity levels.",2020,14,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b3b48e8104824cc6800a9f5345240bb1a47aa60,8b3b48e8104824cc6800a9f5345240bb1a47aa60,"William J.

"Advances in Remote Sensing Technology, Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Marine Oil Spill Detection, Prediction and Vulnerability Assessment","Although advancements in remote sensing technology have facilitated quick capture and identification of the source and location of oil spills in water bodies, the presence of other biogenic elements (lookalikes) with similar visual attributes hinder rapid detection and prompt decision making for emergency response. To date, different methods have been applied to distinguish oil spills from lookalikes with limited success. In addition, accurately modeling the trajectory of oil spills remains a challenge. Thus, we aim to provide further insights on the multi-faceted problem by undertaking a holistic review of past and current approaches to marine oil spill disaster reduction as well as explore the potentials of emerging digital trends in minimizing oil spill hazards. The scope of previous reviews is extended by covering the inter-related dimensions of detection, discrimination, and trajectory prediction of oil spills for vulnerability assessment. Findings show that both optical and microwave airborne and satellite remote sensors are used for oil spill monitoring with microwave sensors being more widely used due to their ability to operate under any weather condition. However, the accuracy of both sensors is affected by the presence of biogenic elements, leading to false positive depiction of oil spills. Statistical image segmentation has been widely used to discriminate lookalikes from oil spills with varying levels of accuracy but the emergence of digitalization technologies in the fourth industrial revolution (IR 4.0) is enabling the use of Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, which are more promising than the statistical methods. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are the most used machine learning algorithms for oil spill detection, although the restriction of ML models to feed forward image classification without support for the end-to-end trainable framework limits its accuracy. On the other hand, deep learning models’ strong feature extraction and autonomous learning capability enhance their detection accuracy. Also, mathematical models based on lagrangian method have improved oil spill trajectory prediction with higher real time accuracy than the conventional worst case, average and survey-based approaches. However, these newer models are unable to quantify oil droplets and uncertainty in vulnerability prediction. Considering that there is yet no single best remote sensing technique for unambiguous detection and discrimination of oil spills and lookalikes, it is imperative to advance research in the field in order to improve existing technology and develop specialized sensors for accurate oil spill detection and enhanced classification, leveraging emerging geospatial computer vision initiatives.",2020,60,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9bea5ff9c6ce0ebde1d6f35c6e9bf8beeb5e7722,9bea5ff9c6ce0ebde1d6f35c6e9bf8beeb5e7722,"S.

Close-range sensing and object-based analysis of shallow landslides and erosion in grasslands,"
 <p>Close-range sensing methods for topographic data acquisition, such as Structure-from-Motion with multi-view stereo (SfM-MVS) photogrammetry and laser scanning from the ground or from unmanned aerial systems (UAS), have strongly improved over the last decade. As they are providing data with sub-decimetre resolution and accuracy, these methods open new possibilities for bridging the gap between local in-situ observations and area-wide space-borne or aerial remote sensing. For assessments of shallow landslides and erosion patches, which are wide-spread phenomena in mountain grasslands, the potential of close-range sensing is two-fold: Firstly, it could provide accurate reference data for assessing the geometric accuracy of a catchment or regional scale eroded area monitoring based on aerial or satellite remote sensing systems. Secondly, selected sites can be monitored at a very detailed local scale to reveal processes of secondary erosion or natural vegetation succession and slope stabilisation. Furthermore, high-resolution 4D data from multi-temporal close-range sensing make it possible to quantify volumes and rates of displacement at erosion features. In this contribution, we propose to exploit this potential of close-range sensing for landslide and erosion studies with object-based approaches for raster and 3D point cloud analyses. Assuming that erosion features can be discriminated from undisturbed grassland and from trees and shrubs, based on their morphometric and spectral signatures, we show how computer vision and machine learning techniques help to detect and label these features automatically as spatial objects in the data. We combine this object detection and labelling with 2.5D differential elevation models and with 3D deformation analysis of point clouds. This strategy addresses one of the key challenges of automatically analysing close-range sensing data in geomorphological studies, i.e. linking geometric information (such as the size and shape of erosion features or the surface change across a time series) with semantic information (e.g. separating vegetation from complex ground structures). In three case studies from recent projects in the Alps, where we acquired data by UAS, terrestrial laser scanning and terrestrial photogrammetry, we demonstrate the use of these new methodological developments. The methods tested can reliably detect changes with minimum magnitudes of centimetre to decimetre level, depending primarily on the specific data acquisition setup. By automatically relating these changes to erosion features of different scales (i.e. both at entire eroded areas and at their components, e.g. collapsing parts of the scarp), such analyses can provide valuable insights regarding process dynamics. In our tests, close-range sensing and automated data analysis workflows helped to understand both the development of new eroded areas as well as their enlargement by secondary erosion processes or episodic landslide reactivation. Based on the experience from these case studies, we also discuss the main challenges and limitations of these methods for erosion monitoring applications.</p>

"Spatial Altimetry, GNSS Reflectometry and Marine Surcotes","The objective of this PhD thesis was to develop an innovative remote sensing methodology, based on existing platforms, to monitor the main factors influencing coastal dynamics. We propose monitoring based on a classic tool i.e. satellite altimetry but with a focus on new space missions (SARAL, Sentinel-3). Whose contributions will be evaluated, particularly in the coastal zone, which is the most critical from a socio-economic point of view? I have focused my attention on the French Atlantic coast between La Rochelle and Bayonne. We will also rely on an original technique based on the reflection of GNSS positioning satellites (technical known as GNSS-R). These tools will allow us to precisely monitor the various tidal waves, but they have also allowed us to detect more unusual phenomena such as the extreme event of 2010: the storm Xynthia that affected the coasts of southern Europe. These tools demonstrate that it is also possible will also be able to see to monitor the coastal dynamics related to swell variations and its impact on coastal erosion, and even the effects of the strong atmospheric depression associated with Xynthia, which has had a measurable impact on the local sea level of the Atlantic Ocean. My thesis is focused on two complementary approaches based on two scales of study: the first one is global and used satellite altimetry, the second one is more local and focused on the extreme event detection and it is based on the GNSS reflectometry. 
The first study, which I carried out, relies on different satellite altimetry missions (ERS-2, Jason- 1/2/3, ENVISAT, SARAL) which allowed us to follow the sea level variations (SSH) from the French Atlantic coast to the south of the Bay of Biscay during the 1995-2015 period. SARAL data, including a footprint of around 6 km, show that it is now possible to approach the coastal fringe up to ~ 10 km with a great precision (RMSE ~ 20 cm). The second application is based on the GNSS-R methodology that we used to track SSH in the inner part of the bay of Saint Jean de Luz – Socoa during the storm Xynthia. Here again the results are exceptional since they allowed us to follow the impact of the storm Xynthia on the local level of the ocean. I thus highlighted that it was possible with only one instrument to follow the effects of the tides, and even the effects of the marine surges which associated to the impact of the atmospheric pressure on the sea level give a good correlation (R = 0.77 between the RC3 component and the surge, and R = 0.73 with the atmospheric pressure) during storm. Finally we also looked at what is happening in the transition between continental and oceanic waters for the deltas of the Red River and Mekong in Vietnam. And, even if the time series are rather short or truncated (Red River) the results are more than encouraging since they allowed us to follow the flooding events associated with two tropical storms (Mirinae and Nida) and to measure the delay between the rain falls and the propagation of the flood wave which shows in this case a delay of 48 h for Nida. 
With the deployment of permanent GNSS networks in many countries, this technique can be applied when a permanent GNSS station is located near the shore. The GNSS-R approach can be used to monitor sea level variations but also the effect of extreme events. For that we used 3 months of recordings (January-March 2010) from the Socoa GNSS station to determine the tidal components in the GNSS-R signals and to identify the Xynthia storm. This study is the first example of the use of GNSS-R to detect overcoats and storms using signal decomposition techniques in the form of singular spectral analysis (SSA) and continuous wavelet transformation. One of the modes of decomposition of the SSA was related to temporal variations in surcharges and atmospheric fluctuations across the inverted barometer. 
My work shows that new altimetry mission and GNSS-R are a powerful alternative and a significant complement technique for managing water resource and monitoring SLR near the coastal area. The GNSS-R technique have also a great advantage based on an already developed and sustainable GNSS satellite networks which has recorded continuous and large time series shall exceed 15 years. These quite long time series are necessary to have a good estimation of the effects of the global warming on the sea level height.",2019,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96f79f4cff264419d28fe7bd805437f3c32ba3af,96f79f4cff264419d28fe7bd805437f3c32ba3af,P.

Analyzing the Impacts of Climate Change on Water Level Fluctuations of Tashk and Bakhtegan Lakes and Its Role in Environmental Sustainability,"Climate changes are the main motivation for destruction of ecosystems; in fact the effects of these changes on biodiversity and ecosystems are considered as the most challenging cases in present century. Therefore, since the lakes are the most important services and functions of ecosystems, the effect of climate change on water level fluctuations of Tashk and Bakhtegan Lakes was analyzed as a natural ecosystem in this essay. For this purpose, the data related to six parameters of temperature, precipitation, evaporation, sunshine hours and snowy days were selected during 25-year statistical period (1985-2010), and Mann-Kendall test was used to determine the trend of changes in each time series. Inflow system of the lake, the volume of evaporation and area of water were simulated and fluctuation of lake was also assessed by using dynamic analysis method and to achieve to lake level and analysis of its fluctuations in period under study, the satellite images of Landsat 7 and ETM 5-1 were used in two high waters of April 1987 and April 2010. Results indicate that the lake level has been dropped 6 meters in 2010 compared to the similar period of 1986; in wet years that the rainfall is more than 618/5 mm, high water level is the lake conditions in all months of the year; unlike in most years when rainfall occurred under average of 365.4 mm, lake is faced with dry condition that is mainly due to the reduce of icemaker area, rainfall reduction, increase in evaporation and temperature. These conditions show the extent to which the lake is fragile and affected by climatic conditions that the most obvious evidence of it is decline of genetic storages such as Tashk and Bakhtegan lakes and subsequently instability of the region and reducing of services and ecosystems’ functions.",2017,14,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3c718ec1ca3324e60685b80af54d65e8b2e1ffa8,3c718ec1ca3324e60685b80af54d65e8b2e1ffa8,"T.

Estimating Vertical Land Motion in Northern Adriatic Sea with Coastal Altimetry and In Situ Observations,"
 <p align=""justify""><span>The European Space Agency, in the framework of the Sea Level Climate Change Initiative (SL_CCI), is developing consistent and long-term satellite-based data-sets to study climate-scale variations of sea level globally and in the coastal zone. Two altimetry data-sets were recently produced. The first product is generated over a grid of 0.25x0.25 degrees, merging and homogenizing the various satellite altimetry missions. The second product that is still experimental is along track over a grid of 0.35 km. An operational production of climate-oriented altimeter sea level products has just started in the framework of the European Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and a daily-mean product is now available over a grid of 0.125x0.125 degrees covering the global ocean since 1993 to present.</span></p><p align=""justify""><span>We made a comparison of the SL_CCI satellite altimetry dataset with sea level time series at selected tide gauges in the Mediterranean Sea, focusing on Venice and Trieste. There, the coast is densely covered by civil settlements and industrial areas with a strongly rooted seaside tourism, and tides and storm-related surges reach higher levels than in most of the Mediterranean Sea, causing damages and casualties as in the recent storm of November 12th, 2019: the second higher water registered in Venice since 1872. Moreover, in the Venice area the ground displacements exhibit clear negative trends which deepen the effects of the absolute sea level rise.</span></p><p align=""justify""><span>Several authors have pointed out the synergy between satellite altimetry and tide gauges to corroborate evidences of ground displacements. Our contribution aims at understanding the role played by subsidence, estimated by the diffence between coastal altimetry and in situ measurements, on the local sea level rise. A partial validation of these estimates has been made against GPS-derived values, in order to distinguish the contributions of subsidence and eustatism. This work will contribute to identify problems and challenges to extend the sea level climate record to the coastal zone with quality comparable to the open ocean, and also to assess the suitability of altimeter-derived absolute sea levels as a tool to estimate subsidence from tide gauge measurement in places where permanent GPS receivers are not available.</span></p>

A Fused Radar-Optical Approach for Mapping Wetlands and Deepwaters of the Mid-Atlantic and Gulf Coast Regions of the United States,"Tidal wetlands are critically important ecosystems that provide ecosystem services including carbon sequestration, storm surge mitigation, water filtration, and wildlife habitat provision while supporting high levels of biodiversity. Despite their importance, monitoring these systems over large scales remains challenging due to difficulties in obtaining extensive up-to-date ground surveys and the need for high spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery for effective space-borne monitoring. In this study, we developed methodologies to advance the monitoring of tidal marshes and adjacent deepwaters in the Mid-Atlantic and Gulf Coast United States. We combined Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat 8 optical imagery to classify marshes and open water in both regions, with user’s and producer’s accuracies exceeding 89%. This methodology enables the assessment of marsh loss through conversion to open water at an annual resolution. We used time-series Sentinel-1 imagery to classify persistent and non-persistent marsh vegetation with greater than 93% accuracy. Non-persistent marsh vegetation serves as an indicator of salinity regimes in tidal wetlands. Additionally, we mapped two invasive species: wetlands invasive Phragmites australis (common reed) with greater than 80% accuracy and deepwater invasive Trapa natans (water chestnut) with greater than 96% accuracy. These results have important implications for improved monitoring and management of coastal wetlands ecosystems.",2021,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3d614c3a96d46c0179154064f57b26c7d56eee9,d3d614c3a96d46c0179154064f57b26c7d56eee9,"B.
