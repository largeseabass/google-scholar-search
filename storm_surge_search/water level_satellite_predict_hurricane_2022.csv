Hourly Water Level Forecasting in an Hydroelectric Basin Using Spatial Interpolation and Artificial Intelligence,"In this work, a new hydroelectric basin modelling approach is described and applied to the Pontecosi basin, Italy. Several types of data sources were used to learn the model: a number of weather stations, satellite observations, the reanalysis dataset, and basin data. With the goal of predicting the water level of the basin, the model was composed by three cascade modules. Firstly, different spatial interpolation methods, such as Kriging, Radial Basis Function, and Natural Neighbours, were compared and applied to interpolate the weather stations data nearby the basin area to infer the main environmental variables (air temperature, air humidity, precipitation, and wind speed) in the basin area. Then, using these variables as inputs, a neural network was trained to predict the mean soil moisture concentration over the area, also to improve the low availability due to satellite orbits. Finally, a non-linear auto regressive exogenous input (NARX) model was trained to simulate the basin level with different prediction horizons, using the data from the previous modules and past basin data (water level, discharge flow rate, and turbine flow rate). Accurate predictions of the basin water level were achieved within 1 to 6 h ahead, with mean absolute errors (MAE) between 2 cm and 10 cm, respectively.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/322be6ca7d046407668a19252197f39f3cdf039f,322be6ca7d046407668a19252197f39f3cdf039f,M.

Monitoring and Analysis of Water Level–Water Storage Capacity Changes in Ngoring Lake Based on Multisource Remote Sensing Data,"Mastering the fluctuation of water levels and the water storage capacity of plateau lakes is greatly important for monitoring the water balance of the Tibetan Plateau and predicting regional and global climate change. The water level of plateau lakes is difficult to measure, and the ground measured data of long-time series are difficult to obtain. Ngoring Lake is considered in this study, using spaceborne single-photon lidar ICESat-2/ATL13 inland lake standard data products, the water level values provided by Hydroweb laboratory, and the image data of an optical remote sensing satellite. A new method is proposed in the absence of measured data. The method uses multisource remote sensing data to estimate the long-term changes in the water levels, surface area, and water storage capacity of Ngoring Lake in the past three decades. The results show that the water level values of ICESat-2 and Hydroweb on overlapping observation days are highly correlated, with R2 = 0.9776, MAE = 0.420 m, RMSE = 0.077 m, and the average absolute height difference is 0.049 m. The fusion of multiple altimetry data can obtain more continuous long-time series water-level observation results. From 1992 to 2021, the water body information of Ngoring Lake basin fluctuated greatly and showed different variation characteristics in different time periods. The lowest water level in January 1997 was approximately 4268.49 m, and it rose to its highest in October 2009, approximately 4272.44 m. The change in the water level in the basin was mainly affected by natural factors, such as precipitation, air temperature, and human activities. The analysis shows that ICESat-2 can be combined with other remote sensing data to realize the long-time series dynamic monitoring of plateau lakes, showing great advantages in the comprehensive observation of plateau lakes in no man’s land.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8840ce4b1a2be14baa3f07377463629d1c2f0a2d,8840ce4b1a2be14baa3f07377463629d1c2f0a2d,"W.

Understanding Water Level Changes in the Great Lakes by an ICA-Based Merging of Multi-Mission Altimetry Measurements,"Accurately monitoring spatio-temporal changes in lake water levels is important for studying the impacts of climate change on freshwater resources, and for predicting natural hazards. In this study, we applied multi-mission radar satellite altimetry data from the Laurentian Great Lakes, North America to optimally reconstruct multi-decadal lake-wide spatio-temporal changes of water level. We used the results to study physical processes such as teleconnections of El Niño and southern oscillation (ENSO) episodes over approximately the past three-and-a-half decades (1985–2018). First, we assessed three reconstruction methods, namely the standard empirical orthogonal function (EOF), complex EOF (CEOF), and complex independent component analysis (CICA), to model the lake-wide changes of water level. The performance of these techniques was evaluated using in-situ gauge data, after correcting the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) process using a contemporary GIA forward model. While altimeter-measured water level was much less affected by GIA, the averaged gauge-measured water level was found to have increased up to 14 cm over the three decades. Our results indicate that the CICA-reconstructed 35-year lake level was more accurate than the other two techniques. The correlation coefficients between the CICA reconstruction and the in situ water-level data were 0.96, 0.99, 0.97, 0.97, and 0.95, for Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario, respectively; ~7% higher than the original altimetry data. The root mean squares of errors (RMSE) were 6.07 cm, 4.89 cm, 9.27 cm, 7.71 cm, and 9.88 cm, respectively, for each of the lakes, and ~44% less than differencing with the original altimetry data. Furthermore, the CICA results indicated that the water-level changes in the Great Lakes were significantly correlated with ENSO, with correlation coefficients of 0.5–0.8. The lake levels were ~25 cm higher (~30 cm lower) than normal during EI Niño (La Niña) events.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/47c8ddc614fcb4ed43539617abd237f6419d1fc2,47c8ddc614fcb4ed43539617abd237f6419d1fc2,"Wei Chen, C.

Disaster assessment using computer vision and satellite imagery: Applications in detecting water-related building damages,"The increasing frequency and severity of water-related disasters such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, and tsunamis in low- and middle-income countries exemplify the uneven effects of global climate change. The vulnerability of high-risk societies to natural disasters has continued to increase. To develop an effective and efficient adaptation strategy, local damage assessments must be timely, exhaustive, and accurate. We propose a novel deep-learning-based solution that uses pairs of pre- and post-disaster satellite images to identify water-related disaster-affected regions. The model extracts features of pre- and post-disaster images and uses the feature difference with them to predict damage in the pair. We demonstrate that the model can successfully identify local destruction using less granular and less complex ground-truth data than those used by previous segmentation models. When tested with various water-related disasters, our detection model reported an accuracy of 85.9% in spotting areas with damaged buildings. It also achieved a reliable performance of 80.3% in out-of-domain settings. Our deep learning-based damage assessment model can help direct resources to areas most vulnerable to climate disasters, reducing their impacts while promoting adaptive capacities for climate-resilient development in the most vulnerable regions.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30eb0b260032aaec8d8a00c8abd20da6369e4987,30eb0b260032aaec8d8a00c8abd20da6369e4987,"Danu Kim, Jeongkyung Won, Eunji Lee, K.

Improving Tropical Cyclogenesis Forecasts of Hurricane Irma (2017) through the Assimilation of All-Sky Infrared Brightness Temperatures,"
The assimilation of satellite all-sky infrared (IR) brightness temperatures (BTs) has been shown in previous studies to improve intensity forecasts of tropical cyclones. In this study, we examine whether assimilating all-sky IR BTs can also potentially improve tropical cyclogenesis forecasts by improving the pre-genesis cloud and moisture fields. By using an ensemble-based data assimilation system, we show that the assimilation of upper-tropospheric water vapor channel BTs observed by the Meteosat-10 SEVIRI instrument two days before the formation of a tropical depression improves the genesis forecast of Hurricane Irma (2017), a classic Cape Verde storm, by up to 24 hours while also capturing its later rapid intensification in deterministic forecasts. In an experiment that withholds the assimilation of all-sky IR BTs, the assimilation of conventional observations from the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) leads to the pre-mature genesis of Hurricane Irma by at least 24 hours. This pre-mature genesis is shown to result from an overestimation of the spatial coverage of deep convection within the African Easterly Wave (AEW) from which Irma eventually forms. The gross overestimation of deep convection without all-sky IR BTs is accompanied by higher column saturation fraction, stronger low-level convergence, and the earlier spin-up of a low-level meso-β-scale vortex within the AEW that ultimately becomes Hurricane Irma. Through its adjustment to the initial moisture and cloud conditions, the assimilation of all-sky IR BTs leads to a more realistic convective evolution in forecasts and ultimately a more realistic timing of genesis.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d5f1d00e0a62557a8bcec6b3b1eee7db3a7c784,7d5f1d00e0a62557a8bcec6b3b1eee7db3a7c784,"Christopher M.
