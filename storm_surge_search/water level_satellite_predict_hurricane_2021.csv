"Using Multisource Satellite Data to Investigate Lake Area, Water Level, and Water Storage Changes of Terminal Lakes in Ungauged Regions","Lake area, water level, and water storage changes of terminal lakes are vital for regional water resource management and for understanding local hydrological processes. Nevertheless, due to the complex geographical conditions, it is difficult to investigate and analyze this change in ungauged regions. This study focuses on the ungauged, semi-arid Gahai Lake, a typical small terminal lake in the Qaidam Basin. In addition to the scant observed data, satellite altimetry is scarce for the excessively large fraction of outlier points. Here, we proposed an effective and simple algorithm for extracting available lake elevation points from CryoSat-2, ICESat-2 and Sentinel-3. Combining with the area data from Landsat, Gaofen (GF), and Ziyuan (ZY) satellites, we built an optimal hypsographic curve (lake area versus water level) based on the existing short-term data. Cross-validation was used to validate whether the curve accurately could predict the lake water level in other periods. In addition, we used multisource high-resolution images including Landsat and digital maps to extract the area data from 1975 to 2020, and we applied the curve to estimate the water level for the corresponding period. Additionally, we adopted the pyramidal frustum model (PFM) and the integral model (IM) to estimate the long-term water storage changes, and analyzed the differences between these two models. We found that there has been an obvious change in the area, water level, and water storage since the beginning of the 21st century, which reflects the impact of climate change and human activities on hydrologic processes in the basin. Importantly, agricultural activities have caused a rapid increase in water storage in the Gahai Lake over the past decade. We collected as much multisource satellite data as possible; thus, we estimated the long-term variations in the area, water level, and water storage of a small terminal lake combining multiple models, which can provide an effective method to monitor lake changes in ungauged basins.",2021,9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e5dccb4ecfbed27ae749be01ff4b567dc70e5d83,e5dccb4ecfbed27ae749be01ff4b567dc70e5d83,"Chuanhui Zhang, A.

"Lake water level variability determination from SAR backscatter of discrete objects, GNSS levelling and satellite altimetry","In the absence of enough gauging stations for monitoring lake water level, three (3) methods are presented in this research: (1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter from discrete object; (2) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) levelling; and (3) satellite altimetry. The results showed that the Laguna Lake water level is not homogeneous but instead varies at different locations. The GNSS leveling showed that water level varies from −0.64 to 1.26 m from water gauge data. Using the fish pen guard house as discrete object for double bounce scattering a correlation of 0.86 was computed between the gauge data and sigma 0 the equation derived through linear regression was used to predict water level from SAR images at different periods. The satellite altimeter data correlated with water level from graduated staff at 0.97 with a difference of about 0.29 m. It also showed an increasing water level trend from north to south.",2021,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69cc339302f1820fa997f18d26209cdd995cabf0,69cc339302f1820fa997f18d26209cdd995cabf0,"R.

Sadewa satellite remote sensing data to Manggarai 1-hour water level machine learning model,"The Manggarai Water Gate is a measurement point strategically located to measure Jakarta's flooding magnitude that keeps increasing from year to year. The 2015s gate capacity improvement underscores this importance. This paper applies a machine learning model that utilizes an atmospheric approach to predict the Manggarai water level as output. In the process, optimization is done by comparing three spatial input sizes and performing a sensitivity analysis of the input variables. Using a simple recurrent sequence, the model can predict the water level with a coefficient of determination (${R}^{2}$) reaching 0.7 using 18-hour recurrent data. This study can be used as the basis for further development that can take satellite data lead time advantage that is crucial for the early warning system.",2021,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f3a6e668f3124ca845cc23034b61137d3cfdcea,3f3a6e668f3124ca845cc23034b61137d3cfdcea,"Jonathan Raditya Valerian, F.

Prediction Interval Identification Using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems: Lake Water Level Prediction Using Remote Sensing Data,"This paper presents a novel approach to identify the prediction interval associated with data using interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems with support vector regression. For such a purpose, a constrained quadratic objective function is defined which is then solved using well-established quadratic programming approaches. Not only does the output of interval type-2 fuzzy logic system replicates the measured value, but also it provides the lower bound and the upper bound for measured data values. In the proposed approach, to have more valuable information, a penalty term is added in the cost functions to have full control over the width of prediction interval. This method has been successfully applied to two benchmark identification problems. It is observed that by using the control parameter in the cost function, it is possible to obtain a narrower, yet inclusive prediction interval. Furthermore, superior prediction accuracy is obtained compared to existing methods in literature. Motivated by these results, the proposed approach is used to predict time series collected using a satellite from Urmia lake water level which resulted in high accuracy and an inclusive prediction interval. The graphical abstract presented for the paper illustrates the overall data gathering as well as data analysis made to estimate the prediction interval associated with Urmia lake water level data.",2021,8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b58d1cc3fdaa4ff09d3c7395641d652004da26c6,b58d1cc3fdaa4ff09d3c7395641d652004da26c6,"M.
