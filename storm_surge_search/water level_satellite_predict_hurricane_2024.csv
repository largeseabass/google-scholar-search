Using Inundation Extents to Predict Microbial Contamination in Private Wells after Flooding Events,"Disaster recovery poses unique challenges for residents reliant on private wells. Flooding events are drivers of microbial contamination in well water, but the relationship observed between flooding and contamination varies substantially. Here, we investigate the performance of different flood boundaries—the FEMA 100 year flood hazard boundary, height above nearest drainage-derived inundation extents, and satellite-derived extents from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory—in their ability to identify well water contamination following Hurricane Florence. Using these flood boundaries, we estimated about 2600 wells to 108,400 private wells may have been inundated—over 2 orders of magnitude difference based on boundary used. Using state-generated routine and post-Florence testing data, we observed that microbial contamination rates were 7.1–10.5 times higher within the three flood boundaries compared to routine conditions. However, the ability of the flood boundaries to identify contaminated samples varied spatially depending on the type of flooding (e.g., riverine, overbank, coastal). While participation in testing increased after Florence, rates were overall still low. With <1% of wells tested, there is a critical need for enhanced well water testing efforts. This work provides an understanding of the strengths and limitations of inundation mapping techniques, which are critical for guiding postdisaster well water response and recovery.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dfc927ae50df69e6c5d80ab498457fa976d5462f,dfc927ae50df69e6c5d80ab498457fa976d5462f,"Kyla R Drewry, C.

Vientos - A new satellite mission concept for 3D wind measurements by combining passive water vapor sounders with Doppler wind lidar,"
It is challenging to accurately characterize the three-dimensional distribution of horizontal wind vectors (known as 3D winds). Feature-matching satellite cloud top or water vapor fields have been used for decades to retrieve atmospheric motion vectors, but this approach is mostly limited to a single and uncertain pressure level at a given time. Satellite wind lidar measurements are expected to provide more accurate data and capture the line-of-sight wind for clear skies, within cirrus clouds, and above thick clouds, but only along a curtain parallel to the satellite track. Here we propose Vientos – a new satellite mission concept that combines 2 or more passive water vapor sounders with Doppler wind lidar to measure 3D winds. The need for 3D wind observations is highlighted by inconsistencies in reanalysis estimates, particularly under precipitating conditions. Recent studies have shown that 3D winds can be retrieved using water vapor observations from two polar-orbiting satellites separated by 50 minutes, with the help of advanced optical flow algorithms. These winds can be improved through the incorporation of a small number of co-located higher-accuracy measurements via machine learning. The Vientos concept would enable simultaneous measurements of 3D winds, temperature, and humidity, and is expected to have a significant impact on scientific research, weather prediction, and other applications. For example, it can help better understand and predict the preconditions for organized convection. This article summarizes recent results, presents the Vientos mission architecture, and discusses implementation scenarios for a 3D wind mission under current budget constraints.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/459dcb7e7b513c90d611660e540c8304107c3b66,459dcb7e7b513c90d611660e540c8304107c3b66,"Xubin Zeng, Hui Su, S.

Can Satellite‐Derived Beach Images Resolve the Responses to Human Activities?,"Satellite imagery is widely used to study beach changes. Studies based on satellite‐derived results predict that by 2100, half of the world’s beaches will disappear. Although previous studies have been productive and alarming, the reliability of these findings has not been validated. This study presents an initial comprehensive assessment of the reliability of satellite‐derived beach shoreline changes and concludes that despite the use of state‐of‐the‐art subpixel shoreline identification technologies and water‐level correction methods based on beach profile shapes, the errors in satellite‐derived shoreline positions remain significant. Thus, adequate satellite imagery is crucial for enhancing the reliability of satellite‐derived beach changes. Furthermore, the historical water levels when the Landsat and Sentinel‐2 images were taken exhibited significant systematic deviations and both long‐term and short‐term changes. Consequently, the beach changes obtained through the direct statistics obtained from satellite imagery based on big‐data platforms such as the Google Earth Engine (GEE) are susceptible to systematic biases. The study also concluded that satellite‐derived beach changes based on adequate satellite imagery have distinct, significant, and diverse responses to human activities. Given the current context of intensified human activities and notable inaccuracies in satellite‐derived shoreline positions, fully utilizing satellite imagery to study beach changes can help establish stronger connections between beach changes and human activities. This contributes to a better understanding of beach evolution mechanisms and the need for beach restoration and protection, with multiple scientific, engineering, and social implications.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a13d562633e27ff046dfd11a54eaa6aa767145e,2a13d562633e27ff046dfd11a54eaa6aa767145e,"Xiaodong Zhang, Chuan-long Wu, Rijun Hu, Shumei Xu, Zhanrui Xu, Zuosheng Yang"
A New Remote Sensing Index for Forest Dryness Monitoring Using Multi-Spectral Satellite Imagery,"Canopy water content is a fundamental indicator for assessing the level of plant water stress. The correlation between changes in water content and the spectral reflectance of plant leaves at near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths forms the foundation for developing a new remote sensing index, the Infrared Canopy Dryness Index (ICDI), to monitor forest dryness that can be used to predict the consequences of water stress. This study introduces the index, that uses spectral reflectance analysis at near-infrared wavelengths, encapsulated by the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), in conjunction with specific canopy conditions as depicted by the widely recognized Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Development of the ICDI commenced with the construction of an NDII/NDVI feature space, inspired by a conceptual trapezoid model. This feature space was then parameterized, and the spatial region indicative of water stress conditions, referred to as the dry edge, was identified based on the analysis of 10,000 random observations. The ICDI was produced from the combination of the vertical distance (i.e., under consistent NDVI conditions) from an examined observation to the dry edge. Comparisons between data from drought-affected and non-drought-affected control plots in the Australian Northern Jarrah Forest affirmed that the ICDI effectively depicted forest dryness. Moreover, the index was able to detect incipient water stress several months before damage from an extended drought and heatwave. Using freely available satellite data, the index has potential for broad application in monitoring the onset of forest dryness. This will require validation of the ICDI in diverse forest systems to quantify the efficacy of the index.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/583142ecb7433a60bb489005962b3330abcbd929,583142ecb7433a60bb489005962b3330abcbd929,"Thai Son Le, Bernard Dell, Richard Harper"
"Regional precipitation regimes and evaluation of national precipitation datasets against satellite-based precipitation estimates, Republic of Georgia","
Analyzing water resources in areas with few hydrometeorological stations, such as those in post-Soviet countries, is difficult due to station closures after 1989. In Caucasus, evaluations often rely on outdated data from nearby rivers. We evaluated one national-level precipitation dataset, the Water Balance of Georgia (WBG) with two satellite-based precipitation products from 1981 to 2021, including the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with station data (CHIRPS), and CHIRPS blended with a dense rain gauge network (geoCHIRPS). We modelled mean annual precipitation from geoCHIRPS as a function of coastal distance and elevation. CHIRPS underestimated precipitation in the cold and wet seasons (R2 = 0.74, r = 0.86), and overestimated dry season precipitation, while geoCHIRPS performed well in all seasons (R2 = 0.86, r = 0.92). Distance from the coast was a more important predictor of precipitation than elevation in Western Georgia, while precipitation correlated positively with elevation in the East. At four hydroelectric plants, the underperformance as a percentage of capacity (∼37%) corresponds with the percentage difference between difference in precipitation products (∼38%), suggesting that plants designed based on WBG may be systematically over-designed, but further work is needed to determine the reasons for the underperformance of the plants and frequency. We conclude that 1) existing WBG does not accurately reflect elevation-precipitation relationships near the coast and 2) for accurate analysis of spatiotemporal precipitation variability and its impacts on hydropower generation, environmental and sustainable water resource management, it is essential to calibrate satellite-based precipitation estimates with additional rain gauge data.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bda068bbc08eb88036640c35134ec0d699dcca8a,bda068bbc08eb88036640c35134ec0d699dcca8a,"Nika Tsitelashvili, Trent Biggs, Ye Mu, V.

Feasibility of machine learning-based rice yield prediction in India at the district level using climate reanalysis data,"Yield forecasting, the science of predicting agricultural productivity before the crop harvest occurs, helps a wide range of stakeholders make better decisions around agricultural planning. This study aims to investigate whether machine learning-based yield prediction models can capably predict Kharif season rice yields at the district level in India several months before the rice harvest takes place. The methodology involved training 19 machine learning models such as CatBoost, LightGBM, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, and Extremely Randomized Trees on 20 years of climate, satellite, and rice yield data across 247 of Indian rice-producing districts. In addition to model-building, a dynamic dashboard was built understand how the reliability of rice yield predictions varies across districts. The results of the proof-of-concept machine learning pipeline demonstrated that rice yields can be predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy, with out-of-sample R2, MAE, and MAPE performance of up to 0.82, 0.29, and 0.16 respectively. These results outperformed test set performance reported in related literature on rice yield modeling in other contexts and countries. In addition, SHAP value analysis was conducted to infer both the importance and directional impact of the climate and remote sensing variables included in the model. Important features driving rice yields included temperature, soil water volume, and leaf area index. In particular, higher temperatures in August correlate with increased rice yields, particularly when the leaf area index in August is also high. Building on the results, a proof-of-concept dashboard was developed to allow users to easily explore which districts may experience a rise or fall in yield relative to the previous year.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0423d678a8c6cd32807af96b13f308daafc1d276,0423d678a8c6cd32807af96b13f308daafc1d276,"D.
