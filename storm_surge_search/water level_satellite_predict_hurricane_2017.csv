Hydraulic visibility: Using satellite altimetry to parameterize a hydraulic model of an ungauged reach of a braided river,"What hydraulic information can be gained from remotely sensed observations of a river's surface? In this study, we analyze the relationship between river bed undulations and water surfaces for an ungauged reach of the Xingu River, a first‐order tributary of the Amazon river. This braided reach is crosscut more than 10 times by a ENVISAT (ENVironmental SATellite) track that extends over 100 km. Rating curves based on a modeled discharge series and altimetric measurements are used, including the zero‐flow depth Z0 parameter, which describes river's bathymetry. River widths are determined from JERS (Japanese Earth Ressources Satellite) images. Hydrodynamic laws predict that irregularities in the geometry of a river bed produce spatial and temporal variations in the water level, as well as in its slope. Observation of these changes is a goal of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission, which has a final objective of determining river discharge. First, the concept of hydraulic visibility is introduced, and the seasonality of water surface slope is highlighted along with different flow regimes and reach behaviors. Then, we propose a new single‐thread effective hydraulic approach for modeling braided rivers flows, based on the observation scales of current satellite altimetry. The effective hydraulic model is able to reproduce water surface elevations derived by satellite altimetry, and it shows that hydrodynamical signatures are more visible in areas where the river bed morphology varies significantly and for reaches with strong downstream control. The results of this study suggest that longitudinal variations of the slope might be an interesting criteria for the analysis of river segmentation into elementary reaches for the Surface Water Ocean Topography mission that will provide continuous measurements of the water surface elevations, the slopes, and the reach widths.",2017,54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/584d5dbbcf1293684470bf90b81dfa6995577170,584d5dbbcf1293684470bf90b81dfa6995577170,"P.

Applying the Concept of Ecohydrological Equilibrium to Predict Steady State Leaf Area Index,"Leaf area index (LAI) is a key variable in modeling terrestrial vegetation because it has a major impact on carbon and water fluxes. However, several recent intercomparisons have shown that modeled LAI differs significantly among models and between models and satellite‐derived estimates. Empirical studies show that LAI is strongly related to precipitation. This observation is predicted by the ecohydrological equilibrium theory, which provides an alternative means to predict steady state LAI. We implemented this theory in a simple optimization model. We hypothesized that, when water availability is limited, plants should adjust steady state LAI and stomatal behavior to maximize net canopy carbon export, under the constraint that canopy transpiration is a fixed fraction of total precipitation. We evaluated the predicted LAI (Lopt) for Australia against ground‐based observations of LAI at 135 sites and continental‐scale satellite‐derived estimates. For the site‐level data, the root‐mean‐square error of predicted Lopt was 1.07 m2 m−2, similar to the root‐mean‐square error of a comparison of the data against 9‐year mean satellite‐derived LAI (Lsat) at those sites. Continentally, Lopt had an R2 of 0.7 when compared to Lsat. The predicted Lopt increased continental‐wide with rising atmospheric [CO2] over 1982–2010, which agreed with satellite‐derived estimations, while the predicted stomatal behavior responded differently in dry and wet regions. Our results indicate that long‐term equilibrium LAI can be successfully predicted from a simple application of ecohydrological theory. We suggest that this theory could be usefully incorporated into terrestrial vegetation models to improve their predictions of LAI.",2017,21,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/398e868862f1c70b1583e4ab57f6a67516656349,398e868862f1c70b1583e4ab57f6a67516656349,"Junliang Yang, B.

Assessment of Risk of Cholera in Haiti following Hurricane Matthew.,"Damage to the inferior and fragile water and sanitation infrastructure of Haiti after Hurricane Matthew has created an urgent public health emergency in terms of likelihood of cholera occurring in the human population. Using satellite-derived data on precipitation, gridded air temperature, and hurricane path and with information on water and sanitation (WASH) infrastructure, we tracked changing environmental conditions conducive for growth of pathogenic vibrios. Based on these data, we predicted and validated the likelihood of cholera cases occurring past hurricane. The risk of cholera in the southwestern part of Haiti remained relatively high since November 2016 to the present. Findings of this study provide a contemporary process for monitoring ground conditions that can guide public health intervention to control cholera in human population by providing access to vaccines, safe WASH facilities. Assuming current social and behavioral patterns remain constant, it is recommended that WASH infrastructure should be improved and considered a priority especially before 2017 rainy season.",2017,22,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1db1c5dd21dad2fe9e438660bcbf2745acb056a5,1db1c5dd21dad2fe9e438660bcbf2745acb056a5,"Rakibul Khan, R.

SATELLITE-DERIVED BATHYMETRY: ACCURACY ASSESSMENT ON DEPTHS DERIVATION ALGORITHM FOR SHALLOW WATER AREA,"Abstract. Over the years, the acquisition technique of bathymetric data has evolved from a shipborne platform to airborne and presently, utilising space-borne acquisition. The extensive development of remote sensing technology has brought in the new revolution to the hydrographic surveying. Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB), a space-borne acquisition technique which derives bathymetric data from high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery for various purposes recently considered as a new promising technology in the hydrographic surveying industry. Inspiring by this latest developments, a comprehensive study was initiated by National Hydrographic Centre (NHC) and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) to analyse SDB as a means for shallow water area acquisition. By adopting additional adjustment in calibration stage, a marginal improvement discovered on the outcomes from both Stumpf and Lyzenga algorithms where the RMSE values for the derived (predicted) depths were 1.432 meters and 1.728 meters respectively. This paper would deliberate in detail the findings from the study especially on the accuracy level and practicality of SDB over the tropical environmental setting in Malaysia.",2017,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d14ec663e25d09ef08525eb76773914992a2e25,0d14ec663e25d09ef08525eb76773914992a2e25,"Najhan Md.

"Coastal Sea-Level Measurements Based on GNSS-R Phase Altimetry: A Case Study at the Onsala Space Observatory, Sweden","The characterization of global mean sea level is important to predict floods and to quantify water resources for human use and irrigation, especially in coastal regions. Recently, the application of global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) for water level monitoring has been successfully demonstrated. This paper focuses on the retrieval of sea surface height within a field experiment that was conducted at the Onsala Space Observatory (OSO) using the phase-based altimetry method. A continuous phase tracking algorithm, which relies on the GNSS amplitude and phase observations is proposed and works even under rough sea conditions at OSO’s coast. Factors impacting the phase-based altimetry model, i.e., atmospheric propagation effects of the GNSS signals and influence of the GNSS-R observation instrument, are discussed. The relationship between the yield of coherent GNSS-R compared to the overall recorded events and the wind speed is investigated in detail. Ground-based sea-level measurements from June 10 to July 3, 2015 demonstrate that altimetric information about the reflecting water surface can be obtained with a root mean square error of 4.37 cm with respect to a reference tide gauge (TG) data set. The sea surface changes, derived from our field experiment and the reference TG, are highly correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.93. The altimetric information can be retrieved even when the sea surface is very rough, corresponding to wind speeds up to 13 m/s. Moreover, the use of inexpensive conventional GNSS antennas shows that the system is useful for future large-scale sea level monitoring applications including numerous low-cost coastal ground stations.",2017,33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18f596594781ff1acb051aeb83175c0f5dec02eb,18f596594781ff1acb051aeb83175c0f5dec02eb,"Wei Liu, J.
