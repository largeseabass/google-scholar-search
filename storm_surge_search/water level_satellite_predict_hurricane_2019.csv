RFim: A Real-Time Inundation Extent Model for Large Floodplains Based on Remote Sensing Big Data and Water Level Observations,"The real-time flood inundation extent plays an important role in flood disaster preparation and reduction. To date, many approaches have been developed for determining the flood extent, such as hydrodynamic models, digital elevation model-based (DEM-based) methods, and remote sensing methods. However, hydrodynamic methods are time consuming when applied to large floodplains, high-resolution DEMs are not always available, and remote sensing imagery cannot be used alone to predict inundation. In this article, a new model for the highly accurate and rapid simulation of floodplains, called “RFim” (real-time inundation model), is proposed to simulate the real-time flooded area. The model combines remote sensing images with in situ data to find the relationship between the inundation extent and water level. The new approach takes advantage of remote sensing images, which have wide spatial coverage and high resolution, and in situ observations, which have continuous temporal coverage and are easily accessible. This approach has been applied in the study area of East Dongting Lake, representing a large floodplain, for inundation simulation at a 30 m resolution. Compared with the submerged extent from observations, the accuracy of the simulation could be more than 90% (the lowest is 93%, and the highest is 96%). Hence, the approach proposed in this study is reliable for predicting the flood extent. Moreover, an inundation simulation for all of 2013 was performed with daily water level observation data. With an increasing number of Earth observation satellites operating in space and high-resolution mappers deployed on satellites, it will be much easier to acquire large quantities of images with very high resolutions. Therefore, the use of RFim to perform inundation simulations with high accuracy and high spatial resolutions in the future is promising because the simulation model is built on remote sensing imagery and gauging station data.",2019,9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9c4ceb294c150b593a80ece830dbc6f911e855e2,9c4ceb294c150b593a80ece830dbc6f911e855e2,"Zeqiang Chen, Jin Luo, Nengcheng Chen, Ren Xu, Gaoyun Shen"
Contrasting the Performance of Eight Satellite-Based GPP Models in Water-Limited and Temperature-Limited Grassland Ecosystems,"Models constitute the primary approaches for predicting terrestrial ecosystem gross primary production (GPP) at regional and global scales. Many satellite-based GPP models have been developed due to the simple algorithms and the low requirements of model inputs. The performances of these models are well documented at the biome level. However, their performances among vegetation subtypes limited by different environmental stresses within a biome remains largely unexplored. Taking grasslands in northern China as an example, we compared the performance of eight satellite-based GPP models, including three light-use efficiency (LUE) models (vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM), modified VPM (MVPM), and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer GPP algorithm (MODIS-GPP)) and five statistical models (temperature and greenness model (TG), greenness and radiation model (GR), vegetation index model (VI), alpine vegetation model (AVM), and photosynthetic capacity model (PCM)), between the water-limited temperate steppe and the temperature-limited alpine meadow based on 16 site-year GPP estimates at four eddy covariance (EC) flux towers. The results showed that all the GPP models performed better in the alpine meadow, particularly in the alpine shrub meadow (R2 ≥ 0.84), than in the temperate steppe (R2 ≤ 0.68). The performance varied greatly among the models in the temperate steppe, while slight intermodel differences existed in the alpine meadow. Overall, MVPM (of the LUE models) and VI (of the statistical models) were the two best-performing models in the temperate steppe due to their better representation of the effect of water stress on vegetation productivity. Additionally, we found that the relatively worse model performances in the temperate steppe were seriously exaggerated by drought events, which may occur more frequently in the future. This study highlights the varying performances of satellite-based GPP models among vegetation subtypes of a biome in different precipitation years and suggests priorities for improving the water stress variables of these models in future efforts.",2019,27,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b8cd17f4512b98be0cda2edafc7c04047a5594f,0b8cd17f4512b98be0cda2edafc7c04047a5594f,"Liangxia Zhang, Decheng Zhou, Jiangwen Fan, Q.

River Discharge Estimation based on Satellite Water Extent and Topography: An Application over the Amazon,"
 River discharge (RD) estimates are necessary for many applications, including water management, flood risk, and water cycle studies. Satellite-derived long-term GIEMS-D3 surface water extent (SWE) maps and HydroSHEDS data, at 90-m resolution, are here used to estimate several hydrological quantities at a monthly time scale over a few selected locations within the Amazon basin. Two methods are first presented to derive the water level (WL): the “hypsometric curve” and the “histogram cutoff” approaches at an 18 km × 18 km resolution. The obtained WL values are interpolated over the whole water mask using a bilinear interpolation. The two methods give similar results and validation with altimetry is satisfactory, with a correlation ranging from 0.72 to 0.89 in the seven considered stations over three rivers (i.e., Wingu, Negro, and Solimoes Rivers). River width (RW) and water volume change (WVC) are also estimated. WVC is evaluated with GRACE total water storage change, and correlations range from 0.77 to 0.88. A neural network (NN) statistical model is then used to estimate the RD based on four predictors (SWE, WL, WVC, and RW) and on in situ RD measurements. Results compare well to in situ measurements with a correlation of about 0.97 for the raw data (and 0.84 for the anomalies). The presented methodologies show the potential of historical satellite data (the combination of SWE with topography) to help estimate RD. Our study focuses here on a large river in the Amazon basin at a monthly scale; additional analyses would be required for other rivers, including smaller ones, in different environments, and at higher temporal scale.",2019,8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b829caf3dc679ebef3b17624e73a638c235c2c39,b829caf3dc679ebef3b17624e73a638c235c2c39,"Dinh Thi Lan Anh, F.

"MAPPING POVERTY IN THE PHILIPPINES USING MACHINE LEARNING, SATELLITE IMAGERY, AND CROWD-SOURCED GEOSPATIAL INFORMATION","Mapping the distribution of poverty in developing countries is essential for humanitarian organizations and policymakers to formulate targeted programs and aid. However, traditional methods for obtaining socioeconomic data can be timeconsuming, expensive, labor-intensive. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining machine learning with satellite images to estimate wealth in sub-Saharan African countries (Xie et al., 2015; Jean et al., 2016). In this study, we investigate the extent to which this method can be applied in the context of the Philippine archipelago to predict four different socioeconomic indicators: wealth level, years of education, access to electricity, and access to water. We also propose a cost-effective approach that leverages a combination of volunteered geographic information from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and nighttime lights satellite imagery for estimating socioeconomic indicators. The best models, which incorporate regional indicators as predictors, explain approximately 63% of the variation in asset-based wealth. Our findings also indicate that models trained on publicly available, volunteer-curated geographic data achieve the same predictive performance as that of models trained using proprietary satellite images.",2019,51,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9d96bbd1bab6f66015096336052bd86662e14c6d,9d96bbd1bab6f66015096336052bd86662e14c6d,"I.

A review and framework for the evaluation of pixel-level uncertainty estimates in satellite aerosol remote sensing,"Abstract. Recent years have seen the increasing inclusion of per-retrieval prognostic (predictive) uncertainty estimates within satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data sets, providing users with quantitative tools to assist in the optimal use of these data. Prognostic estimates contrast with diagnostic (i.e. relative to some external truth) ones, which are typically obtained using sensitivity and/or validation analyses. Up to now, however, the quality of these uncertainty estimates has not been routinely assessed. This study presents a review of existing prognostic and diagnostic approaches for quantifying uncertainty in satellite AOD retrievals, and it presents a general framework to evaluate them based on the expected statistical properties of ensembles of estimated uncertainties and actual retrieval errors. It is hoped that this framework will be adopted as a complement to existing AOD validation exercises; it is not restricted to AOD and can in principle be applied to other quantities for which a reference validation data set is available. This framework is then applied to assess the uncertainties provided by several satellite data sets (seven over land, five over water), which draw on methods from the empirical to sensitivity analyses to formal error propagation, at 12 Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites. The AERONET sites are divided into those for which it is expected that the techniques will perform well and those for which some complexity about the site may provide a more severe test. Overall, all techniques show some skill in that larger estimated uncertainties are generally associated with larger observed errors, although they are sometimes poorly calibrated (i.e. too small or too large in magnitude). No technique uniformly performs best. For powerful formal uncertainty propagation approaches such as optimal estimation, the results illustrate some of the difficulties in appropriate population of the covariance matrices required by the technique. When the data sets are confronted by a situation strongly counter to the retrieval forward model (e.g. potentially mixed land–water surfaces or aerosol optical properties outside the family of assumptions), some algorithms fail to provide a retrieval, while others do but with a quantitatively unreliable uncertainty estimate. The discussion suggests paths forward for the refinement of these techniques.

Applying Upstream Satellite Signals and a 2-D Error Minimization Algorithm to Advance Early Warning and Management of Flood Water Levels and River Discharge,"Recent studies demonstrate the power of applying satellite imagery in combination with artificial intelligence (AI) methods to advance the accuracy of forecasting ungauged river network water levels and discharge for early flood warning and management. In predicting river water levels and discharge time series, one of the most common sources of error with AI forecasting algorithms is the input imitation defect. When the input imitation defect occurs, regression methods simply present the input variables as output. In this paper, the input imitation defect is minimized by first introducing the two concepts of vertical error and horizontal error. Subsequently, upstream imagery information is combined with previous lags to propose a new procedure for predicting future satellite signals accurately and with the lowest possible input imitation defect. To accomplish this, the brightness temperature received by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer is used as a proxy of river discharge. The proposed method (PM) is finally compared with the simple linear regression and three well-known AI methods, i.e., multilayer perceptron, extreme learning machines, and radial basis function. The study outcome indicates that the PM results are more trustworthy and realistic.",2019,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f1e320944065eb9b1af22f58d6c4b48c88670fe5,f1e320944065eb9b1af22f58d6c4b48c88670fe5,"A.
