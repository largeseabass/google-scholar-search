Sea level rise quantification and projection using multi-mission satellite altimeter over Malaysian seas,"The increase of anthropogenic activities has triggered rising global sea levels and threatens many low-lying and unprotected coastal areas. Without countermeasures, global sea levels will continue to rise at an accelerating rate in the 21st century. Geographically, Malaysia is epitomized by its unique geographical settings and is surrounded by water, hence a comprehensive study of the seas is vital for local management to take significant measures to understand and protect Malaysian coastline from threatening disasters. This study makes a significant effort to quantify and project sea level trends for this region by taking into account regional sea temperature changes. It presents an approach to quantify sea level trends based on multi-mission satellite altimeters over Malaysian seas. Future projection of sea levels was performed for every 20 years from 2020 to 2100. Multi-mission satellite altimetry data for Sea Level Anomalies and Sea Surface Temperature was processed using the Radar Altimeter Database System. Radar Altimeter Database System performs enhanced processing strategies for the derivation of sea level anomalies, including filtering, gridding, and moving average. The daily solutions of this data were combined into monthly average solutions for sea level rise quantification and projection. The assessment results show similar sea level anomaly patterns of high correlation coefficients (>0.9) and small (few cm) Root mean square errors between sea level anomalies from altimetry and tide gauges over the same period. Subsequently, sea level trends were determined using robust fit regression analysis for the sea level anomaly time series, where the sea level rise trends around Malaysia ranged from 3.37 ± 0.13 mm yr-1 off Peninsular Malaysia to 5.00 ± 0.10 mm yr-1 off Sabah and Sarawak with an overall mean of 4.17 ± 0.16 mm yr-1. From 1993 to 2015, cumulative sea level rise was 4.86 cm. During the 21st century, Malaysian seas will encounter a rise of 6.07 cm by 2020, 13.15 cm by 2040, 20.23 cm by 2060, 27.31 cm by 2080, and 34.39 cm by 2100. Information on sea level changes in this region is valuable for a wide variety of climate applications and for studying environmental issues such as global warming in Malaysia. It is also important for its relevance to predicting future regional climates for disaster adaptation measures.",2018,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f5900443d2061598ead65bf2f24fe6c888fea89d,f5900443d2061598ead65bf2f24fe6c888fea89d,"A.

Multi-Task Deep Learning for Predicting Poverty From Satellite Images,"
 
 Estimating economic and developmental parameters such as poverty levels of a region from satellite imagery is a challenging problem that has many applications. We propose a two step approach to predict poverty in a rural region from satellite imagery. First, we engineer a multi-task fully convolutional deep network for simultaneously predicting the material of roof, source of lighting and source of drinking water from satellite images. Second, we use the predicted developmental statistics to estimate poverty. Using full-size satellite imagery as input, and without pre-trained weights, our models are able to learn meaningful features including roads, water bodies and farm lands, and achieve a performance that is close to the optimum. In addition to speeding up the training process, the multi-task fully convolutional model is able to discern task specific and independent feature representations.

"Predicting culturable enterococci exceedances at Escambron Beach, San Juan, Puerto Rico using satellite remote sensing and artificial neural networks.","Predicting recreational water quality is key to protecting public health from exposure to wastewater-associated pathogens. It is not feasible to monitor recreational waters for all pathogens; therefore, monitoring programs use fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), such as enterococci, to identify wastewater pollution. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to predict when culturable enterococci concentrations exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Recreational Water Quality Criteria (RWQC) at Escambron Beach, San Juan, Puerto Rico. Ten years of culturable enterococci data were analyzed together with satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), direct normal irradiance (DNI), turbidity, and dew point, along with local observations of precipitation and mean sea level (MSL). The factors identified as the most relevant for enterococci exceedance predictions based on the U.S. EPA RWQC were DNI, turbidity, cumulative 48 h precipitation, MSL, and SST; they predicted culturable enterococci exceedances with an accuracy of 75% and power greater than 60% based on the Receiving Operating Characteristic curve and F-Measure metrics. Results show the applicability of satellite-derived data and ANNs to predict recreational water quality at Escambron Beach. Future work should incorporate local sanitary survey data to predict risky recreational water conditions and protect human health.",2018,11,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa1d50f5e9a8aa49fb9e1cf48a54105df9917ef4,fa1d50f5e9a8aa49fb9e1cf48a54105df9917ef4,"A.

BLUEWATER EYE: using satellite as a low cost water pollution sensor: analytics for deriving long term pollution insights based on mapping water turbidity,"Bluewater EYE analytics bring the power of remote sensing backed by artificial intelligence to address several water pollution related challenges at low cost as it requires minimal calibration with Internet of Things (IoT) data and can provide useful water quality insights via spatio-temporal pollution signatures mapped over possibly large distances, applicable to any global water body. We leverage geo-spatial data analytics in combination with cloud based, real-time in-situ sensing, that is capable of mapping changes in water turbidity of a water resource. Spatio-temporal pollution insights are derived and represented via color-based heatmaps and matrices that are overlaid on Google maps and facilitate visualization and identification of pollution hotspots. Methods include first-order correlations derived from surface reflectance of different satellite band/s (single or a normalized difference combination) and high resolution, geo-tagged, in-situ turbidity sensing via a moving multi-parameter sensor platform. Significant improvements in correlation (upto 80%) were obtained by using statistical methods such as moving average for filtering out the sensing data associated noise. Moreover, we use machine learning based approach for training a turbidity model based on Support vector machine (SVM) regression with Radial Basis Kernel (RBF). The predicted turbidity values for the selected region based on Landsat 8 Level 2 surface reflectance data, was then applied for time-series data for historical years of 2016 and 2017. The turbidity time series so obtained is analyzed to capture any significant variations in water quality due to various factors (event or season based). We propose a method to analyze pollution contributions from different individual sources, that is based on assigning an individual spatio-temporal signature in the form of a color-coded matrix. Overall, Bluewater EYE could be useful for capturing water quality spatio-temporal information and trends, providing data driven proofs for timely alerts and advisory and other useful insights for implementation of appropriate remediation measures and interventions– all this at an affordable cost.",2018,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bd60cb03fdba8a90a55b08210f9dead5c15c8c69,bd60cb03fdba8a90a55b08210f9dead5c15c8c69,"S.
