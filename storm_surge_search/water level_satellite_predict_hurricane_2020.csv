Exploiting satellite technology and machine learning to describe and predict hazardous shoreline change,"
 <p>East Anglia is particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, increases in storminess, coastal erosion, and coastal flooding. Critical national infrastructure (including Sizewell&#8217;s nuclear power stations and the Bacton gas terminals), population centres close to the coastal zone (> 600,000 in Norfolk and Suffolk) and iconic natural habitats (the Broads, attracting 7 million visitors a year) are under threat. Shoreline change, driven by complex interactions between environmental forcing factors and human shoreline modifications, is a key determinant of coastal vulnerability and exposure; its prediction is imperative for future coastal risk adaptation.</p><p>An automated, python-supported, tool has been developed to simultaneously extract the water and vegetation line from satellite imagery. PlanetLab multispectral optical imagery is used to provide multi-year, frequent (up to fortnightly) images with 3-5m spatial resolution. Net shoreline change (NSC) has been calculated along multiple stretches of the East Coast of England, most notably for areas experiencing varying rates of change in front of, and adjacent to, &#8216;hard&#8217; coastal defences. The joint use of water and vegetation line proxies enables calculation of inter-tidal width variability alongside NSC. The image resolution used provides new opportunities for data-led approaches to the monitoring of shoreline response to storm events and/or human shoreline modification.</p><p>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been trained to predict shoreline evolution until 2040. Early results are presented, alongside considerations surrounding data pre-processing and input parameter selection requirements. Training data comprises decadal-scale shoreline positions recovered using automated shoreline detection. Shoreline position, alongside databases of nearshore bathymetry, sea defences, artificial beach renourishment, nearshore processes (wave and tide gauge data, meteorological fields), combined with land cover, population and infrastructure data act as inputs. Optimal input filtering and ANN configuration is derived using hindcasts.</p><p>The research is timely; ANN predictions are compared with the Anglian Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs), which identify locations at greatest risk and assign future risk management funding. The findings of this research will feed into future revisions of the plans.</p>

Can GNSS-R Detect Abrupt Water Level Changes?,"Global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) uses signals of opportunity in a bi-static configuration of L-band microwave radar to retrieve environmental variables such as water level. The line-of-sight signal and its coherent surface reflection signal are not separate observables in geodetic GNSS-R. The temporally constructive and destructive oscillations in the recorded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observations can be used to retrieve water-surface levels at intermediate spatial scales that are proportional to the height of the GNSS antenna above the water surface. In this contribution, SNR observations are used to retrieve water levels at the Vianden Pumped Storage Plant (VPSP) in Luxembourg, where the water-surface level abruptly changes up to 17 m every 4-8 h to generate a peak current when the energy demand increases. The GNSS-R water level retrievals are corrected for the vertical velocity and acceleration of the water surface. The vertical velocity and acceleration corrections are important corrections that mitigate systematic errors in the estimated water level, especially for VPSP with such large water-surface changes. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the 10-min multi-GNSS water level time series and water level gauge records is 7.0 cm for a one-year period, with a 0.999 correlation coefficient. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-R can be used as a new complementary approach to study hurricanes or storm surges that cause abnormal rises of water levels.",2020,10,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/68c56c4f5311411df786b30eeee6b0000b53f78f,68c56c4f5311411df786b30eeee6b0000b53f78f,"S.

Least squares techniques for extracting water level Fluctuations in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea,"Extracting the main cyclic fluctuations from sea level changes of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea is vital for understanding the behavior of tides and isolating non-tidal impacts such as those related to climate and changes in the ocean-sea circulations. This study compares two spectral analysis methods including: Least Squares Spectral Analysis (LSSA) and Least Squares Harmonic Estimation (LSHE), to analyze satellite altimetry derived sea surface height changes of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea. SSH data are derived from about 16 years of satellite altimetry observations (1992 to 2008), including the Topex/Poseidon and Jason-1 missions. By analyzing the real data, we extract significant tidal components in the spectrum of LSSA and LS-HE including those with the period of 62.07, 173.3, 58.71, 45.68, 88.86, 364.2 and 117.5 days, which are interpreted as Principal Lunar semi-diurnal, Luni-Solar Diurnal, Principal Solar Semi-diurnal, Principal Lunar Diurnal, GAM2, annual, Solar Diurnal periods are dominant in the level fluctuations. Moreover, some tidal components appear in the spectrum of LSSA and LS-HE, from which the Moon's semi-diurnal component  is dominant. Also, to evaluate the efficiency of these two techniques, we run three experiments in each extracted frequency from LSSA, LS-HE, and astronomical tide tables are separately used to predict the sea level in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea for three years. The results of this prediction indicate that RMSE from LSSA, astronomical table, and LS-HE is 0.101 m, 0.093 m, and 0. 086 m, respectively. According to the results LS-HE is found a more efficient technique to analyze cyclic fluctuations from altimetry measurements.",2020,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f86c8bbe1ca4ef8e087ad5ccf65ea9f1a864ab96,f86c8bbe1ca4ef8e087ad5ccf65ea9f1a864ab96,"سعید فرزانه, Kamal Parvazi, E.

Relationship of spatial and temporal characteristics of water conditions and Rastreliger kanagurta production in the Malacca Strait using satellite imagery,"The eastern coast waters of North Sumatra is a fishing ground with a high level of exploitation. One of commodity catches in the eastern coast of Sumatra is mackarel (Rastrelliger kanagurta). By understanding the parameters of oceanography, especially sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a, it can help to predict fishing area which are used as a guide for the purpose of fishes catching or exploitation. One of the satellites that can detect sea water temperature and chlorophyll-a is Aqua (EOS PM) with a moderate resolution imaging spectro radiometer sensor (MODIS). Mackerel catch data were obtained from ocean fishing port in Belawan. Sea surface temperature eastern coast of North Sumatra based on Aqua MODIS image analysis ranged from 29.55-31.66°C, and chlorophyll-a distribution has a range of 1.56-4.65 mg/m3. Mackerel catches fluctuations every month. The highest average catch is 232.174 tons which occurred in February. While the lowest catch is 201.457 which occurred in May. The results of the correlation between catching mackerel and sea surface temperature of -0.337 have a weak and not direct relationship. Relationship of chlorophyll-a with catches obtained a positive correlation value of 0.660 which indicates that between chlorophyll-a and catches has a strong and direct relationship.",2020,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b739b2f18ca8560849a712ace85fcc86b4cc763d,b739b2f18ca8560849a712ace85fcc86b4cc763d,"Z.

"Estimation of high-resolution PM2.5 over Indo-Gangetic Plain by fusion of satellite data, meteorology, and land use variables.","Very high spatially resolved satellite-derived ground-level PM2.5 concentrations have multiple potential applications especially in air quality modelling, epidemiological and climatological research. Satellite-derived aerosol optical epth (AOD), and columnar water vapor (CWV), meteorological parameters, and land use data were used as variables within a linear mixed effect model (LME) and a random forest (RF) model, to predict daily ground-level concentrations of PM2.5 at 1km×1km grid across the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) in South Asia. The RF model exhibited superior performance and higher accuracy than the LME model, with higher cross-validated explained variance (R2=0.87) and lower relative prediction error (RPE=24.5%). The RF model revealed improved performance metrics for increasing averaging periods, from daily to weekly, monthly, seasonal, and annual means, which supports using it to estimate PM2.5 exposure metrics across the IGP at varying temporal scales (i.e. both short and long terms). The RF-based PM2.5 estimates show high PM2.5 levels over the middle and lower IGP, with the annual mean exceeding 110μg/m3. Seasonally, winter was the most polluted season while monsoon was the cleanest. Spatially, the middle and lower IGP showed poorer air quality compared to the upper IGP. In winter, the middle and lower IGP experience very poor air quality, with mean PM2.5 concentrations >170μg/m3.",2020,70,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/606a66f5bbdb1053d7126e107687a3c3ebee5eb6,606a66f5bbdb1053d7126e107687a3c3ebee5eb6,"Alaa Mhawish, T.
