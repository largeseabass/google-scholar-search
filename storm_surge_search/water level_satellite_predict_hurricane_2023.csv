A Model Integrating Satellite‐Derived Shoreline Observations for Predicting Fine‐Scale Shoreline Response to Waves and Sea‐Level Rise Across Large Coastal Regions,"Satellite‐derived shoreline observations combined with dynamic shoreline models enable fine‐scale predictions of coastal change across large spatiotemporal scales. Here, we present a satellite‐data‐assimilated, “littoral‐cell”‐based, ensemble Kalman‐filter shoreline model to predict coastal change and uncertainty due to waves, sea‐level rise (SLR), and other natural and anthropogenic processes. We apply the developed ensemble model to the entire California coastline (approximately 1,760 km), much of which is sparsely monitored with traditional survey methods (e.g., Lidar/GPS). Water‐level‐corrected, satellite‐derived shoreline observations (obtained from the CoastSat toolbox) offer a nearly unbiased representation of in situ surveyed shorelines (e.g., mean sea‐level elevation contours) at Ocean Beach, San Francisco. We demonstrate that model calibration with satellite observations during a 20‐year hindcast period (1995–2015) provides nearly equivalent model forecast accuracy during a validation period (2015–2020) compared to model calibration with monthly in situ observations at Ocean Beach. When comparing model‐predicted shoreline positions to satellite‐derived observations, the model achieves an accuracy of <10 m RMSE for nearly half of the entire California coastline for the validation period. The calibrated/validated model is then applied for multi‐decadal simulations of shoreline change due to projected wave and sea‐level conditions, while holding the model parameters fixed. By 2100, the model estimates that 24%–75% of California's beaches may become completely eroded due to SLR scenarios of 1.0–3.0 m, respectively. The satellite‐data‐assimilated modeling system presented here is generally applicable to a variety of coastal settings around the world owing to the global coverage of satellite imagery.",2023,18,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/38cbac7a6f8fe51276140b5e48f149d6de91cd51,38cbac7a6f8fe51276140b5e48f149d6de91cd51,"S.

STUDY OF CROSS-SHORE PROFILES AT SOUTH COASTS OF THE CASPIAN SEA UNDER RAPID CHANGES IN WATER LEVEL,"Coastal zone management needs the prediction of the changes in shoreline and coastal profiles, where the fluctuation of sea water level plays an essential role. Climate change and human activities have accelerated the fluctuation/falling of water levels in lakes and enclosed water basins. Using satellite images and cross-shore beach profiles at twelve monitoring stations along the southern coasts of the Caspian Sea, the effect of the rapid fall of water level on the nearshore morphology is studied in this research. Radiometric and atmospheric corrections are made on satellite images, and the NDWI index is used to increase the accuracy of the shoreline extraction. Comparing the accuracy of different methods, it is concluded that the Hands (1984) formula relatively better predicts the shoreline advancement rate due to lowering water level.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0464fb4b87740c21b5905bb8c5aca3ead55c9f07,0464fb4b87740c21b5905bb8c5aca3ead55c9f07,"Hesamodin Enayati, Mohsen Soltanpour, T.

Modelling extreme water levels using intertidal topography and bathymetry derived from multispectral satellite images,"Abstract. Topographic and bathymetric data are essential for accurate predictions of flooding in estuaries because water depth and elevation data are fundamental components of the shallow-water hydrodynamic equations used in models for storm surges and tides. Where lidar or in situ acoustic surveys are unavailable, recent efforts have centred on using satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) and satellite-derived topography (SDT). This work is aimed at (1) determining the accuracy of SDT and (2) assessing the suitability of the SDT and SDB for extreme water level modelling of estuaries. The SDT was created by extracting the waterline as it tracks over the topography with changing tides. The method was applied to four different estuaries in Aotearoa / New Zealand: Whitianga, Maketū, Ōhiwa and Tauranga harbours. Results show that the waterline method provides similar topography to the lidar with a root-mean-square error equal to 0.2 m, and it is slightly improved when two correction methods are applied to the topography derivations: the removal of statistical bias (0.02 m improvement) and hydrodynamic modelling correction of waterline elevation (0.01 m improvement). The use of SDT in numerical simulations of surge levels was assessed for Tauranga Harbour in eight different simulation scenarios. Each scenario explored different ways of incorporating the SDT to replace the topographic data collected using non-satellite survey methods. In addition, one of these scenarios combined SDT (for intertidal zones) and SDB (for subtidal bathymetry), so only satellite information is used in surge modelling. The latter SDB is derived using the well-known ratio–log method. For Tauranga Harbour, using SDT and SDB in hydrodynamic models does not result in significant differences in predicting high water levels when compared with the scenario modelled using surveyed bathymetry.

Evaluating the Impacts of COSMIC-2 GNSS RO Bending Angle Assimilation on Atlantic Hurricane Forecasts Using the HWRF Model,"
This study evaluates the impact of assimilating Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) bending angles from Formosa Satellite Mission-7/Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate-2 (COSMIC-2) receiver satellites on Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) model tropical cyclone (TC) forecasts. Launched in June 2019, the COSMIC-2 mission provides significantly higher tropics data coverage compared to its predecessor COSMIC constellation. GNSS RO measurements yield information about atmospheric pressure, temperature, and water vapor profiles. HWRF is cycled with and without COSMIC-2 bending angle data assimilation for six 2020 Atlantic hurricane cases. COSMIC-2 assimilation has little impact on HWRF track forecasts, consistent with HWRF’s design limiting cycled data assimilation impacts on surrounding large-scale flows; however, COSMIC-2 assimilation results in a statistically significant ~ 8-12 % mean absolute forecast error reduction in minimum central sea-level pressure for t = 36, 54, 60, and 108-120 hour lead times. Forecasts initialized from analyses assimilating COSMIC-2 observations also have a 1-4 % smaller 600-700 hPa specific humidity (SPFH) root-mean-squared-deviation compared to radiosondes and dropwindsondes for most lead times. While not all HWRF intensity forecasts benefit from COSMIC-2 assimilation, a few show notable improvement. For example, assimilating two COSMIC-2 profiles within the inner core of developing Hurricane Hanna (2020) increases 800-hPa SPFH by up to 1 g kg−1 locally, helping correct a dry bias. The forecast initialized from this analysis better captures Hanna’s observed intensification rate, likely because its moister inner core facilitates development of persistent deep convection near the TC center, where diabatic heating is more efficiently converted to cyclonic wind kinetic energy.",2023,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/23a29e6c39d97b8ddfd274f37928dd1ecd731c20,23a29e6c39d97b8ddfd274f37928dd1ecd731c20,"W.

Monitoring Inland Water Quantity Variations: A Comprehensive Analysis of Multi-Source Satellite Observation Technology Applications,"The advancement of multi-source Earth observation technology has led to a substantial body of literature on inland water monitoring. This has resulted in the emergence of a distinct interdisciplinary field encompassing the application of multi-source Earth observation techniques in inland water monitoring. Despite this growth, few systematic reviews of this field exist. Therefore, in this paper, we offer a comprehensive analysis based on 30,212 publications spanning the years 1990 to 2022, providing valuable insights. We collected and analyzed fundamental information such as publication year, country, affiliation, journal, and author details. Through co-occurrence analysis, we identified country and author partnerships, while co-citation analysis revealed the influence of journals, authors, and documents. We employed keywords to explore the evolution of hydrological phenomena and study areas, using burst analysis to predict trends and frontiers. We discovered exponential growth in this field with a closer integration of hydrological phenomena and Earth observation techniques. The research focus has shifted from large glaciers to encompass large river basins and the Tibetan Plateau. Long-term research attention has been dedicated to optical properties, sea level, and satellite gravity. The adoption of automatic image recognition and processing, enabled by deep learning and artificial intelligence, has opened new interdisciplinary avenues. The results of the study emphasize the significance of long-term, stable, and accurate global observation and monitoring of inland water, particularly in the context of cloud computing and big data.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7da06fb3dea5d02624143b2268d4564da2e7857,c7da06fb3dea5d02624143b2268d4564da2e7857,"Zhengkai Huang, Xin Wu, Haihong Wang, C.

Mapping Vegetation Water Content over Agricultural Landscapes Using Satellite C- and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar,"Monitoring vegetation water content (VWC) over large spatial extents has become an important part of healthy ecosystem management, drought & wild fire risk assessment and precision agriculture. In this work we use two currently operational satellite synthetical aperture radar (SAR) systems, X-band KOMPSAT 5 and C-band Sentinel 1, to retrieve radar vegetation index (RVI) values over a wheat cropping field located in the state of Victoria, Australia. One quad-polarized RVI (KOMPSAT 5) and two types of dual-polarized RVIs (Sentinel 1 and KOMPSAT 5) were compared with the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) derived Sentinel 2 as an indicator of VWC. The efficacy of RVI values in estimating VWC over wheat cropping field was examined at four different growth stages in May (sowing), June (Tillering), July (Stem Extension), and September (Heading) in 2019. Our results show that, for both Sentinel-1 and KOMPSAT-5, RVIs tested have a moderate skill to predict VWC when the comparison and evaluation were performed over multiple crop growth stages, but they present poor skill to predict VWC for a single snapshot of NDWI maps. This is in part due to the small range of VWC variation within the experimental field for each snapshot map. Quad-pol RVI outperformed dual-pol RVIs in predicting NDWI in multi-temporal application. However, all examined RVIs exhibited saturation for high NDWI conditions (NDWI > 0.5). RVI values also presented widely scattered variation for all examined growth stages. Sub-footprint-scale heterogeneity of the surface roughness and biomass, along with inherent noise of SAR, may contribute to high scatter of RVIs at individual snapshot level mapping.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4bdd5819f0abc0944e11cd73e254818d32c2caf,f4bdd5819f0abc0944e11cd73e254818d32c2caf,"Dongryeol Ryu, Sun-Gu Lee"
