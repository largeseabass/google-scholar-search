Genetic Diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in the United States of America: The Least Endemic Country for Chagas Disease,"Chagas disease (CD), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and endemic in Latin America, has become an emergent health problem in non-endemic countries due to human migration. The United States (US) is the non-Latin American country with the highest CD burden and cannot be considered as non-endemic, since triatomine vectors and reservoir animals have been found. Populations of T. cruzi are divided into genetic subdivisions, which are known as discrete typing units (DTUs): TcI to TcVI and TcBat. Autochthonous human T. cruzi infection in the US is sporadic, but it may change due to environmental factors affecting the geographic distribution of triatomines. We aimed to perform a literature review of the genetic diversity of T. cruzi in triatomine vectors and mammalian hosts, including human cases, in the US. The 34 analyzed studies revealed the presence of T. cruzi in 18 states, which was mainly concentrated in Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. TcI and TcIV were the principal DTUs identified, being TcI the most genotyped (42.4%; 917/2164). This study represents a first attempt to compile the molecular epidemiology of T. cruzi in the US, which is fundamental for predicting the progression of the infection in the country and could be of great help in its future management.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db8eb16c17632cde118446a8a08b9e98bbcd87c6,db8eb16c17632cde118446a8a08b9e98bbcd87c6,"Arnau Llovera, Alba Abras, A.

"Prevalence and Diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in Triatomine Vectors and Their Blood Meal Sources from South Central Texas, USA","Simple Summary Chagas disease is endemic to the state of Texas in the United States but does not have consistent surveillance or reporting. We utilized multiple sampling sites and different species of triatomine to gain data on the blood meal sources found by DNA testing for the host and vector species identities. From domestic, peridomestic, and rural sites, we found a breadth of blood meal origins including mammals, chickens, and reptiles. Unique non-native taxa utilized for blood meals enabled us to also report on extensive foraging distances for the vectors. Understanding the diversity of blood meal sources and the distances the vectors travel between meals and daytime refuges are both important aspects for understanding the spread of this disease. Abstract The prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi was assessed in 117 triatomine insects from central Texas. The qPCR-based results revealed T. cruzi in 59% of the insects (62 adults and eight nymphs), with overall prevalences of T. cruzi of 0% (0/9), 64% (11/17), 58% (10/17), 73% (30/41), and 57% (19/33) for the Bastrop, Caldwell, Gonzales, Guadalupe, and Hays counties, respectively. Analyses of 18S rRNA fragments confirmed T. cuzi in 81% of these samples. Vectors were identified as Triatoma gerstaeckeri (35% of which 65% were positive for T. cruzi), T. sanguisuga (21%, 43% positive), and Paratriatoma leticularia (0.3%, 100% positive). Food sources were recovered from 29% of the insects. Raccoons were 53% of the blood meals (83% positive for T. cruzi), while the remainder came from a variety of sources, including humans (33% positive), house geckos, Eastern woodrats, plain-bellied water snakes (50% positive), hispid cotton rats (0% positive), chickens (100% positive); Asian forest turtles, bison, and pigs (0% positive). The serendipitous detection of blood meal sources at known minimum distances from the collection of the vector insect enabled us to provide several instances where the insect foraging distance was greater than 400 m. These vector foraging distances are novel information that can assist in our understanding of the landscape dynamics for the spread of the pathogen.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2576777420e5679266daee09fb131ac109752017,2576777420e5679266daee09fb131ac109752017,"Rebecca J.

A scoping review of triatomine control for Chagas disease prevention: current and developing tools in Latin America and the United States.,"Chagas disease is an infectious disease of human and animal health concern, with 6-8 million chronic human infections and over 50,000 deaths throughout the Americas annually. Hematophagous insects of the subfamily Triatominae, also called kissing bugs, vector the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas (Trypanosomatida: Trypanosomatidae), that causes Chagas disease. Despite the large human health burden, Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease with inadequate funding for research and preventive practices. Given the resource-poor environment of most agencies trying to protect public health, it is critical to consider all control options for reducing vector populations and the risk of human exposure to T. cruzi to identify the most appropriate tools for each context. While numerous triatomine control methods exist, the literature lacks a compilation of the strategies used, a critical examination of their efficiency, and a particular focus on triatomine control in the United States compared to elsewhere in the Americas. Here, we present a review of the literature to assess historical intervention strategies of existing and developing triatomine control methods. For each method, we discuss progress in the field, future research to further advance the method, and limitations. While we found that pyrethroid insecticide is still the most commonly used method of triatomine and Chagas disease control, we suggest that complementing these techniques with alternative control methods in development will help to achieve Chagas disease reduction goals.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d60aeb4fa06a1ecf143960a7e3163f4a04ce0560,d60aeb4fa06a1ecf143960a7e3163f4a04ce0560,"Yuexun Tian, Cassandra Durden, G.

First Report of Chagas Disease Vector Species Triatoma sanguisuga (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) Infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in Delaware,"ABSTRACT. In July and October 2023, two live triatomine bugs were found inside a home in New Castle County, Delaware. The bugs were identified as Triatoma sanguisuga, the most widespread triatomine bug species in the United States. Triatoma sanguisuga is a competent vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The two specimens were tested via real-time PCR (qPCR) for infection with T. cruzi, and one of the specimens was positive. Despite T. sanguisuga being endemic to the area, attainment of accurate species identification and T. cruzi testing of the bugs required multiple calls to federal, state, private, and academic institutions over several months. This constitutes the first report of T. sanguisuga infected with T. cruzi in Delaware. In addition, this is the first published report of T. sanguisuga in New Castle County, the northernmost and most densely populated county in Delaware. New Castle County still conforms to the described geographic range of T. sanguisuga, which spans from Texas to the East Coast of the United States. The T. cruzi infection prevalence of the species has not been studied in the northeastern United States, but collections in southern states have found prevalences as high as 60%. The Delaware homeowner’s lengthy pursuit of accurate information about the vector highlights the need for more research on this important disease vector in Delaware.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6eea8f8e7462f73401ae4afe11fbdc70e0d80d87,6eea8f8e7462f73401ae4afe11fbdc70e0d80d87,"Jennifer K.

First Report of Seropositivity to Trypanosoma cruzi in Mexican Afro-Descendants from Guerrero and Oaxaca States,"Mexican Afro-descendant is a population poorly studied in many aspects, between them the infectious diseases that they suffer. This population is mainly found in the country's Pacific (Oaxaca and Guerrero states) and Atlantic (Veracruz) coast. In these regions, a diversity of triatomine vectors of the Chagas disease is found. Also, all the genotypes of Trypanosoma cruzi DTUs have been reported. That is why the present study aimed to study the presence of antibodies against T. cruzi and cardiac pathology associated with the Chagas disease in the Mexican Afro-descendant population of Guerrero and Oaxaca. ELISA, Western blot, and recombinant antigen's ELISA were used to evaluate the seropositivity of these communities. Furthermore, an electrocardiographic study and evaluation of risk factors associated with T. cruzi infection in the Oaxaca and Guerrero populations were conducted. 26.77% of the analyzed population was positive for two serological tests. These percentages are higher than the previously reported for the mestizo population in similar studies. Electrocardiographic results showed cardiac disorder associated with the Chagas disease in the population. Also, risk factors were identified associated with the men's activities in the outdoor working areas.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf626ae0f6e8462081535724997c0c4bc60ad9a2,bf626ae0f6e8462081535724997c0c4bc60ad9a2,"B.

Ecological interactions of Triatoma sanguisuga (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) and risk for human infection with Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in Illinois and Louisiana.,"Triatoma sanguisuga (Leconte) is one of the most widely distributed kissing bugs in the United States, associated with an extensive zoonotic circulation of Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, in a large part of the country. However, the actual risk for human infection in the United States is poorly understood. Here, we further assessed the ecology of T. sanguisuga bugs collected in residents' houses in Illinois and Louisiana, using a metagenomic approach to identify their blood-feeding sources, T. cruzi parasites and gut microbiota. Blood meal analysis revealed feeding on domestic animals (dogs, cats, pigs, goats, and turkeys), synanthropic species (raccoons, opossums, and squirrels), as well as the more sylvatic white-tail deer. Human blood was identified in 11/14 (78%) of bugs, highlighting a frequent vector-human contact. The infection rate with T. cruzi was 53% (8/15), and most infected bugs (6/8) had fed on humans. A total of 41 bacterial families were identified, with significant differences in microbiota alpha and beta diversity between bugs from Louisiana and Illinois. However, predicted metabolic functions remained highly conserved, suggesting important constraints to fulfill their role in bug biology. These results confirmed a significant risk for vector-borne transmission of T. cruzi to humans in Louisiana and Illinois, which warrants more active screening for human infections. Also, while there is broad plasticity in the bacterial composition of T. sanguisuga microbiota, there are strong constraints to preserve metabolic profile and function, making it a good target for novel vector control strategies.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/35c6b1a0a1bca0a50cdca920927fd33298c5a230,35c6b1a0a1bca0a50cdca920927fd33298c5a230,"Eric Dumonteil, Weihong Tu, F.

Comparative proteomic analysis of the hemolymph and salivary glands of Rhodnius prolixus and R. colombiensis reveals candidates associated with differential lytic activity against Trypanosoma cruzi Dm28c and T. cruzi Y,"Background Immune response of triatomines plays an important role in the success or failure of transmission of T. cruzi. Studies on parasite–vector interaction have shown the presence of trypanolytic factors and have been observed to be differentially expressed among triatomines, which affects the transmission of some T. cruzi strains or DTUs (Discrete Typing Units). Methodology/Principal findings Trypanolytic factors were detected in the hemolymph and saliva of R. prolixus against epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of the Y strain (T. cruzi II). To identify the components of the immune response that could be involved in this lytic activity, a comparative proteomic analysis was carried out, detecting 120 proteins in the hemolymph of R. prolixus and 107 in R. colombiensis. In salivary glands, 1103 proteins were detected in R. prolixus and 853 in R. colombiensis. A higher relative abundance of lysozyme, prolixin, nitrophorins, and serpin as immune response proteins was detected in the hemolymph of R. prolixus. Among the R. prolixus salivary proteins, a higher relative abundance of nitrophorins, lipocalins, and triabins was detected. The higher relative abundance of these immune factors in R. prolixus supports their participation in the lytic activity on Y strain (T. cruzi II), but not on Dm28c (T. cruzi I), which is resistant to lysis by hemolymph and salivary proteins of R. prolixus due to mechanisms of evading oxidative stress caused by immune factors. Conclusions/Significance The lysis resistance observed in the Dm28c strain would be occurring at the DTU I level. T. cruzi I is the DTU with the greatest geographic distribution, from the south of the United States to central Chile and Argentina, a distribution that could be related to resistance to oxidative stress from vectors. Likewise, we can say that lysis against strain Y could occur at the level of DTU II and could be a determinant of the vector inability of these species to transmit T. cruzi II. Future proteomic and transcriptomic studies on vectors and the interactions of the intestinal microbiota with parasites will help to confirm the determinants of successful or failed vector transmission of T. cruzi DTUs in different parts of the Western Hemisphere.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/462e35377bcccb65ebbb8740ed4236596024b147,462e35377bcccb65ebbb8740ed4236596024b147,"Hamilton J.

Mapping the Silent Threat: A Comprehensive Analysis of Chagas Disease Occurrence in Riverside Communities in the Western Amazon,"Chagas disease (CD) is a typical tropical illness caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of Chagas disease in communities in two states of the Brazilian Amazon. Data collection occurred in July in the Alto Juruá region of Acre and in December in the communities of Humaitá, Amazonas, in 2019. A total of 477 participants were included in the study. In the communities of Alto Juruá, triatomine collections and analyses of T. cruzi infection were also carried out. All confirmed cases were found in the state of Acre, resulting in a total prevalence of 1.67. Of these eight cases, seven underwent ECG, all of which were concluded as normal by the physician team’s cardiologists. Seventeen triatomine bugs, all belonging to the Rhodnius genus, were captured. The natural infection rate by T. cruzi was 25% in the Nova Cintra community and 66.67% in the Boca do Moa community (Alto Juruá). This research found that more than 1% of the studied population exhibited positive serological results for Chagas disease in the riverine communities during the study period, representing a small portion of cases among those who have not yet been diagnosed.",2024,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d6648e6d3a53f95a1ee3c9fa60f74b8e2b4c32dc,d6648e6d3a53f95a1ee3c9fa60f74b8e2b4c32dc,"Daniela da Silva Paixão, Fernanda Portela Madeira, Adila Costa de Jesus, Hêmilly Caroline da Silva Paixão, Juliana de Souza Almeida Aranha Camargo, Mariane Albuquerque Lima Ribeiro, Leandro José Ramos, J. de Oliveira, João Aristeu da Rosa, P.

"Development of an operational trap for collection, killing, and preservation of triatomines (Hemiptera: Reduviidae): the kissing bug kill trap.","Surveillance of triatomines or kissing bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae), the insect vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, a Chagas disease agent, is hindered by the lack of an effective trap. To develop a kissing bug trap, we made iterative improvements over 3 years on a basic design resulting in 7 trap prototypes deployed across field sites in Texas, United States and Northern Mexico, yielding the capture of 325 triatomines of 4 species (Triatoma gerstaeckeri [Stål], T. sanguisuga [LeConte], T. neotomae [Neiva], and T. rubida [Uhler]). We began in 2019 with vertical transparent tarpaulin panel traps illuminated with artificial light powered by AC current, which were successful in autonomous trapping of flying triatomines, but were expensive, labor-intensive, and fragile. In 2020, we switched to white LED lights powered by a solar cell. We tested a scaled-down version of the vertical panel traps, a commercial cross-vane trap, and a multiple-funnel trap. The multiple-funnel traps captured 2.6× more kissing bugs per trap-day than cross-vane traps and approached the performance of the vertical panel traps in number of triatomines captured, number of triatomines per trap-day and triatomines per arthropod bycatch. Multiple-funnel traps required the least labor, were more durable, and had the highest triatomines per day per cost. Propylene glycol in the collection cups effectively preserved captured triatomines allowing for molecular detection of T. cruzi. The trapping experiments established dispersal patterns for the captured species. We conclude that multiple-funnel traps with solar-powered LED lights should be considered for adoption as surveillance and potentially mass-trapping management tools for triatomines.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10af029b798c2ddd43c09cd8da532aa65fc358b0,10af029b798c2ddd43c09cd8da532aa65fc358b0,"G.
