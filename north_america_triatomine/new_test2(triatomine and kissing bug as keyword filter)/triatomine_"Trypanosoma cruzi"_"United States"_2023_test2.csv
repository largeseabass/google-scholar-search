The distribution of triatomine (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in Illinois and Missouri: historical records and specimen submissions from community science programs.,"Triatomine species (kissing bugs) infected with Trypanosoma cruzi are found across the southern United States. The northern limits of Trypanosoma cruzi infected kissing bugs are less understood. The objective of this work was to describe the locations of kissing bugs from Illinois and Missouri based on historical records, submissions to Texas A&M University's (TAMU) Kissing Bug Community Science Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and records from online platforms (iNaturalist, BugGuide, and GBIF) up to and including 2022. A total of 228 records were discovered, including 186 from historical or observation platforms and 42 specimens submitted to TAMU or CDC. Species included Triatoma sanguisuga (221 total records, 9 nymphs) and Triatoma lecticularia (7 records). Notably, nearly all (24/26) records submitted to TAMU were collected indoors. Twelve of the 30 (40%) specimens tested were positive for the presence of T. cruzi, including parasite discrete taxonomic units TcI and TcIV. One triatomine sample had been found in a bed feeding on the submitter; this bug was positive for T. cruzi and had evidence of human blood in its gut. Records suggest a ubiquitous distribution in Missouri and potentially to the northernmost border in Illinois. Further investigations into triatomine distribution and infection status are needed within states assumed to be northern limits in order to create public health and veterinary health messaging and baseline distributional maps from which to measure future range shifts in relation to a changing climate.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26c765439f3ffb2a1f84d0a00d82100d54b09b8f,26c765439f3ffb2a1f84d0a00d82100d54b09b8f,"Ellen M.

Characterization of Latin American migrants at risk for Trypanosoma cruzi infection in a non-endemic setting. Insights into initial evaluation of cardiac and digestive involvement,"Background Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease (CD), a potentially fatal disease characterized by cardiac disorders and digestive, neurological or mixed alterations. T. cruzi is transmitted to humans by the bite of triatomine vectors; both the parasite and disease are endemic in Latin America and the United States. In the last decades, population migration has changed the classic epidemiology of T. cruzi, contributing to its global spread to traditionally non-endemic countries. Screening is recommended for Latin American populations residing in non-endemic countries. Methods The present study analyzes the epidemiological characteristics of 2,820 Latin American individuals who attended the International Health Service (IHS) of the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona between 2002 and 2019. The initial assessment of organ damage among positive cases of T. cruzi infection was analyzed, including the results of electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, barium enema and esophagogram. Results Among all the screened individuals attending the clinic, 2,441 (86.6%) were born in Bolivia and 1,993 (70.7%) were female. Of individuals, 1,517 (81.5%) reported previous exposure to the vector, which is a strong risk factor associated with T. cruzi infection; 1,382 individuals were positive for T. cruzi infection. The first evaluation of individuals with confirmed T. cruzi infection, showed 148 (17.1%) individuals with Chagasic cardiomyopathy, the main diagnostic method being an ECG and the right bundle branch block (RBBB) for the most frequent disorder; 16 (10.8%) individuals had a normal ECG and were diagnosed of Chagasic cardiomyopathy by echocardiogram. Conclusions We still observe many Latin American individuals who were at risk of T. cruzi infection in highly endemic areas in their countries of origin, and who have not been previously tested for T. cruzi infection. In fact, even in Spain, a country with one of the highest proportion of diagnosis of Latin American populations, T. cruzi infection remains underdiagnosed. The screening of Latin American populations presenting with a similar profile as reported here should be promoted. ECG is considered necessary to assess Chagasic cardiomyopathy in positive individuals, but echocardiograms should also be considered as a diagnostic approach given that it can detect cardiac abnormalities when the ECG is normal.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63bada597d0219b567079b6ca196e1962c0873f1,63bada597d0219b567079b6ca196e1962c0873f1,"Pedro Laynez-Roldán, Irene Losada-Galván, Elizabeth J Posada, Leonardo de la Torre Ávila, A.

"Collection of triatomines from sylvatic habitats by a Trypanosoma cruzi-infected scent detection dog in Texas, USA","Background Triatomine insects, vectors of the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), are challenging to locate in sylvatic habitats. Collection techniques used in the United States often rely on methods to intercept seasonally dispersing adults or on community scientists’ encounters. Neither method is suited for detecting nest habitats likely to harbor triatomines, which is important for vector surveillance and control. Furthermore, manual inspection of suspected harborages is difficult and unlikely to reveal novel locations and host associations. Similar to a team that used a trained dog to detect sylvatic triatomines in Paraguay, we worked with a trained scent detection dog to detect triatomines in sylvatic locations across Texas. Principle methodology/Findings Ziza, a 3-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer previously naturally infected with T. cruzi, was trained to detect triatomines. Over the course of 6 weeks in the fall of 2017, the dog and her handler searched at 17 sites across Texas. The dog detected 60 triatomines at 6 sites; an additional 50 triatomines were contemporaneously collected at 1 of these sites and 2 additional sites without the assistance of the dog. Approximately 0.98 triatomines per hour were found when only humans were conducting searches; when working with the dog, approximately 1.71 triatomines per hour were found. In total, 3 adults and 107 nymphs of four species (Triatoma gerstaeckeri, Triatoma protracta, Triatoma sanguisuga, and Triatoma indictiva) were collected. PCR testing of a subset revealed T. cruzi infection, including DTUs TcI and TcIV, in 27% of nymphs (n = 103) and 66% of adults (n = 3). Bloodmeal analysis of a subset of triatomines (n = 5) revealed feeding on Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus), and eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus). Conclusion/Significance A trained scent detection dog enhanced triatomine detections in sylvatic habitats. This approach is effective at detecting nidicolous triatomines. Control of sylvatic sources of triatomines is challenging, but this new knowledge of specific sylvatic habitats and key hosts may reveal opportunities for novel vector control methods to block the transmission of T. cruzi to humans and domestic animals.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63efdda6fef9eece724a101a045d62d868d0977d,63efdda6fef9eece724a101a045d62d868d0977d,"Devin M.

Validation of a multiplex microsphere immunoassay for detection of antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi in dogs,"The vector-borne protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease in humans, dogs, and many other mammalian hosts. Canine Chagas disease is increasingly diagnosed in dogs of the southern United States where triatomine insect vectors occur, and there are limited veterinary testing options; only the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test is offered at a single accredited diagnostic laboratory. We evaluated a multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MIA) for the detection of antibodies against T. cruzi in dogs and compared it with existing serologic methods to establish cutoff values and relative sensitivity and specificity. We tested 135 canine sera that had been characterized using the IFA and off-label use of 2 commercial rapid assays with our multiplex MIA against 12 antigens: 9 T. cruzi antigens, a negative control recombinant protein (green fluorescent protein, GFP), a Leishmania antigen, and a canine parvovirus antigen (used as an antibody control given near-ubiquitous parvoviral vaccination). The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) ratio between each T. cruzi antigen and GFP was calculated for every sample. Samples with an antigen:GFP MFI ratio > 4 SDs above the mean of 25 known-negative sera were considered positive to that antigen. Samples testing positive to ≥ 2 antigens were considered positive for T. cruzi antibodies. Compared to the IFA, our multiplex MIA had a relative sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97.0%. Given its precision, high-throughput format, potential for automation, and lack of subjective interpretation, our multiplex MIA should be considered a valid and improved assay for T. cruzi antibodies in dogs.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d5f9d532cd842f1826206dfc522ecee3a064ae8,7d5f9d532cd842f1826206dfc522ecee3a064ae8,"Carlos A.

"Prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi, the Etiologic Agent of Chagas Disease, Infection in Texas Skunks (Mammalia: Mephitidae).","Background: Chagas disease is one of the world's most neglected tropical diseases, infecting over six million people across the Americas. The hemoparasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent for the disease, circulating in domestic, peridomestic, and sylvatic transmission cycles that are maintained by triatomine vectors and a diversity of wild and synanthropic hosts. Public health and wildlife management interventions targeting the interruption of T. cruzi transmission rely on an understanding of the dynamics driving the ecology of this zoonotic pathogen. One wildlife host that purportedly plays a role in the transmission of Chagas disease within the southern United States is the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), although infection prevalence in this species is poorly understood. Materials and Methods: To this end, we conducted a PCR-based surveillance of T. cruzi in 235 wild skunks, representing 4 species, across 76 counties and 10 ecoregions in Texas, United States, along with an evaluation of risk factors associated with the infection. Results: We recovered an overall T. cruzi prevalence of 17.9% for all mephitid taxa aggregated, ranging between 6.7% for plains spotted skunks (Spilogale putorius interrupta) and 42.9% for western spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis). We report the first cases of T. cruzi infection in plains spotted and American hog-nosed skunks (Conepatus leuconotus), of important note for conservation medicine since populations of both species are declining within Texas. Although not statistically significant, we also detected trends for juveniles to exhibit greater infection risk than adults and for differential sex biases in T. cruzi prevalence between taxa, which align with variations in species-specific seasonal activity patterns. No geographic or taxonomic risk factors were identified. Conclusion: Our study contributed key data for population viability analyses and epidemiologic models in addition to providing a baseline for future T. cruzi surveillance among skunks and other wildlife species.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c253b02df938be5b4cac1060dcbf363573b69e1a,c253b02df938be5b4cac1060dcbf363573b69e1a,"Bonnie E Gulas-Wroblewski, Rodion Gorchakov, Rebecca B Kairis, R.

Chagas Disease,"Chagas disease, which is caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a leading neglected tropical disease in the United States. An estimated 240 000 to 350 000 persons in the United States are infected, primarily immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and South America, where the disease is endemic. The parasite is transmitted by the triatomine bug but can also be passed through blood transfusion, via organ transplant, or congenitally. Approximately 30% of infected persons later develop cardiac and/or gastrointestinal complications. Health care providers should consider screening at-risk patients with serologic testing. Early diagnosis and treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox can help prevent complications.",2023,12,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f06a9ee8668674184acd43a6f3b4dc1780387bbd,f06a9ee8668674184acd43a6f3b4dc1780387bbd,"N.

Comparative proteomic analysis of the hemolymph and salivary glands of Rhodnius prolixus and R. colombiensis reveals candidates associated with differential lytic activity against Trypanosoma cruzi I and T. cruzi II,"Background Immune response of triatomines plays an important role in the success or failure of transmission of T. cruzi. Studies on parasite–vector interaction have shown the presence of trypanolytic factors and have been observed to be differentially expressed among triatomines, which affects the transmission of some T. cruzi strains or DTUs (Discrete Typing Units). Methodology/Principal Findings Trypanolytic factors were detected in the hemolymph and saliva of R. prolixus against epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of T. cruzi II. To identify the components of the immune response that could be involved in this lytic activity, a comparative proteomic analysis was carried out, detecting 120 proteins in the hemolymph of R. prolixus and 107 in R. colombiensis. In salivary glands, 1103 proteins were detected in R. prolixus and 853 in R. colombiensis. A higher relative abundance of lysozyme, prolixin, nitrophorins, and serpin as immune response proteins was detected in the hemolymph of R. prolixus. Among the R. prolixus salivary proteins, a higher relative abundance of nitrophorins, lipocalins, and triabins was detected. The higher relative abundance of these immune factors in R. prolixus supports their participation in the lytic activity on T. cruzi II, but not on T. cruzi I, which is resistant to lysis by hemolymph and salivary proteins of R. prolixus due to mechanisms of evading oxidative stress caused by immune factors. Conclusions/Significance T. cruzi I is a DTU distributed from the southern United States to the center of Chile and Argentina, and its successful spread across this range could be related to resistance to oxidative stress in vectors. Future proteomic and transcriptomic studies on vectors and the interactions of the intestinal microbiota with parasites will help to confirm the determinants of successful or failed vector transmission of T. cruzi DTUs in different parts of the Western Hemisphere. Author summary Some factors can facilitate or prevent T. cruzi transmission, i.e. vector immunity. Our work has managed to detect a stronger immune response against T. cruzi II in R. prolixus saliva and haemolymph, compared to that of R. colombiensis. Proteins from both species’ saliva and haemolymph were analysed for studying factors which might have been involved in such response; most proteins were detected in both species’ haemolymph, thereby indicating common immune mechanisms. Three proteins having oxidative immune activity were only expressed in R. prolixus. Lipocalin diversity and abundance predominated in R. prolixus saliva; these proteins are involved in nitric oxide metabolism and their role in immunity could be key in host defence against T. cruzi. Recognising the components modulating parasite transmission in a vector helps in understanding how such factors act independently and how they would act synergistically against T. cruzi, thereby enabling us to establish tools regarding Chaga’s disease epidemiology, aimed at predicting T. cruzi distribution and creating transmission control mechanisms.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f1c910ba8d1dbb8b8269b5411c79eb586b064b7c,f1c910ba8d1dbb8b8269b5411c79eb586b064b7c,"Hamilton J.

Parasites: The Inside Story,"P The Inside Story shows how parasites coexisted and spread around the world through host migration, particularly through humans, and researches their origin and evolution. The book describes how the choice of host has affected the successful survival of some parasites and avoidance of extinction. The authors show how parasites influence and manipulate their intermediate host, which makes them more visible and easier prey for the next host, causing the host to “look foolish.” The authors use novel and entertaining approaches to explore their subject, such as describing how the Israelite Jonah spent 3 days in the belly of a whale and what parasites he might have encountered during that 3-day stay. Another entertaining approach was participation in the parasite Olympics, where parasites earned medals according to their success and survival by choosing and adjusting to their hosts. Ascaris lumbricoides is a gold medal winner as one of the most durable internal parasites of humans. However, the book overlooked Strongyloides stercoralis, which can cause hyperinfection syndrome in immunocompromised hosts and is considered an emerging infectious disease and deserves an honorary Olympic medal. Babesiosis is another notable emerging parasitic disease that was overlooked. I appreciated the novel and appealing way in which the authors show how parasites affect other species and human lives, while also incorporating their nonharmful roles, as in the case of mutualism and commensalism. I loved the immense and vivid imagery used to describe the breathtaking basin of the Congo River but was saddened that many persons living along the river might not continue to see that beautiful scenery because of river blindness caused by Onchocerca volvulus. The stories, connections to real persons, and references to at least 3 movies and 1 television series indicate the detailed efforts involved in writing this book. The book has a high level of scientific detail as it dives into history, ecology, evolution, and future outlooks. The authors discuss how climate change is affecting parasite existence. An example is the migration of triatomine kissing bugs to the southern half of the United States, which might increase the risk for Trypanosoma cruzi transmission, causing Chagas disease (to which the book attributes Charles Darwin’s death, from an infection he acquired during a trip to South America). The authors also elaborate on international scientific collaboration during epidemiologic investigations, such as the collaboration between researchers from the United States and Mongolia during a hantavirus infection outbreak in New Mexico. Readers will learn about parasite eradication campaigns, some of which did not turn out well, as was the case for the Schistosoma mansoni eradication campaign in Egypt that resulted in populationwide infections with hepatitis C virus. The book has 29 color photos, making the stories only more vibrant, and helps in understanding parasite life cycles and in making diagnoses. This book will appeal to readers interested in emerging infectious diseases, nonparasitologists, scientists, and clinicians and is an admirable expedition into the amazing world of parasites.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4654f475630f38b150a637624817a85787cadf79,4654f475630f38b150a637624817a85787cadf79,Rezhan H.
