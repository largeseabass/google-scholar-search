"Characteristics and Adverse Events of Patients for Whom Nifurtimox Was Released Through CDC-Sponsored Investigational New Drug Program for Treatment of Chagas Disease — United States, 2001–2021","Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Chagas disease is endemic in rural areas of Latin America, but T. cruzi, triatomine vectors, infected mammalian reservoir hosts, and rare cases of autochthonous vector borne transmission have been reported in the United States (1). Possible modes of transmission include the following: vector borne via skin or mucosal contact with feces of infected triatomine bugs, congenital, blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or laboratory accident. Chagas disease can be treated with benznidazole (commercially available since May 14, 2018) or nifurtimox (2). Before January 25, 2021, nifurtimox (Lampit) had been exclusively available through CDC under an Institutional Review Board-approved Investigational New Drug (IND) treatment protocol, at which time it became reasonably accessible to health care providers outside of the program. This report summarizes CDC Drug Service reports for selected characteristics of and adverse events reported by 336 patients for whom nifurtimox was requested under the CDC IND program during January 1, 2001-January 25, 2021. Of the 336 patients, 34.2% resided in California. Median age of patients was 37 years (range = 1-78 years). Most patients were aged ≥18 (91.8%; 305 of 332) and Hispanic (93.2%; 290 of 311). Among the patients with available information, 91.4% (222 of 243) reported an adverse event. Among those with information about the severity of their adverse events, 20.5% reported a severe event. On August 7, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced approval of a nifurtimox product, Lampit (Bayer), for treatment of Chagas disease in patients aged <18 years weighing ≥5.5 lbs (≥2.5 kg). Lampit became commercially available during October 2020. Physicians should take frequency of adverse events into consideration when prescribing nifurtimox and counseling patients.",2022,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a55ede925b8e264e30ae1c99a141387a3f839976,a55ede925b8e264e30ae1c99a141387a3f839976,"Andrew Abbott, S.

"Southwestern national park service employee risk, knowledge, and concern for triatomine exposure: A qualitative analysis using a novel knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey","Chagas disease (CD), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected parasitic infection in the United States (US). In the Southwestern US, National Park Service (NPS) employees are a unique population with potential exposure to CD. This population lives in close contact with several species of sylvatic triatomine bugs, the vectors of T. cruzi, that may enter residential buildings at night. Despite the higher potential risk of CD transmission for southwestern NPS employees, the socio-cultural factors that impact autochthonous CD transmission in the US remain unknown. To address this gap, we investigated how NPS employee knowledge and attitudes impact their triatomine preventive behaviors. We distributed a 42-item online questionnaire to NPS employees at four national parks in Arizona and Texas. We detected high self-reported bite exposure in NPS housing, despite moderate- to high-frequency of prevention behaviors. Specific behaviors, such as often or always repairing window screens, were associated with a decreased risk of putative triatomine bug exposure. Additionally, NPS employees had low knowledge of CD. For those with greater knowledge of CD, it was not associated with increased frequency of prevention behavior. We found that increased CD anxiety was associated with increased personal agency to reduce the risk of CD. These results demonstrate the influence of knowledge and attitudes regarding CD on triatomine prevention behavior within a potential high-risk population in the US, and the importance of utilizing strategies beyond provision of education to influence behaviors.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73f6e701cf4b79b5902c50c09d9af53efb2e46d6,73f6e701cf4b79b5902c50c09d9af53efb2e46d6,"Antonio Alvarado, Emily M.

"Collection of triatomines from sylvatic habitats by a Chagas-positive, trained scent-detection canine in Texas, USA","Background Triatomine insects, vectors of the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), are challenging to locate in sylvatic habitats. Collection techniques used in the United States often rely on methods to intercept seasonally dispersing adults or on community scientists’ encounters. Neither method is suited for detecting nidicolous habitats, which is important for vector control. Furthermore, manual inspection of suspected harborages is unlikely to reveal novel locations and host associations. Similar to a team that used a trained dog to detect sylvatic triatomines in Paraguay, we worked with a trained scent detection dog to detect sylvatic locations of triatomines across Texas. Principle methodology/Findings Ziza, a 3-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer previously naturally infected with T. cruzi, was trained to detect triatomines. Over the course of 6 weeks in the fall of 2017, the dog and her handler visited 18 sites across Texas. The dog detected 60 triatomines at 7 locations; an additional 50 triatomines were contemporaneously collected at these sites without the assistance of the dog. Approximately 0.98 triatomines per hour were found when only humans were conducting searches; when working with the dog, approximately 1.71 triatomines per hour were found. In total, 3 adults and 107 nymphs of four species (Triatoma gerstaeckeri, Triatoma protracta, Triatoma sanguisuga, and Triatoma indictiva) were collected. PCR testing of a subset revealed T. cruzi infection, including DTUs TcI and TcIV, in 28% of nymphs (n=100) and 66% of adults (n=3). Blood meal analysis of a subset of triatomines (n=5) revealed feeding on Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus) and eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus). Conclusion/Significance A trained scent detection dog enhanced triatomine detections in sylvatic habitats. This approach is especially effective at detecting triatomine nymphs and nidicolous locations. With new knowledge of specific sylvatic habitats and key hosts fed upon by triatomines, there are opportunities for continued exploration of novel vector control methods to block the transmission of T. cruzi to humans and domestic animals. Author summary Triatomine insects, also known as ‘kissing bugs,’ are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease in humans, dogs, and other mammals. Triatomines are found throughout the Americas, but little is known about where these blood-sucking insects spend their early life stages. Knowing more is important to vector control initiatives aimed at interrupting Chagas disease transmission. Scent detection dogs have been trained to detect many pests, including one study of a triatomine detection dog in South America. In this study, we used a dog to detect triatomines in their natural environments throughout Texas. Over 6 weeks, the dog identified 60 triatomines at 7 different locations; an additional 50 triatomines were collected without the dog’s assistance. Nearly twice as many triatomines were collected per hour when the dog was searching as compared to only humans searching. Of all the triatomine nymphs collected, 28% were positive for T. cruzi, and the blood meal analysis revealed kissing bugs had fed on Southern plains woodrat, opossum, and eastern cottontail. This study outlines a strategy that can be replicated in the United States to enhance the detection and control of habitats where triatomines spend their early life stages.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/81653bf4e4d8fbc558f1477075736402f279760a,81653bf4e4d8fbc558f1477075736402f279760a,"Devin M.

"Identification of the parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, in multiple tissues of epidemiological significance in the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana): Implications for environmental and vertical transmission routes","Background Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasitic protozoan, is endemic to the Americas and the causative agent of Chagas disease in humans. In South America, opossums facilitate transmission via infected anal gland secretions in addition to transmission via triatomine vectors. In North America, the Virginia opossum is a reservoir host for the parasite with transmission routes that are not clearly defined. The unique biology of this marsupial provides the opportunity to investigate vertical transmission in this wildlife species in situ. Our objectives were to investigate alternative routes of transmission that may facilitate spillover into other species and to determine if vertical transmission was evident. Methodology/Principal findings Virginia opossums were sampled at 10 trapping locations over a 10-month period in a 5-county region of north central Florida. Peripheral blood, fecal swabs, and anal gland secretions were collected from each adult individual, and peripheral blood was collected from joey opossums. Total DNA was extracted from each collected sample type, and T. cruzi infected individuals and the infecting Discrete Typing Unit (DTU) were identified using real time PCR methods. Adult Virginia opossums (n = 112) were infected with T. cruzi (51.8%, 95% CI [42.6–60.8%]) throughout the sampled period and at each location. T. cruzi DNA was found in each of the three biological sample types. Vertical transmission of T. cruzi was inferred in one litter of mother-dependent (n = 20, 5.0%, 95% CI [0.9–23.6%]) joey opossums where 2 joeys from this same litter were rtPCR positive for T. cruzi. Conclusions/Significance We inferred vertical transmission from mother to neonate which may serve to amplify the prevalence of T. cruzi in adult Virginia opossums. T. cruzi DNA was detected in the anal gland secretions of Virginia opossums. Infected anal gland secretions suggest a possible environmental route of transmission for T. cruzi via the deposition of contaminated feces and spraint at wildlife latrines. Only DTU1 was identified in the sampled population which is consistent with human autochthonous cases in the United States.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4c2c8021db84262f54ccfc168adab67c239f4481,4c2c8021db84262f54ccfc168adab67c239f4481,"Carson W.

Chagas Disease Expands Its Epidemiological Frontiers From Rural to Urban Areas,"The infection with the hemoflagellate parasite Trypanosoma cruzi originates from America where the wildlife cycle remains to alternate between mammals and hematophagous triatomines. Transmission through contamination of the bite site by vector feces containing highly infectious forms of parasite or direct ingestion of T. cruzi-infected triatomines appear to be the dominant transmission mechanisms. Man joins the transmission when he enters this wild environment or takes the leaves of palms carrying vectors to build houses. Rural Chagas disease develops associated with populations of low economic resources, with infection and reinfection of vector bites since childhood, and the consequent evolution toward chronic cases in adults, when there is little therapeutic benefit to infected people. The progressive migration of people from rural to urban areas and the adaptation of vectors to the peripheries of cities due to displacement caused by deforestation or urbanization that has favored the presence of enzootic cycles with Panstrongylus geniculatus as the most widely distributed species and mammals (synanthropic and domestic) allow vector transmission by ingestion of food contaminated with excrements containing infectious trypomastigotes as the dominant transmission mechanism in the urban environment. Human-to-human transmissions through vertical mother–child infection, transfusions, organ transplants, and the possibility of sexual transmission, transform the epidemiology and the clinical evolution of Chagas disease in the urban environment. Vectors of American trypanosomiasis are no longer restricted to the endemic area, but its presence has been demonstrated in nonendemic areas of the United States, Asia, and other latitudes. The worldwide plague of bedbugs (Cimex lectularius) threatens the possibility of expansion of transmission since they are vectors susceptible to infection, transmission to mammals, trans-stadial penetration, and not being affected by T. cruzi infection at least experimentally. These factors, added to the presence of an unknown number of migrating Latin American asymptomatic carriers together with the presence of triatomines in other continents, have initiated the globalization of a pathology originating in the American continent. Only with an integrative approach, based on new and better tolerated and efficient drugs, vaccines and residual action insecticides, all of them included in an epidemiological surveillance program.",2022,6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/90205472a4d823fdb813ab53ac285da2c1d15fcc,90205472a4d823fdb813ab53ac285da2c1d15fcc,"B.
