"Identification of a triatomine infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in an urban area of the state of Veracruz, Mexico: A comprehensive study","Chagas disease, considered a neglected disease, was initially confined to rural localities in endemic areas; however, in recent years through the process of urbanization and migration of infected people, the disease is gaining importance in urban environments. The presence of the vector in urban areas in most cases is due to the passive transport of vectors, but recently, its presence seems to be linked to vector adaptation processes associated with climate change. This paper reports the occurrence of an infected triatomine in the peridomicile of a house in an urban area of Córdoba, Veracruz, Mexico, where the species found is described, the molecular characteristics and resistance to BZN and NFX of the Trypanosoma cruzi isolate obtained, as well as serological data of the dwelling inhabitants. These urban disease scenarios make it possible to generate new scientific knowledge and enable the creation of new control strategies for Chagas disease vectors.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d5e1a6694ace87a189e007c4139f19f39f3546b,3d5e1a6694ace87a189e007c4139f19f39f3546b,"Ochoa-Martínez Paulina, López-Monteon Aracely, López-Domínguez Jaime, Torres-Montero Jesús, Domínguez-Guillén Jorge Alberto, Ramos-Ligonio Angel"
"First Report of Eratyrus cuspidatus (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) Infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in Peridomestic Environment in Chiapas, Mexico.","Background: Triatomine bugs are natural vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis. The role of sylvatic triatomine species as vectors of T. cruzi in Mexico remains to be fully understood. Our research on the epidemiology of Chagas disease in Southeastern Mexico involved sampling triatomines in rural settings. Materials and Methods: A triatomine was collected in a peridomestic environment of a rural dwelling in the state of Chiapas. The triatomine was identified morphologically as an adult female Eratyrus cuspidatus Stal. Results: Microscopic analysis revealed flagellate forms of T. cruzi in the feces of the E. cuspidatus collected. This was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Amplification of the mini-exon gene showed that the T. cruzi infecting E. cuspidatus corresponded to lineage I. Conclusions: This is the first report from Mexico of E. cuspidatus found infected in a human dwelling, which represents an important adaptation process to inhabit human environments.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/200bcf413427bf401239ce932ccb56b8dbdc05ec,200bcf413427bf401239ce932ccb56b8dbdc05ec,"D.

Infection with Trypanosoma Cruzi Chagas and Characterization of Human Habitats of Triatoma Picturata (Usinger) in Western Mexico,"ABSTRACT: Chagas disease is one of the most important vector-borne diseases in Latin America. Triatoma picturata (Usinger), distributed in western Mexico, is one of the most important vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas. Knowing the type and materials used for building homes could lead to improved methods for controlling triatomines by focusing efforts on controlling every species of triatomine in its specific microhabitat. Houses in three studied localities of western Mexico that harbored T. picturata were characterized, as well as two entomological indices. Infestation Index values varied from 10.8% to 51.9% in the three localities, whereas Natural Infection Index values varied from 18.1% to 35.2%. Characteristics of houses invaded by T. picturata also varied. In Juan Gil Preciado, with the highest Entomological Index values, most houses were built of adobe walls with a roof of clay tiles and a dirt floor, and included the presence of domestic animals. Our data indicate that the potential risk of infection with T. cruzi differs markedly for inhabitants of the three studied localities, which demonstrates the importance of studying local populations of triatomines. Our study should contribute to decision-making regarding triatomine control efforts by providing profiles of houses that are more susceptible to triatomine invasion.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b192815a59d10c225cece8523d79d11044d83e1b,b192815a59d10c225cece8523d79d11044d83e1b,"T.

"New Records of Triatomine: Triatoma rubida and T. sinaloensis at Sonora, Northwestern Mexico","Abstract. To update a list of arthropod group-species, including triatomines, in the State of Sonora, northwestern Mexico, entomological surveys were done during the spring of 2022 in conserved areas of the state. Triatomines Triatoma rubida (Uhler) and T. sinaloensis Ryckman (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) were found living in nests of woodrats, Neotoma sp., and California roadrunners, Geococcyx californianus (Lesson). Because T. rubida is one of the main vectors of Chagas disease in North America, and T. sinaloensis has been found naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, surveillance of the species should be essential for Chagas disease control programs in northwestern Mexico.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e054bbba65d8e23aed661388f95226fe86e25d4,3e054bbba65d8e23aed661388f95226fe86e25d4,"Antonio A.

"Chagas Disease, a Triatomine Bug-Transmitted Protozoan Infection","Chagas disease is a potentially fatal, chronic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan parasite. It causes 6 to 8 million cases and 50,000 deaths each year. Humans and animals usually become infected with T. cruzi via triatomine bugs, also called kissing or conenose bugs, found only in the Americas. Disease transmitted by triatomine bugs generally occurs in rural areas of Mexico, Central America, and South America, but it is becoming more prevalent in non-endemic areas like the US as asymptomatic infected people move from rural to urban areas of Latin America and other regions.  In the US, approximately 300,000 people are currently infected with Chagas disease, 18,000 in Florida. Most if not all of them were infected elsewhere; local transmission of Chagas disease via triatomines in the US is rare. Awareness and understanding of Chagas disease are critical to detect and treat cases early. This publication is intended for anyone interested in learning more about Chagas disease.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c936b4ef3fd874af4ee71427408b470a8c35ba9b,c936b4ef3fd874af4ee71427408b470a8c35ba9b,"Bethany R.

Chagas Disease,"Chagas disease, which is caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a leading neglected tropical disease in the United States. An estimated 240 000 to 350 000 persons in the United States are infected, primarily immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and South America, where the disease is endemic. The parasite is transmitted by the triatomine bug but can also be passed through blood transfusion, via organ transplant, or congenitally. Approximately 30% of infected persons later develop cardiac and/or gastrointestinal complications. Health care providers should consider screening at-risk patients with serologic testing. Early diagnosis and treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox can help prevent complications.",2023,10,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f06a9ee8668674184acd43a6f3b4dc1780387bbd,f06a9ee8668674184acd43a6f3b4dc1780387bbd,"N.

"Chagas Disease, A Review of the Literature","Chagas disease is a vector-borne (triatomine) infection caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Synonyms for this disease are: American trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease and T. cruzi infection. 10, 5 The most common form of transmission of Chagas disease is through hematophagous triatomine insects (triatominae), which develop in dwellings in precarious conditions, The disease can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, organ transplantation, oral and congenital routes, and even more rarely by exceptional routes such as sexual contact and non-Triatominae vectors. American Trypanosomiasis is endemic in much of Mexico, Central and South America 1,11. it is estimated that ~6 million individuals are infected throughout Latin America, while ~300,000 are infected in the U.S.1, 10, 11,16 Chagas disease has two clearly differentiated phases. Initially, the acute phase lasts about two months after infection, they may have a skin lesion or a purplish swelling of an eyelid, they may have fever, headache, enlarged lymph nodes, pallor, muscle aches, shortness of breath, swelling, and abdominal or chest pain. During the chronic phase, the infection can cause sudden death due to cardiac arrhythmias or progressive heart failure due to destruction of the cardiac muscle and its innervations. 15 Appropriate diagnostics for acute infection, nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) from blood is recommended; For chronic infection, serological testing is employed. Antitrypanosomal agents, benznidazole and nifurtimox, have shown efficacy in treating T. cruzi infection, The most serious complication is chronic chagasic heart disease, since it is the main cause of death in sick patients. 16",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02a92ce74e01835ca926db4cf45a006f0e26ac5f,02a92ce74e01835ca926db4cf45a006f0e26ac5f,"Karen Denis Gómez Arciniega, Ramsés Erwin López Castellón"
Crossing experiments detect partial reproductive isolation among populations of Triatoma longipennis (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae).,"Chagas disease is an important vector-borne disease endemic in Mexico. Of the 33 triatomine species found in Mexico, Triatoma longipennis (Usinger) is considered among the most important because of its infection indices, capacity for transmitting Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas), and its distribution areas. Here, we describe the results of a reproductive isolation analysis among 5 populations of T. longipennis collected from representative areas of Mexico. Fertility and segregation of morphological characteristics were examined in two generations of hybrids. The percentage of pairs with (fertile) offspring varied from 30% to 100% in the parental crosses, while these values varied from 0 to 100% in the intersite crosses. Our results indicate partial reproductive isolation among these populations.

The distribution of triatomine (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in Illinois and Missouri: historical records and specimen submissions from community science programs.,"Triatomine species (kissing bugs) infected with Trypanosoma cruzi are found across the southern United States. The northern limits of Trypanosoma cruzi infected kissing bugs are less understood. The objective of this work was to describe the locations of kissing bugs from Illinois and Missouri based on historical records, submissions to Texas A&M University's (TAMU) Kissing Bug Community Science Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and records from online platforms (iNaturalist, BugGuide, and GBIF) up to and including 2022. A total of 228 records were discovered, including 186 from historical or observation platforms and 42 specimens submitted to TAMU or CDC. Species included Triatoma sanguisuga (221 total records, 9 nymphs) and Triatoma lecticularia (7 records). Notably, nearly all (24/26) records submitted to TAMU were collected indoors. Twelve of the 30 (40%) specimens tested were positive for the presence of T. cruzi, including parasite discrete taxonomic units TcI and TcIV. One triatomine sample had been found in a bed feeding on the submitter; this bug was positive for T. cruzi and had evidence of human blood in its gut. Records suggest a ubiquitous distribution in Missouri and potentially to the northernmost border in Illinois. Further investigations into triatomine distribution and infection status are needed within states assumed to be northern limits in order to create public health and veterinary health messaging and baseline distributional maps from which to measure future range shifts in relation to a changing climate.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26c765439f3ffb2a1f84d0a00d82100d54b09b8f,26c765439f3ffb2a1f84d0a00d82100d54b09b8f,"Ellen M.

Dual localization of receptor-type adenylate cyclases and cAMP response protein 3 unveils the presence of two putative signaling microdomains in Trypanosoma cruzi,"ABSTRACT Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, a leading cause of disability and premature death in the Americas. This parasite spends its life between a triatomine insect and a mammalian host, transitioning between developmental stages in response to microenvironmental changes. Among the second messengers driving differentiation in T. cruzi, cAMP has been shown to mediate metacyclogenesis and response to osmotic stress, but this signaling pathway remains largely unexplored in this parasite. Adenylate cyclases (ACs) catalyze the conversion of ATP to cAMP. They comprise a multigene family encoding putative receptor-type ACs in T. cruzi. Using protein sequence alignment, we classified them into five groups and chose a representative member from each group to study their localization (TcAC1–TcAC5). We expressed an HA-tagged version of each protein in T. cruzi and performed immunofluorescence analysis. A peculiar dual localization of TcAC1 and TcAC2 was observed in the flagellar distal domain and in the contractile vacuole complex (CVC), and their enzymatic activity was confirmed by gene complementation in yeast. Furthermore, TcAC1 overexpressing parasites showed an increased metacyclogenesis, a defect in host cell invasion, and a reduced intracellular replication, highlighting the importance of this protein throughout T. cruzi life cycle. These mutants were more tolerant to hypoosmotic stress and showed a higher adhesion capacity during in vitro metacyclogenesis, whereas the wild-type phenotype was restored after disrupting TcAC1 localization. Finally, TcAC1 was found to interact with cAMP response protein 3 (TcCARP3), co-localizing with this protein in the flagellar tip and CVC. IMPORTANCE We identified three components of the cAMP signaling pathway (TcAC1, TcAC2, and TcCARP3) with dual localization in Trypanosoma cruzi: the flagellar distal domain and the CVC, structures involved in cell adhesion and osmoregulation, respectively. We found evidence on the role of TcAC1 in both cellular processes, as well as in metacyclogenesis. Our data suggest that TcACs act as signal sensors and transducers through cAMP synthesis in membrane microdomains. We propose a model in which TcACs sense the harsh conditions in the triatomine hindgut (nutrient deprivation, acidic pH, osmotic stress, ionic composition, hydrophobic interactions) and become active. Synthesis of cAMP then triggers cell adhesion prior completion of metacyclogenesis, while mediating a response to osmotic stress in the parasite. These results shed light into the mechanisms driving cAMP-mediated cell differentiation in T. cruzi, while raising new questions on the activation of TcACs and the role of downstream components of this pathway.

"Trypanosoma cruzi in Mexican Neotropical vectors and mammals: wildlife, livestock, pets, and human population.","OBJECTIVE
To provide primary evidence of Trypanosoma cruzi landscape genetics in the Mexican Neotropics.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trypanosoma cruzi and discrete typing units (DTU) prevalence were analyzed in landscape communities of vectors, wildlife, livestock, pets, and sympatric human populations using endpoint PCR and sequencing of all relevant amplicons from mitochondrial (kDNA) and nuclear (ME, 18S, 24Sα) gene markers.


RESULTS
Although 98% of the infected sample-set (N=2 963) contained single or mixed infections of DTUI (TcI, 96.2%) and TcVI (22.6%), TcIV and TcII were also identified. Sensitivity of individual markers varied and was dependent on host taxon; kDNA, ME and 18S combined identified 95% of infections. ME genotyped 90% of vector infections, but 60% of mammals (36% wildlife), while neither 18S nor 24Sα typed more than 20% of mammal infections.

"Trypanosoma cruzi Survey in Poached Pichis (Zaedyus pichiy; Mammalia, Cingulata) from Mendoza, Argentina","Abstract: The transmission cycles of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, include a wide variety of mammals and hematophagous triatomine insects. Infection with this blood parasite has been confirmed in many armadillo species; however, information on infection in Zaedyus pichiy, a small armadillo that inhabits areas endemic to Chagas disease, is scarce. Our objective was to determine the infection frequency and parasite load of T. cruzi in 49 wild Z. pichiy confiscated dead from poachers in Mendoza, Argentina, 2010–2017. We detected T. cruzi DNA in 32 of 49 armadillos (65%) using real-time PCR, confirming infection with T. cruzi in a high proportion of confiscated pichis. No differences were found related to sex, age, or ecoregion origin of the assessed pichis. Parasite loads ranged between <0.1 and 8.88 parasite equivalents/microgram cardiac tissue. Additional studies on the infection status of Z. pichiy are needed to determine their role in the maintenance of the sylvatic transmission cycle and the potential zoonotic risk from hunted pichis.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/752a0ee0c5da752710f5c49dfd8ed4a38f24021b,752a0ee0c5da752710f5c49dfd8ed4a38f24021b,"Melisa E.

"Collection of triatomines from sylvatic habitats by a Trypanosoma cruzi-infected scent detection dog in Texas, USA","Background Triatomine insects, vectors of the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), are challenging to locate in sylvatic habitats. Collection techniques used in the United States often rely on methods to intercept seasonally dispersing adults or on community scientists’ encounters. Neither method is suited for detecting nest habitats likely to harbor triatomines, which is important for vector surveillance and control. Furthermore, manual inspection of suspected harborages is difficult and unlikely to reveal novel locations and host associations. Similar to a team that used a trained dog to detect sylvatic triatomines in Paraguay, we worked with a trained scent detection dog to detect triatomines in sylvatic locations across Texas. Principle methodology/Findings Ziza, a 3-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer previously naturally infected with T. cruzi, was trained to detect triatomines. Over the course of 6 weeks in the fall of 2017, the dog and her handler searched at 17 sites across Texas. The dog detected 60 triatomines at 6 sites; an additional 50 triatomines were contemporaneously collected at 1 of these sites and 2 additional sites without the assistance of the dog. Approximately 0.98 triatomines per hour were found when only humans were conducting searches; when working with the dog, approximately 1.71 triatomines per hour were found. In total, 3 adults and 107 nymphs of four species (Triatoma gerstaeckeri, Triatoma protracta, Triatoma sanguisuga, and Triatoma indictiva) were collected. PCR testing of a subset revealed T. cruzi infection, including DTUs TcI and TcIV, in 27% of nymphs (n = 103) and 66% of adults (n = 3). Bloodmeal analysis of a subset of triatomines (n = 5) revealed feeding on Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus), and eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus). Conclusion/Significance A trained scent detection dog enhanced triatomine detections in sylvatic habitats. This approach is effective at detecting nidicolous triatomines. Control of sylvatic sources of triatomines is challenging, but this new knowledge of specific sylvatic habitats and key hosts may reveal opportunities for novel vector control methods to block the transmission of T. cruzi to humans and domestic animals.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63efdda6fef9eece724a101a045d62d868d0977d,63efdda6fef9eece724a101a045d62d868d0977d,"Devin M.

Murine colon organoids as a novel model to study Trypanosoma cruzi infection and interactions with the intestinal epithelium,"Chagas disease (CD) is a life-threatening illness caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). With around seven million people infected worldwide and over 50,000 deaths per year, CD is a major public health issue in Latin America. The main route of transmission to humans is through a triatomine bug (vector-borne), but congenital and oral transmission have also been reported. The acute phase of CD presents mild symptoms but may develop into a long-lasting chronic illness, characterized by severely impaired cardiac, digestive, and neurological functions. The intestinal tissue appears to have a key role during oral transmission and chronic infection of CD. In this immune-privileged reservoir, dormant/quiescent parasites have been suggested to contribute to disease persistence, infection relapse, and treatment failure. However, the interaction between the intestinal epithelium and T. cruzi has not been examined in depth, in part, due to the lack of in vitro models that approximate to the biological and structural complexity of this tissue. Therefore, to understand the role played by the intestinal tissue during transmission and chronic infection, physiological models resembling the organ complexity are needed. Here we addressed this issue by establishing and characterizing adult stem cell-derived colonoid infection models that are clinically relevant for CD. 3D and 2D systems of murine intestinal organoids infected with T. cruzi Dm28c (a highly virulent strain associated with oral outbreaks) were analyzed at different time points by confocal microscopy. T. cruzi was able to invade and replicate in intestinal epithelial primary cells grown as intact organoids (3D) and monolayers (2D). The permissiveness to pathogen infection differed markedly between organoids and cell lines (primate and intestinal human cell lines). So far, this represents the first evidence of the potential that these cellular systems offer for the study of host-pathogen interactions and the discovery of effective anti-chagasic drugs.",2023,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/514141697868d266be1ba868163ec78e3fe50e43,514141697868d266be1ba868163ec78e3fe50e43,"H.

Characterization of Latin American migrants at risk for Trypanosoma cruzi infection in a non-endemic setting. Insights into initial evaluation of cardiac and digestive involvement,"Background Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease (CD), a potentially fatal disease characterized by cardiac disorders and digestive, neurological or mixed alterations. T. cruzi is transmitted to humans by the bite of triatomine vectors; both the parasite and disease are endemic in Latin America and the United States. In the last decades, population migration has changed the classic epidemiology of T. cruzi, contributing to its global spread to traditionally non-endemic countries. Screening is recommended for Latin American populations residing in non-endemic countries. Methods The present study analyzes the epidemiological characteristics of 2,820 Latin American individuals who attended the International Health Service (IHS) of the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona between 2002 and 2019. The initial assessment of organ damage among positive cases of T. cruzi infection was analyzed, including the results of electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, barium enema and esophagogram. Results Among all the screened individuals attending the clinic, 2,441 (86.6%) were born in Bolivia and 1,993 (70.7%) were female. Of individuals, 1,517 (81.5%) reported previous exposure to the vector, which is a strong risk factor associated with T. cruzi infection; 1,382 individuals were positive for T. cruzi infection. The first evaluation of individuals with confirmed T. cruzi infection, showed 148 (17.1%) individuals with Chagasic cardiomyopathy, the main diagnostic method being an ECG and the right bundle branch block (RBBB) for the most frequent disorder; 16 (10.8%) individuals had a normal ECG and were diagnosed of Chagasic cardiomyopathy by echocardiogram. Conclusions We still observe many Latin American individuals who were at risk of T. cruzi infection in highly endemic areas in their countries of origin, and who have not been previously tested for T. cruzi infection. In fact, even in Spain, a country with one of the highest proportion of diagnosis of Latin American populations, T. cruzi infection remains underdiagnosed. The screening of Latin American populations presenting with a similar profile as reported here should be promoted. ECG is considered necessary to assess Chagasic cardiomyopathy in positive individuals, but echocardiograms should also be considered as a diagnostic approach given that it can detect cardiac abnormalities when the ECG is normal.",2023,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63bada597d0219b567079b6ca196e1962c0873f1,63bada597d0219b567079b6ca196e1962c0873f1,"Pedro Laynez-Roldán, Irene Losada-Galván, Elizabeth J Posada, Leonardo de la Torre Ávila, A.

Validation of a multiplex microsphere immunoassay for detection of antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi in dogs,"The vector-borne protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease in humans, dogs, and many other mammalian hosts. Canine Chagas disease is increasingly diagnosed in dogs of the southern United States where triatomine insect vectors occur, and there are limited veterinary testing options; only the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test is offered at a single accredited diagnostic laboratory. We evaluated a multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MIA) for the detection of antibodies against T. cruzi in dogs and compared it with existing serologic methods to establish cutoff values and relative sensitivity and specificity. We tested 135 canine sera that had been characterized using the IFA and off-label use of 2 commercial rapid assays with our multiplex MIA against 12 antigens: 9 T. cruzi antigens, a negative control recombinant protein (green fluorescent protein, GFP), a Leishmania antigen, and a canine parvovirus antigen (used as an antibody control given near-ubiquitous parvoviral vaccination). The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) ratio between each T. cruzi antigen and GFP was calculated for every sample. Samples with an antigen:GFP MFI ratio > 4 SDs above the mean of 25 known-negative sera were considered positive to that antigen. Samples testing positive to ≥ 2 antigens were considered positive for T. cruzi antibodies. Compared to the IFA, our multiplex MIA had a relative sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97.0%. Given its precision, high-throughput format, potential for automation, and lack of subjective interpretation, our multiplex MIA should be considered a valid and improved assay for T. cruzi antibodies in dogs.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d5f9d532cd842f1826206dfc522ecee3a064ae8,7d5f9d532cd842f1826206dfc522ecee3a064ae8,"Carlos A.

Temperature influences the excretion time and parasitic load of Trypanosoma cruzi in the Triatoma infestans vector,"Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite transmitted by triatomine insect vectors, which expel their infectious dejections when they feed, causing Chagas disease in humans. The transmission and incidence of this vector-borne disease depend on the vital traits of its vectors, including Triatoma infestans, the main vector in Southern South America. Being an ectothermic species, its metabolism and its vital traits respond to temperature fluctuations. Here, we evaluated if changes in the average and variability of temperature expected with climate change modify: (i) the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of T. cruzi within the vector T. infestans, (ii) its parasitic load, and (iii) the probability that its dejections were T. cruzi-positive. We acclimated triatomines infected with Dm28c T. cruzi strain to two constant and two variable temperature treatments and measured T. cruzi in their dejections by qPCR over a 42-day period. We observed that individuals in warm-temperature treatments showed lower EIP and higher parasitic load than cold-temperature treatments. Also, temperature variability can increase the parasitic load peak in cold-temperature treatments. Consequently, in a climate change scenario, there might be an increase in the vector capacity of T. infestans and probably a change in the risk of vectorial transmission of T. cruzi.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/84ecbaeee0af20fb588284ca01ab97c2b62a40dd,84ecbaeee0af20fb588284ca01ab97c2b62a40dd,"Clavijo-Baquet, Valenzuela-Perez, J.

Antimicrobial activity of NK cells to Trypanosoma cruzi infected human primary Keratinocytes,"Infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is causative for Chagas disease, which is a highly neglected tropical disease prevalent in Latin America. Humans are primary infected through vectorial transmission by blood-sucking triatomine bugs. The parasite enters the human host through mucous membranes or small skin lesions. Since keratinocytes are the predominant cell type in the epidermis, they play a critical role in detecting disruptions in homeostasis and aiding in pathogen elimination by the immune system in the human skin as alternative antigen-presenting cells. Interestingly, keratinocytes also act as a reservoir for T. cruzi, as the skin has been identified as a major site of persistent infection in mice with chronic Chagas disease. Moreover, there are reports of the emergence of T. cruzi amastigote nests in the skin of immunocompromised individuals who are experiencing reactivation of Chagas disease. This observation implies that the skin may serve as a site for persistent parasite presence during chronic human infection too and underscores the significance of investigating the interactions between T. cruzi and skin cells. Consequently, the primary objective of this study was to establish and characterize the infection kinetics in human primary epidermal keratinocytes (hPEK). Our investigation focused on surface molecules that either facilitated or hindered the activation of natural killer (NK) cells, which play a crucial role in controlling the infection. To simulate the in vivo situation in humans, an autologous co-culture model was developed to examine the interactions between T. cruzi infected keratinocytes and NK cells. We evaluated the degranulation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity of NK cells in response to the infected keratinocytes. We observed a strong activation of NK cells by infected keratinocytes, despite minimal alterations in the expression of activating or inhibitory ligands on NK cell receptors. However, stimulation with recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a cytokine known to be present in significant quantities during chronic T. cruzi infections in the host, resulted in a substantial upregulation of these ligands on primary keratinocytes. Overall, our findings suggest the crucial role of NK cells in controlling acute T. cruzi infection in the upper layer of the skin and shed light on keratinocytes as potential initial targets of infection.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6718100b49652b56fd9e0057096369ebf7896ca6,6718100b49652b56fd9e0057096369ebf7896ca6,"Keshia Kroh, J.

Space-environment relationship in the identification of potential areas of expansion of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in Didelphis aurita in the Atlantic Rainforest,"Ecological Niche Modeling is widely used for animals, but rarely for understanding the parasite ecology. Trypanosoma cruzi is a heterogeneous and widely dispersed multi-host parasite. Didelphis aurita is a generalist species, both in terms of diet and environments. We modeled the D. aurita niche and T. cruzi infection in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, using the models of two common vector species (Triatoma vitticeps and Panstrongylus megistus) as biotic variables, predicting their occurrence. Records of T. cruzi infected and non-infected D. aurita were analyzed through climate and landscape approaches by the Ecoland method. Models for each triatomine species and infected and noninfected D. aurita were produced considering climate and landscape: resolution of ~1km2 selected by Pearson’s correlation [-0.7≤α≤0.7]. For modeling, seven algorithms available in ModleR package were used. True Skill Statistic was used to evaluate the models’ performance (≥ 0.7). T. vitticeps indicates that there is a spatial dependence with warm areas in the southeastern region while P. megistus presented a distribution with high environmental suitability concentrated in the Southeast. High values of climatic suitability, landscape and potential presence of T. vitticeps and P. megistus were considered necessary, but not sufficient for the presence of D. aurita infected by T. cruzi. Climate models showed an ecological niche with suitability variations homogeneous, and landscape models showed a distribution of habitat conditions along the biome, with a fragmented profile and heterogeneous between locations. Ecoland demonstrated that D. aurita has different degrees of impact on its role in the enzootic cycle in different locations of the Atlantic Rainforest. Associating the models with the Ecoland method allowed the recognition of areas where D. aurita are important T. cruzi reservoirs. Areas of high suitability for the presence of marsupials are a necessary, but not sufficient for D. aurita to act as a reservoir for T. cruzi.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/398d1df5b79e7779951c656d7f8589ca9cfa0d86,398d1df5b79e7779951c656d7f8589ca9cfa0d86,"Raphael Testai, Marinez Ferreira de Siqueira, D.

Temporal assessment of entomological surveillance of Trypanosoma cruzi vectors in an endemic area of northeastern Brazil,"Entomological surveillance is essential for the control of triatomines and the prevention of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in humans and domestic animals. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate entomological indicators and triatomine control during the period from 2005 to 2015 in an endemic area in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. This observational and retrospective study was developed based on data analysis related to active entomological surveillance activities and chemical control of infested housing units (HU) in the Agreste mesoregion of the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, in the period between 2005 to 2015. The quantitative analysis of housing units surveyed for entomological indicators was performed by linear regression of random effects (p < 0.05). The effect of the number of HU surveyed on the entomological indicators was analyzed by fitting a linear random effects regression model and an increasing intradomiciliary colonization rate was significant. In the period evaluated 92,156 housing units were investigated and the presence of triatomines was reported in 4,639 (5.0%). A total of 4,653 specimens of triatomines were captured and the species recorded were Triatoma pseudomaculata (n = 1,775), Triatoma brasiliensis (n = 1,569), Rhodnius nasutus (n = 741) and Panstrongylus lutzi (n = 568), with an index of natural infection by T. cruzi of 2.2%. Only 53.1% of the infested HU were subjected to chemical control. Moreover, there was a decrease in the total number of HU surveyed over time associated with an increase in the index of intradomiciliary colonization (p = 0.004). These data demonstrated that entomological surveillance and control of vectors in the Agreste mesoregion of the state has been discontinued, emphasizing the need for more effective public policies to effectively control the vectors, in order to avoid the exposure of humans and domestic animals to the risk of T. cruzi infection.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0b22db4bf7e5405876a9dc9d13acee459e07a0d,b0b22db4bf7e5405876a9dc9d13acee459e07a0d,"George Harisson Felinto Sampaio, Andressa Noronha Barbosa da Silva, Christiane Carlos Araújo de Negreiros, Nathan Ravi Medeiros Honorato, R.

TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI INFECTION IN THREE SLENDER-TAILED MEERKATS (SURICATA SURICATTA),"Abstract: Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite primarily transmitted by triatomine insects (Hemiptera: subfamily Reduviidae) and is the cause of Chagas disease (CD). This report describes three cases of CD in a mob of five slender-tailed meerkats (Suricata suricatta) living in an outdoor exhibit at one zoological institution in Texas. The index case was a 9.5-yr-old female that presented with ataxia, lethargy, and pleural effusion. This case was diagnosed with CD postmortem via cytology, T. cruzi PCR of whole blood and lung fluid, and histology. Blood was opportunistically collected from the remaining four meerkats 28 d after the death of the index case and tested by PCR and serology. The second case was a clinically normal 7.5-yr-old male that tested PCR and antibody positive and the third case was a clinically normal 9-yr-old female that tested PCR positive. The second animal presented depressed, with pneumonia, and with continuous shivering 53 d after blood collection, and clinically improved after treatment with antibiotics and supportive care. Fifteen days later, the animal was found minimally responsive and died shortly thereafter. Histologic examination revealed Trypanosoma sp. amastigotes in the myocardium and the tissue was positive for T. cruzi DNA. The third meerkat, which received two separate courses of benznidazole over a span of almost 2 yr, was monitored routinely by PCR and serology and appeared clinically normal until found dead on exhibit 93 d after completion of the second treatment. Myocardium was positive for T. cruzi DNA. To the authors' knowledge, this case series is the first to document Chagas disease in meerkats and features associated cytologic and histologic findings.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a51a24b6e9e3518008a6fe6de730b1d71313dd3a,a51a24b6e9e3518008a6fe6de730b1d71313dd3a,"Marcela Valdés-Soto, Anne Burgdorf-moisuk, Janis A.

Extensible membrane nanotubules mediate attachment of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes under flow,"Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease, an important cause of infectious chronic myocardiopathy in Latin America. The life cycle of the parasite involves two main hosts: a triatomine (arthropod hematophagous vector) and a mammal. Epimastigotes are flagellated forms inside the triatomine gut; they mature in its intestine into metacyclic trypomastigotes, the infective form for humans. Parasites attach despite the shear stress generated by fluid flow in the intestines of the host, but little is known about the mechanisms that stabilize attachment in these conditions. Here, we describe the effect of varying levels of shear stress on attached T. cruzi epimastigotes using a parallel plate flow chamber. When flow is applied, parasites are partially dragged but maintain a connection to the surface via ~40 nm wide filaments (nanotubules) and the activity of flagella is reduced. When flow stops, parasites return near their original position and flagellar motion resumes. Nanotubule elongation increases with increasing shear stress and is consistent with a model of membrane tether extension under force. Fluorescent probes used to confirm membrane composition also show micron-wide anchoring pads at the distal end of the nanotubules. Multiple tethering accounts for more resistance to large shear stresses and for reduced flagellar movement when flow is stopped. The formation of membrane nanotubules is a possible mechanism to enhance adherence to host cells under shear stress, favoring the continuity of the parasite´s life cycle.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/81f466b243db9db363e1ddab7cc7049b95bdc7f2,81f466b243db9db363e1ddab7cc7049b95bdc7f2,"Cristhian David Perdomo-Gómez, Nancy E Ruiz-Uribe, John M.

"Expression of Proteins, Glycoproteins, and Transcripts in the Guts of Fasting, Fed, and Trypanosoma cruzi-Infected Triatomines: A Systematic Review","Chagas disease is caused by the hemoflagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. The main transmission mechanism for the parasite in endemic areas is contact with the feces of an infected triatomine bug. Part of the life cycle of T. cruzi occurs in the digestive tract of triatomines, where vector and parasite engage in a close interaction at a proteomic–molecular level. This interaction triggers replication and differentiation processes in the parasite that can affect its infectivity for the vertebrate host. With the aim of compiling and analyzing information from indexed publications on transcripts, proteins, and glycoproteins in the guts of fasting, fed, and T. cruzi-infected triatomines in the period 2000–2022, a systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines.

"Prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi, the Etiologic Agent of Chagas Disease, Infection in Texas Skunks (Mammalia: Mephitidae).","Background: Chagas disease is one of the world's most neglected tropical diseases, infecting over six million people across the Americas. The hemoparasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent for the disease, circulating in domestic, peridomestic, and sylvatic transmission cycles that are maintained by triatomine vectors and a diversity of wild and synanthropic hosts. Public health and wildlife management interventions targeting the interruption of T. cruzi transmission rely on an understanding of the dynamics driving the ecology of this zoonotic pathogen. One wildlife host that purportedly plays a role in the transmission of Chagas disease within the southern United States is the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), although infection prevalence in this species is poorly understood. Materials and Methods: To this end, we conducted a PCR-based surveillance of T. cruzi in 235 wild skunks, representing 4 species, across 76 counties and 10 ecoregions in Texas, United States, along with an evaluation of risk factors associated with the infection. Results: We recovered an overall T. cruzi prevalence of 17.9% for all mephitid taxa aggregated, ranging between 6.7% for plains spotted skunks (Spilogale putorius interrupta) and 42.9% for western spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis). We report the first cases of T. cruzi infection in plains spotted and American hog-nosed skunks (Conepatus leuconotus), of important note for conservation medicine since populations of both species are declining within Texas. Although not statistically significant, we also detected trends for juveniles to exhibit greater infection risk than adults and for differential sex biases in T. cruzi prevalence between taxa, which align with variations in species-specific seasonal activity patterns. No geographic or taxonomic risk factors were identified. Conclusion: Our study contributed key data for population viability analyses and epidemiologic models in addition to providing a baseline for future T. cruzi surveillance among skunks and other wildlife species.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c253b02df938be5b4cac1060dcbf363573b69e1a,c253b02df938be5b4cac1060dcbf363573b69e1a,"Bonnie E Gulas-Wroblewski, Rodion Gorchakov, Rebecca B Kairis, R.

"Geographic Distribution of the Genus Panstrongylus Berg, 1879 in the Neotropic with Emphasis on Trypanosoma cruzi Vectors","Panstrongylus is a Neotropical taxa of 16 species, some more widespread than others, that act as vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (CD). This group is associated with mammalian reservoir niches. There are few studies of the biogeography and niche suitability of these triatomines. Using zoo-epidemiological occurrence databases, the distribution of Panstrongylus was determined based on bioclimatic modelling (DIVA GIS), parsimonious niche distribution (MAXENT), and parsimony analysis of endemic species (PAE). Through 517 records, a wide presence of P. geniculatus, P. rufotuberculatus, P. lignarius, and P. megistus was determined and recorded as frequent vectors of T. cruzi in rainforest habitats of 24–30 °C. These distributions were modeled with AUC >0.80 and <0.90, as well as with the seasonality of temperature, isothermality, and precipitation as relevant bioclimatic variables. Individual traces for each taxon in Panstrongylus—1036 records—showed widely dispersed lines for frequent vectors P. geniculatus, P. lignarius, P. rufotuberculatus, and P. megistus. Other occasional vectors showed more restricted dispersal, such as P. howardi, P. humeralis, P. lenti, P. lutzi, P. tupynambai, P. noireaiui, and P. chinai. Areas of defined environmental variation, geological change, and trans domain fluid fauna, such as the American Transition Zone and the Pacific Domain of Morrone, had the highest Panstrongylus diversity. Pan-biogeographic nodes appear to be areas of the greatest species diversity that act as corridors connecting biotopes and allowing fauna migration. Vicariance events in the geologic history of the continent need to be investigated. The geographical distribution of Panstrongylus overlapped with CD cases and Didelphis marsupialis/Dasypus novemcinctus presence, two important reservoirs in Central and South America. The information derived from the distribution of Panstrongylus provides knowledge for surveillance and vector control programs.

Natural Trypanosoma cruzi Infection and Climatic Season Influence the Developmental Capacity in Field-Caught Mepraia spinolai Nymphs,"Simple Summary Triatomines are hemimetabolous and hematophagous insect vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The life cycle of triatomines is composed of five nymphal stages and an adult stage. The wild kissing bug Mepraia spinolai is distributed in a vast area of the semiarid Mediterranean ecosystem of South America, characterized by strongly marked seasons. The population structure of this vector changes during the different seasons, suggesting its development is controlled under natural conditions. In this study, we performed a biological assay to study this vector development after two laboratory feedings. We collected nymphs, first to fourth instars, in eight M. spinolai populations during the transition of late fall to winter (cooling period) and spring (warming period) of three consecutive years. The gathered information with vectors molting twice suggests that development is differentially controlled in nymphs from first and fourth instars depending on the climatic period of collection. Additionally, T. cruzi infection changes development forward only in nymphs of second and fourth instars of the warming period. Our findings suggest that the effect of the climatic period and T. cruzi infection on the development of this vector species is a stage-dependent phenomenon. Abstract In this study, we evaluated the effect of the climatic season and infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, etiological agent of Chagas disease, on the molting capacity of the triatomine vector Mepraia spinolai endemic to Chile. We used wild-caught first-to-fourth instar nymphs during cooling (fall and winter) and warming (spring) periods. After capturing, nymphs were fed at the laboratory, and maintained under optimal rearing conditions. Feeding was repeated 40 days later. We followed-up the molting events on 709 nymphs, recording one, two or the absence of molts after two feeding opportunities. Within the same climatic period, only infected second- and fourth-instar nymphs from the warming period showed a larger proportion of double molting compared to uninfected nymphs. Regarding the climatic period, infected and uninfected first- and fourth-instar nymphs exhibited a larger proportion of double molting in the warming and cooling periods, respectively. The pattern of non-molting nymph occurrence suggests they probably reach diapause by environmental stochasticity. The effect of the climatic period and T. cruzi infection on the development of M. spinolai is an instar-dependent phenomenon, highlighting the occurrence of finely synchronized processes at different moments of the life cycle of such an hemimetabolous insect as triatomines.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4dd99c2ef137ad6dd7d858f88905c903cba6bf04,4dd99c2ef137ad6dd7d858f88905c903cba6bf04,"Juan Botzotz, Gabriel Méndez-Valdés, Sylvia Ortíz, Angélica López, C.

Wild mammals involved in the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi and food sources of Triatoma sherlocki in an endemic region of northeastern Brazil,"The present study, carried out in the municipality of Gentio do Ouro, Bahia, Brazil aimed to evaluate which wild mammals may be involved in the transmission of T. cruzi and which are the blood sources for triatomines collected in the study area. PCR analysis of 31 wild mammals captured revealed T. cruzi infection in 6.4% (2/31): one specimen of the opossum Didelphis albiventris (1/3) and one of the rodent Kerodon rupestris (1/5); despite being more frequent in the area, no specimen of the rodent Thrichomys sp.

Comparative proteomic analysis of the hemolymph and salivary glands of Rhodnius prolixus and R. colombiensis reveals candidates associated with differential lytic activity against Trypanosoma cruzi I and T. cruzi II,"Background Immune response of triatomines plays an important role in the success or failure of transmission of T. cruzi. Studies on parasite–vector interaction have shown the presence of trypanolytic factors and have been observed to be differentially expressed among triatomines, which affects the transmission of some T. cruzi strains or DTUs (Discrete Typing Units). Methodology/Principal Findings Trypanolytic factors were detected in the hemolymph and saliva of R. prolixus against epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of T. cruzi II. To identify the components of the immune response that could be involved in this lytic activity, a comparative proteomic analysis was carried out, detecting 120 proteins in the hemolymph of R. prolixus and 107 in R. colombiensis. In salivary glands, 1103 proteins were detected in R. prolixus and 853 in R. colombiensis. A higher relative abundance of lysozyme, prolixin, nitrophorins, and serpin as immune response proteins was detected in the hemolymph of R. prolixus. Among the R. prolixus salivary proteins, a higher relative abundance of nitrophorins, lipocalins, and triabins was detected. The higher relative abundance of these immune factors in R. prolixus supports their participation in the lytic activity on T. cruzi II, but not on T. cruzi I, which is resistant to lysis by hemolymph and salivary proteins of R. prolixus due to mechanisms of evading oxidative stress caused by immune factors. Conclusions/Significance T. cruzi I is a DTU distributed from the southern United States to the center of Chile and Argentina, and its successful spread across this range could be related to resistance to oxidative stress in vectors. Future proteomic and transcriptomic studies on vectors and the interactions of the intestinal microbiota with parasites will help to confirm the determinants of successful or failed vector transmission of T. cruzi DTUs in different parts of the Western Hemisphere. Author summary Some factors can facilitate or prevent T. cruzi transmission, i.e. vector immunity. Our work has managed to detect a stronger immune response against T. cruzi II in R. prolixus saliva and haemolymph, compared to that of R. colombiensis. Proteins from both species’ saliva and haemolymph were analysed for studying factors which might have been involved in such response; most proteins were detected in both species’ haemolymph, thereby indicating common immune mechanisms. Three proteins having oxidative immune activity were only expressed in R. prolixus. Lipocalin diversity and abundance predominated in R. prolixus saliva; these proteins are involved in nitric oxide metabolism and their role in immunity could be key in host defence against T. cruzi. Recognising the components modulating parasite transmission in a vector helps in understanding how such factors act independently and how they would act synergistically against T. cruzi, thereby enabling us to establish tools regarding Chaga’s disease epidemiology, aimed at predicting T. cruzi distribution and creating transmission control mechanisms.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f1c910ba8d1dbb8b8269b5411c79eb586b064b7c,f1c910ba8d1dbb8b8269b5411c79eb586b064b7c,"Hamilton J.

An effective internet-based system for surveillance and elimination of triatomine insects: AlertaChirimacha,"Vector-borne diseases remain a significant public health threat in many regions of the world. Traditional vector surveillance and control methods have relied on active and passive surveillance programs, which are often costly and time-consuming. New internet-based vector surveillance systems have shown promise in removing some of the cost and labor burden from health authorities. We developed and evaluated the effectiveness of a new internet-based surveillance system, “AlertaChirimacha”, for detecting Triatoma infestans (known locally by its Quechua name, Chirimacha), the Chagas disease vector, in the city of Arequipa, Peru. In the first 26 months post-implementation, AlertaChirimacha received 206 reports of residents suspecting or fearing triatomines in their homes or neighborhoods, of which we confirmed, through pictures or inspections, 11 (5.3%) to be Triatoma infestans. After microscopic examination, none of the specimens collected were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. AlertaChirimacha received 57% more confirmed reports than the traditional surveillance system and detected 10% more infested houses than active and passive surveillance approaches combined. Through in-depth interviews we evaluate the reach, bilateral engagement, and response promptness and efficiency of AlertaChirimacha. Our study highlights the potential of internet-based vector surveillance systems, such as AlertaChirimacha, to improve vector surveillance and control efforts in resource-limited settings. This approach could decrease the cost and time horizon for the elimination of vector-mediated Chagas disease in the region.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/104efeb742c52d417ac9807ef6506486bdcd3410,104efeb742c52d417ac9807ef6506486bdcd3410,"Laura D Tamayo, C.

Severe Chagas disease in Ecuador: a countrywide geodemographic epidemiological analysis from 2011 to 2021,"Background Chagas disease is a neglected and often forgotten tropical disease caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite can be transmitted through the direct contact of human skin with feces and urine of the triatomine insect. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 6–7 million people are infected worldwide, killing at least 14,000 every year. The disease has been reported in 20 of the 24 provinces of Ecuador, with El Oro, Guayas, and Loja being the most affected. Methodology We analyzed the morbidity and mortality rates of severe Chagas disease in Ecuador on a nationwide, population-based level. Hospitalization cases and deaths were also examined based on altitude, including low (< 2,500 m) and high (> 2,500 m) altitudes, according to the International Society. Data was retrieved from the National Institute of Statistics and Census hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality databases from 2011 to 2021. Results A total of 118 patients have been hospitalized in Ecuador since 2011 due to Chagas disease. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 69.4% (N = 82). Men have a higher incidence rate (4.8/1,000,000) than women, although women have a significantly higher mortality rate than men (6.9/1,000,000). Conclusion Chagas disease is a severe parasitic condition that primarily affects rural and poorer areas of Ecuador. Men are more likely to be infected due to differences in work and sociocultural activities. Using average elevation data, we conducted a geodemographic analysis to assess incidence rates by altitude. Our findings indicate that the disease is more common at low and moderate altitudes, but recent increases in cases at higher altitudes suggest that environmental changes, such as global warming, could be driving the proliferation of disease-carrying vectors in previously unaffected areas.",2023,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66eaf10bdd57fd887297ce1765db69b691d263a9,66eaf10bdd57fd887297ce1765db69b691d263a9,"Jorge Vásconez-González, Juan S.

Effectiveness of fluralaner treatment regimens for the control of canine Chagas disease: A mathematical modeling study,"Background Canine Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by insect triatomine vectors known as kissing bugs. The agent can cause cardiac damage and long-term heart disease and death in humans, dogs, and other mammals. In laboratory settings, treatment of dogs with systemic insecticides has been shown to be highly efficacious at killing triatomines that feed on treated dogs. Method We developed compartmental vector-host models of T. cruzi transmission between the triatomine and dog population accounting for the impact of seasonality and triatomine migration on disease transmission dynamics. We considered a single vector-host model without seasonality, and model with seasonality, and a spatially coupled model. We used the models to evaluate the effectiveness of the insecticide fluralaner with different durations of treatment regimens for reducing T. cruzi infection in different transmission settings. Results In low and medium transmission settings, our model showed a marginal difference between the 3-month and 6-month regimens for reducing T. cruzi infection among dogs. The difference increases in the presence of seasonality and triatomine migration from a sylvatic transmission setting. In high transmission settings, the 3-month regimen was substantially more effective in reducing T. cruzi infections in dogs than the other regimens. Our model showed that increased migration rate reduces fluralaner effectiveness in all treatment regimens, but the relative reduction in effectiveness is minimal during the first years of treatment. However, if an additional 10% or more of triatomines killed by dog treatment were eaten by dogs, treatment could increase T. cruzi infections in the dog population at least during the first year of treatment. Conclusion Our analysis shows that treating all peridomestic dogs every three to six months for at least five years could be an effective measure to reduce T. cruzi infections in dogs and triatomines in peridomestic transmission settings. However, further studies at the local scale are needed to better understand the potential impact of routine use of fluralaner treatment on increasing dogs’ consumption of dead triatomines.",2023,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6847625558e3a83814d39f52dd43c5380db51170,6847625558e3a83814d39f52dd43c5380db51170,"Edem Fiatsonu, Rachel E.

"Canine Systemic Insecticides Fluralaner and Lotilaner Induce Acute Mortality of Triatoma gerstaeckeri, North American Vector of the Chagas Disease Parasite","ABSTRACT. Chagas disease is a health concern for humans and animals across the Americas, and control options targeting the triatomine vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, are limited. Host-targeted interventions may be a useful and underused tool in controlling the spread of T. cruzi from vectors to hosts. Domestic dogs are known to be key bloodmeal hosts for triatomines as well as T. cruzi reservoirs and may be an effective and practical target for host-targeted insecticide deployment. We hypothesized that treating dogs with commercially available systemic insecticides (labeled for flea and tick control) would result in mortality of triatomines after consuming treated blood. We enrolled 16 privately owned dogs into five treatment groups to receive either fluralaner (Bravecto) or lotilaner (Credelio), alone or in combination with ivermectin. Blood from dogs before the initiation of treatment served as controls. Blood was collected 0, 7, 30, 45, and 90 days after the initial canine insecticide treatment and fed to 10 Triatoma gerstaeckeri nymphs through a membrane feeder, and survival was tracked daily for 7 days and weekly thereafter. All triatomines in the control and ivermectin groups survived the initial period, with no significant difference in long-term survival. In contrast, 99.7% of triatomines that fed on blood from dogs treated with either fluralaner or lotilaner died within 3 days. Although the impact of canine treatment on suppressing vector populations is unknown, fluralaner and lotilaner appear to be a compelling option for an integrated vector management approach to triatomine control.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/946a3ab7728f99a98ac98b5407338369930cd4b3,946a3ab7728f99a98ac98b5407338369930cd4b3,"Rachel E.

A comprehensive review on potential candidates for the treatment of chagas disease,"Twenty different infectious disorders induced by bacteria, viruses, and parasites are categorized as neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) by WHO. The severity of chagas disease remains a major concern in endemic areas and an emerging public health hazard in nonendemic countries. Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of this NTD, is mostly transmitted by triatomine vectors and comprises a range of epidemiologically significant variants. Current chemotherapeutics are obsolete, and one of the primary reasons for treatment cessation is their poor safety and effectiveness. Due to the aforementioned challenges, researchers are now focusing on discovering alternative novel safe, and economically reachable therapies for the treatment of trypanosomiasis. Certain target‐based drugs that target specific biochemical processes of the causative parasites have been described as potential antichagasic agents that possesses various types of heterocyclic scaffolds. These flexible molecules have a wide range of biological actions, and various synthesized compounds with strong activity have been documented. This review aims to discuss the available literature on synthetic anti‐T. cruzi drugs that will give a food for thought to medicinal chemists thriving to design and develop such drugs. Furthermore, some of the studies discussed herein are concerned with the potential of novel drugs to block new viable sites in T. cruzi.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9cbf20b330ab6da8d0bc7e7f8a340eac61a57b2b,9cbf20b330ab6da8d0bc7e7f8a340eac61a57b2b,"Shilpi Pathak, Muskan Bhardwaj, N.

Stronger control-surveillance systems for vector-borne Chagas disease,"The multinational initiatives for the control/surveillance of Chagas launched by disease-endemic countries and the Pan American Health Organization-World Health Organization (PAHO-WHO) contributed to control house-infesting triatomine-bug populations and to reduce disease incidence. However, after 30 years, Chagas disease (CD) transmission persists the Americas. In their recent review, Rojas de Arias et al.(1) highlight the ‘practical impossibility’ of interrupting vector-borne Trypanosoma cruzi transmission, due to the zoonotic nature of most transmission cycles, with well over 100 vector species widely spread across the Americas. Then, Rojas de Arias et al.(1) emphasise the need for stronger surveillance systems to monitor and control CD. Here, I will (1) briefly discuss the prospects for interrupting vector-borne T. cruzi transmission and (2) provide an overview of some innovative approaches that, I believe, can play important roles in the development and operation of stronger control-surveillance systems for vector-borne CD. Disease control needs clear goals, and those goals often heavily depend on the natural history, risk factors, transmission routes and dynamics, pathogenesis, and treatment of the disease. Eradication, elimination, reduction of incidence, reduction of the number of severe cases, and reduction of fatality rates are all possible goals of disease control programs. (2) The most ambitious goal is disease eradication the complete elimination of an infection, with no new cases recorded in the absence of control measures. Eradication is practically impossible for zoonoses such as CD, whose etiological agent can be transmitted by 150+ vector species and infects a wide range of wild vertebrate hosts from the USA to Patagonia.(3) Therefore, the objective of a CD control program cannot be eradication, at least in the Americas. The main goal of the multinational initiatives against CD was the elimination of the strongly synanthropic, non-native populations of a few “primary” vectors mainly Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus.(4) Elimination of R. prolixus from Mexico and some countries of Central America was certified in 2011 by PAHO/WHO, but R. prolixus-infested houses were detected in rural sites in Mexico after certification.(5) Moreover, a new record of T. infestans in Mexico was recorded after 50 years.(6) In Peru, non-native T. infestans populations were not controlled in Arequipa (see references in Rojas de Arias et al.(1)). In addition, T. infestans residual foci have been detected in Brazil after certification.(7) Overall, these data indicate that elimination of non-native populations of “primary” vectors is feasible, but has many challenges. Elimination may not be the best goal for native vectors of CD.(8,9) There is a high species richness of Triatominae in the Americas.(3) Moreover, it is important to highlight that the response of some native species to vector control with insecticides was not the same as that observed for non-native species. In Brazil, for example, insecticide spraying reduced dramatically T. infestans distribution, but no significant reduction in distribution was observed for most native species. Moreover, the interruption of chemical treatment was systematically followed by recolonisation of native species,(10) mainly in unplastered houses.(11) In the state of Bahia, there was a clear reduction in the distribution of T. infestans and an increase in the relative abundance and distribution of T. sordida and T. pseudomaculata after 40 years of the vectorcontrol program. The high frequency of native triatomine species invading houses in the Americas in recent years(7,12,13) highlights the need to reinforce entomological surveillance actions to prevent CD. WHO established goals for controlling CD by 2030, including the interruption of transmission through vectorial, transfusion, transplantation and congenital routes in many endemic countries.(14) Achieving those goals is feasible for non-vector-borne transmission,(15) but many challenges remain for vector-borne transmission. Thus, I agree with de Rojas Arias et al.(1) that the WHO 2030 goal of interrupting vector-borne transmission seems unfeasible because: (i) wild triatomine populations are widespread, (ii) surveillance methods for synanthropic triatomines are not perfect, and (iii) CD still has low visibility and priority. Thus, it is necessary to reinforce the surveillance of vector-borne transmission of CD. In the next paragraphs I will highlight some innovative strategies that could help strengthen this surveillance: (I) online training for health agents (II) development of apps to identify vectors and improve surveillance with community participation and citizen science, (III) vector-borne transmission-risk mapping.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fa1818c05fd6f097382ba1499457595b0d6de12,8fa1818c05fd6f097382ba1499457595b0d6de12,R.

"Accidental importation of the vector of Chagas disease, Triatoma rubrofasciata (De Geer, 1773) (Hemiptera, Reduviidae, Triatominae), in Europe","Members of the subfamily Triatominae (Hemiptera; Reduviidae) are vectors of American trypanosomiasis, also called Chagas disease. These insects feed on blood and are capable of transmitting protozoa belonging to the genus Trypanosoma (Kinetoplastea), with T. cruzi (Chagas, 1909) being the most important vector for human and companion animal disease. Vector-borne transmission can occur through contamination of a mucous membrane or a skin opening by triatomine fecal material after a bite. Another important means of transmission is oral ingestion of contaminated unpasteurized food or drink that contains the triatomine insect or its fecal material. Most species of Triatoninae are distributed in the Americas, but a few are found in the Far East and India. One of them, Triatoma rubrofasciata, is widely distributed worldwide (Dujardin et al. 2015). The unique reference to T. rubrofasciata near Europe is from the island of Santa Maria, the southeastern-most in the Azores archipelago with a humid subtropical climate. The assignment of its presence to Europe (Schofield and Galvão 2009) would be confusing or erroneous due to the location of this Portuguese archipelago with respect to North Africa and Europe, in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. The first known citation there occurred in 1979 (Lent and Wygodzinsky 1979), but the authors did not refer to any collection data (point/date). The presence of T. rubrofasciata seems stable in the Azores, as it was included as part of the fauna of the island of Santa Maria in 2010 but, surprisingly, the species has not been collected in the rest of the islands, although it has remained in the Azores for at least 31 years (1979-2010) (Borges et al. 2010). Triatoma rubriofasciata is considered to be a poor vector of T. cruzi and it was associated with transmission in only three cases in the Americas (Lent and Wygodzinsky 1979) but not in China or Vietnam, where the species is more abundant (Hieu et al. 2019), thus it is rarely associated with T. cruzi transmission. This may be due to the long defecation timing of this species that lowers the transmission possibility to mammal hosts (Braga and Lima 1999). Nevertheless, in the Far East, this species has become a public health problem due to the numerous bites that can become more severe by swelling, itching, and secondary infection (Hieu et al. 2019, Shi et al. 2020). Several anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in Hawaii and China, (Wang and Peng 2006, Anderson and Belnap 2015). In the Far East, T. rubrofasciata is found in all habitat types, especially in urban and peri-urban and to a lesser extent in rural areas (Dujardin et al. 2015, Hieu et al. 2019). In buildings, vector abundance decreases with increasing floor levels (Hieu et al. 2019). The specimen was studied morphologically and the taxonomical identification was conducted on the basis of the key diagnostic characters (Lent and Wygodzinsky 1979):",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9f7576b5d75d28b8920cffc3562fc6d68015641c,9f7576b5d75d28b8920cffc3562fc6d68015641c,"F.

An Outbreak of Acute Chagas Disease Possibly Spread through Oral Transmission Involving Animal Reservoirs in Eastern Colombia.,"Chagas disease (CD) is a parasitic infection caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Reports of CD cases associated with oral transmission have increased, particularly in Colombia, Brazil, and Venezuela. In this investigation, parasitological, serological, and molecular tests were conducted on samples obtained from humans, mammal reservoirs, and hosts involved in the assessment of a suspected oral transmission outbreak in Cubara, Boyaca, Colombia. Seropositivity was observed in 60% (3 of 5) of index patients and 6.4% (5 of 78) of close contacts. Trypanosoma cruzi DNA was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 100% of index cases, 6.4% (5 of 78) of close contacts, 60% (6 of 10) of canines, and 100% (5 of 5) of opossums. In all index cases, the TcI lineage was identified, along with two cases of mixed infection (TcI/TcII-TcVI). Hemoculture revealed a flagellate presence in 80% of opossums, whereas all triatomine bugs tested negative. Our findings suggest a potential oral transmission route through contamination with opossum secretions.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f92b73cf8a066284dfdbda49f58a7ebaeb56f059,f92b73cf8a066284dfdbda49f58a7ebaeb56f059,"Stivenn A Gutiérrez, Jeiczon Jaimes-Dueñez, Lissa Cruz-Saavedra, C.

Assessing the impact of host predation with Holling II response on the transmission of Chagas disease,"Chagas disease is a zoonosis caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by a broad range of blood-sucking triatomine species. Recently, it is recognized that the parasite can also be transmitted by host ingestion. In this paper, we propose a Chagas disease model incorporating two transmission routes of biting-defecation and host predation between vectors and hosts with Holling II functional response. The basic reproduction number R_v of triatomine population and basic reproduction numbers R_0 of disease population are derived analytically, and it is shown that they are insufficient to serve as threshold quantities to determine dynamics of the model. Our results have revealed the phenomenon of bistability, with backward and forward bifurcations. Specifically, if R_v>1, the dynamic is rather simple, namely, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable as R_0<1 and a unique endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable as R_0>1. However, if R_v<1, there exists a backward bifurcation with one unstable and one stable positive vector equilibria, and bistability phenomenon occurs, revealing that different initial conditions may lead to disease extinction or persistence even if the corresponding R_0>1. In conclusion, predation transmission in general reduces the risk of Chagas disease, whilst it makes the complexity of Chagas disease transmission, requiring an integrated strategy for the prevention and control of Chagas disease.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66435b55cc21ae9f91267c3a579fa7191f406631,66435b55cc21ae9f91267c3a579fa7191f406631,"Jiahao Jiang, Daozhou Gao, Jiao Jiang, Xiaotian Wu"
A Scoping Review of Mathematical Models Used to Investigate the Role of Dogs in Chagas Disease Transmission,"Simple Summary Chagas disease- caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and vectored by triatomine insects (‘kissing bugs’)- poses a serious threat to human and dog health. Mathematical modeling is an important tool to assess control interventions and determine how different factors affect disease transmission. In the Chagas disease transmission cycle, the application of mathematical modeling techniques to study the role of dogs in disease epidemiology and control has not been fully understood. The purpose of this study was to review mathematical models that investigated the role of dogs in Chagas disease transmission. We examine the modeling approaches used, assess their contribution to understanding dogs’ role in Chagas disease transmission and control, and discuss their strengths and limitations. We identified ten peer-reviewed articles. Five of the ten reviewed articles focused on evaluating the effectiveness of intervention measures to control disease transmission and three focused on estimating disease transmission risk. The reviewed studies show that dogs are not only at high risk of infection but also amplify the spread of infections in endemic areas. Moreover, these studies have demonstrated that eliminating infected dogs from households or frequent use of insecticide could be sufficient to nearly interrupt disease transmission. Abstract Chagas disease is a zoonotic vector-borne disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which affects a variety of mammalian species across the Americas, including humans and dogs. Mathematical modeling has been widely used to investigate the transmission dynamics and control of vector-borne diseases. We performed a scoping review of mathematical models that investigated the role of dogs in T. cruzi transmission. We identified ten peer-reviewed papers that have explicitly modeled the role of dogs in Chagas transmission dynamics. We discuss the different methods employed in these studies, the different transmission metrics, disease transmission routes, and disease control strategies that have been considered and evaluated. In general, mathematical modeling studies have shown that dogs are not only at high risk of T. cruzi infection but are also major contributors to T. cruzi transmission to humans. Moreover, eliminating infected dogs from households or frequent use of insecticide was shown to be effective for curtailing T. cruzi transmission in both humans and dogs. However, when insecticide spraying is discontinued, T. cruzi infections in dogs were shown to return to their pre-spraying levels. We discuss the challenges and opportunities for future modeling studies to improve our understanding of Chagas disease transmission dynamics and control.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/13b34168ad392096a327f4073e14126918761dec,13b34168ad392096a327f4073e14126918761dec,"Edem Fiatsonu, Rachel E.

Metabolomics of developmental changes in Triatoma sanguisuga gut microbiota,"Triatoma sanguisuga is one of the major vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi in the southeastern US, where it sustains a robust zoonotic parasite transmission cycle and occasional human infections. A better understanding of triatomine development may allow for alternative approaches to insecticide-based vector control. Indeed, the role of the gut microbiota and bacterial endosymbionts in triatomine development and in their vectorial capacity is emerging. We investigated here the differences in microbiota among nymph and adult T. sanguisuga, to shed light on the metabolomic interactions occurring during development. Microbiota composition was assessed by 16s gene amplification and deep sequencing from field-caught adult bugs and their laboratory-raised progeny. Significant differences in microbiota bacterial diversity and composition were observed between nymphs and adults. Laboratory-raised nymphs showed a higher taxonomic diversity, and at least seven families predominated. On the other hand, field-caught adults had a lower bacterial diversity and four families comprised most of the microbiota. These differences in compositions were associated with differences in predicted metabolism, with laboratory-raised nymphs microbiota metabolizing a limited diversity of carbon sources, with potential for resource competition between bacterial families, and the production of lactic acid as a predominant fermentation product. On the other hand, field-caught adult microbiota was predicted to metabolize a broader diversity of carbon sources, with complementarity rather than competition among taxa, and produced a diverse range of products in a more balanced manner. The restricted functionality of laboratory-raised nymph microbiota may be associated with their poor development in captivity, and further understanding of the metabolic interactions at play may lead to alternative vector control strategies targeting triatomine microbiota.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e5ddb4a57345b1a6c3664e92be8dd54b7a7b156,3e5ddb4a57345b1a6c3664e92be8dd54b7a7b156,"Evan Teal, Claudia P Herrera, Eric Dumonteil"
Metacyclogenesis as the Starting Point of Chagas Disease,"Chagas disease is a neglected infectious disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, primarily transmitted by triatomine vectors, and it threatens approximately seventy-five million people worldwide. This parasite undergoes a complex life cycle, transitioning between hosts and shifting from extracellular to intracellular stages. To ensure its survival in these diverse environments, T. cruzi undergoes extreme morphological and molecular changes. The metacyclic trypomastigote (MT) form, which arises from the metacyclogenesis (MTG) process in the triatomine hindgut, serves as a crucial link between the insect and human hosts and can be considered the starting point of Chagas disease.

"Occurrence and distribution of Panstrongylus megistus (Burmeister, 1835) (Hemiptera, Reduviidae) in a metropolitan area of Southern Brazil","ABSTRACT Two triatomine genera (Panstrongylus and Triatoma) have essentially been recorded in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. Panstrongylus megistus should be highlighted since this species is one of the main vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi in Brazil, due to its wide geographical distribution and the high susceptibility to this protozoan. This study aimed to present not only the occurrence and distribution of P. megistus in the Porto Alegre city’s metropolitan area (PAMA), Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, but also the rates of T. cruzi infection, from 2009 to 2020. The PAMA, which comprises 34 cities and 4.4 million habitants, extends across the transition area in two biomes – Pampa and Mata Atlantica – found in the state. Results showed that P. megistus was recorded in 76.5% of cities (i.e., 26 out of 34), mainly in Porto Alegre city, where the vector was found in 11 out of the 12 years that were monitored. Three hundred and nineteen specimens were captured. Two hundred and sixty-seven specimens (83.7%) were located intradomicile (p < 0.0001), while 52.3% positivity for T. cruzi was found. Thus, P. megistus is important in the PAMA, because it invades and colonizes the households. Moreover, the high rates of T. cruzi infection have drawn attention.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2165161989fba67e79f719555c34791a5b6a93e2,2165161989fba67e79f719555c34791a5b6a93e2,"F.

A qualitative exploration of knowledge of Chagas disease among adolescents in rural Ecuador.,"INTRODUCTION
Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease that affects 6 to 7 million people worldwide. In South America, CD is a major health problem in several regions, causing more than 12 000 deaths per year. CD is caused by a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi, mostly transmitted through the contaminated feces of certain species of triatomine bug, commonly known as the 'kissing bug'. CD is endemic in Loja province in the southern region of Ecuador, where triatomines have been found in 68% of communities. Previous promotion of healthy practices in Loja province have included educational programs directed toward youth to affirm cultural and social norms that support health and prevent CD transmission. The present study was designed to evaluate current knowledge related to CD among youth in the three communities of Loja province following previous intervention programs.


METHODS
A descriptive, qualitative approach was applied using individual semi-structured interviews with 14 young people (eight females, six males) from three rural communities in Loja province. Interviews assessed knowledge about CD transmission, knowledge about the parasite-vector-disease pathway, and the role of youth in preventing Chagas disease in their communities.


RESULTS
Following a thematic analysis of the data, the study results showed there is cursory knowledge of the triatomine insect that can carry the causative parasite for CD. Participants were able to generally talk about the vector, habitat and prevention practices for triatomine infestation. Nevertheless, limited understanding of transmission dynamics in the parasite-vector-disease pathway itself was found. One major finding was that prevention practices were not correctly applied or followed, increasing the risk of exposure in the community. Youth also articulated that CD is stigmatized in their communities, which may be a barrier for prevention efforts.


CONCLUSION
Gaps in knowledge about the parasite-vector-disease pathway were identified among youth. Overall, youth responses indicated positive regard for prevention practices and a desire to be involved in prevention programs. Developing educational programs focusing on CD transmission may be needed to improve control and prevention of this parasitic disease. The implications of these findings are discussed for developing effective control programs in the region.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10ddde031026b70e1bc50f1b13b1c7d868357edf,10ddde031026b70e1bc50f1b13b1c7d868357edf,"Patricia Mora-Criollo, M.

"Vector mapping and bloodmeal metabarcoding demonstrate risk of urban Chagas disease transmission in Caracas, Venezuela","Chagas disease is a significant public health risk in rural and semi-rural areas of Venezuela. Triatomine infection by the aetiological agent Trypanosoma cruzi is also observed in the Metropolitan District of Caracas (MDC), where foodborne T. cruzi outbreaks occasionally occur but active vector-to-human transmission (infection during triatomine bloodmeal) is considered absent. Citizen science-based domiciliary triatomine collection carried out between 2007 and 2013 in the MDC has advanced understanding of urban T. cruzi prevalence patterns and represents an important public awareness-building tool. The present study reports on the extension of this triatomine collection program from 2014 to 2019 and uses mitochondrial metabarcoding to assess feeding behavior in a subset of specimens. The combined, thirteen-year dataset (n = 4872) shows a high rate of T. cruzi infection (75.2%) and a predominance of Panstrongylus geniculatus (99.01%) among triatomines collected in domiciliary areas by MDC inhabitants. Collection also involved nymphal stages of P. geniculatus in 18 of 32 MDC parishes. Other collected species included Triatoma nigromaculata, Triatoma maculata, Rhodnius prolixus, and Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus. Liquid intestinal content indicative of bloodmeal was observed in 53.4% of analyzed specimens. Dissection pools representing 108 such visually blooded P. geniculatus specimens predominantly tested positive for human cytochrome b DNA (22 of 24 pools). Additional bloodmeal sources detected via metabarcoding analysis included key sylvatic T. cruzi reservoirs (opossum and armadillo), rodents, and various other synanthropic and domesticated animals. Results suggest a porous sylvatic-domiciliary transmission interface and ongoing adaptation of P. geniculatus to the urban ecotope. Although P. geniculatus defecation traits greatly limit the possibility of active T. cruzi transmission for any individual biting event, the cumulation of this low risk across a vast metropolitan population warrants further investigation. Efforts to prevent triatomine contact with human food sources also clearly require greater attention to protect Venezuela’s capital from Chagas disease.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/60f9aaf6165e7419aa28c9a6e77180fb27d46087,60f9aaf6165e7419aa28c9a6e77180fb27d46087,"Maikell J Segovia, P.

GeoVin - a project with technological innovation and community participation for the comprehensive approach to Chagas disease and triatomines (Hemiptera: Reduviidae),"Chagas disease is one of the most important public health problems in America, involving triatomines (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae) in the vectorial transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi (Protista: Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatidae). In Argentina, 15 species of triatomines are distributed, of which seven are the most common in the domicile and peridomicile, while the rest are mainly associated with wild environments. Due to the lack of updated data of geographic distribution, the GeoVin Project arises to provide not only a triatomine digital tool of triatomine notification, but also resources with information about Chagas and triatomine vectors. The aim of this paper is to present, describe and highlight the progress of the project, emphasizing the principles of participatory science and entomological surveillance. So far, more than 2,300 web visits have been recorded and the application has been downloaded over 3,400 times. The contribution of the project in articulating with the corresponding government health agencies and the immediacy of the interaction with the community are key elements for the project success. At the same time, the information collected is a constant input for updating the geographical distributions of Argentinian triatomines.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/949780b2ec18a31bb37df30d41f1ee6d490bb7e3,949780b2ec18a31bb37df30d41f1ee6d490bb7e3,"Gerardo A.

"Biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment follow‐up, and prediction of cardiac complications in Chagas disease in chronic phase: Recent advances","Chagas disease is caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite and is transmitted by infected triatomine bugs. This infection affects approximately 8 million people in the Americas, and due to globalisation and displacement, it is becoming increasingly common to find infected patients worldwide. Diagnosis of the disease in its acute form is relatively simple, as the parasite can be detected in peripheral blood smears, and symptoms are visible. However, in its chronic condition, the parasite is almost undetectable, and indirect tests are necessary to determine the presence of antibodies in infected patients. It is important to note that a single test is not enough to confirm the disease in this phase, as a second serological test should confirm the diagnosis. If the results are contradictory, a third test should be performed to confirm or discard the disease. Unfortunately, laboratories may not have access to all necessary tests in many rural areas where the disease is more frequent. Rapid tests to diagnose this disease present problems, such as significant variations in sensitivity and specificity in different countries. Therefore, searching for new biomarkers that allow for optimal correlation is essential. In this work, we have searched scientific literature from the last 10 years for mentions of novel biomarkers for diagnosis, treatment follow‐up, and prediction of cardiac complications in Chagas disease in its chronic phase.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/903117d3591fb1be7c46f26a3c2931d8c7d91889,903117d3591fb1be7c46f26a3c2931d8c7d91889,"M.

"Histology and histochemistry of the accessory gland of the female reproductive tract of Rhodnius neglectus Lent, 1954 (Hemiptera: Reduviidae).","Rhodnius neglectus is a wild triatomine, vector of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas' disease, and feeds on the blood of small mammals, being essential for its growth and reproduction. Accessory glands of the female reproductive tract are important in insect reproduction, but their anatomy and histology in R. neglectus are poorly studied. The aim of this work was to describe the histology and histochemistry of the accessory gland of the female reproductive tract of R. neglectus. The reproductive tract of five females of R. neglectus was dissected and the accessory glands transferred to Zamboni's fixative solution, dehydrated in a crescent series of ethanol, embedded in historesin, sectioned at 2 µm thick, stained with toluidine blue for histological analysis or mercury bromophenol blue for detection of total proteins. The accessory gland R. neglectus is tubular, without branches, opening in the dorsal region of the vagina and differing along its length in proximal and distal regions. In the proximal region, the gland is lined by the cuticle with a layer of columnar cells associated with muscle fibers. In the distal region of the gland, the epithelium has spherical secretory cells with terminal apparatus and conducting canaliculi opening in the lumen through pores in the cuticle. Proteins were identified in the gland lumen, terminal apparatus, nucleus and cytoplasm of secretory cells. The histology of the R. neglectus gland is similar to that found in other species of this genus, but with variations in the shape and size of its distal region.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5ece42c5c3912f22b45e2c80d9857bdd536f468f,5ece42c5c3912f22b45e2c80d9857bdd536f468f,"D.

Analysis of the Perception of Brazilian Medical Students about Chagas Disease,"Considering that health professionals at Brazil had doubts about the entomoepidemiological issues of Chagas disease (CD), and that many of them highlighted not feeling totally safe for clinical care, the knowledge of 281 Brazilian medical students was evaluated through a cross-sectional, descriptive, prospective, and quantitative research. Most students demonstrated that they knew about the etiological agent of CD (Trypanosoma cruzi), since 279 students answered the questionnaire correctly. Furthermore, the medical students demonstrated knowledge of the main form of transmission of the parasite, as 278 students associated CD transmission with triatomines. On the other hand, approximately 25 students did not associate CD transmission with triatomine feces. Besides that, these future health professionals had difficulties in relation to the treatment of CD, as more than half of the students (176) wrongly answered that CD “is not curable” or “is curable in the chronic phase”. Based on the results obtained that point out the difficulties medical students have with CD, there is a need for undergraduate medical courses to address the neglected diseases holistically because the National Curriculum Guidelines for the medical course require the training of competent health professionals capable of integrating the biological, psychological, social, and environmental dimensions.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b9d39b00c2bf9b889f6a8785eb7ae6365c677ea7,b9d39b00c2bf9b889f6a8785eb7ae6365c677ea7,"Everton Rodrigues Clovis, D.

Effectiveness of Systemic Insecticide Dog Treatment for the Control of Chagas Disease in the Tropics,"Simple Summary Chagas disease, a vector-borne disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant threat to human and canine health in the tropics. To control the transmission of T. cruzi, systemic insecticide treatment of dogs with fluralaner has been proposed as an intervention for canine and potentially human Chagas disease. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of canine treatment regimens with fluralaner to reduce Chagas disease infections (once every three months and once every twelve months) in high and low endemic regions using a data-driven mathematical model. Our study shows that Fluralaner treatment can effectively reduce T. cruzi transmission in humans, but may increase infections in dogs if canine consumption of triatomine increases. The effectiveness of the treatment regimen was shown to vary substantially with the underlying intensity of T. cruzi transmission and the increased rate of canine consumption of dead triatomines. Our study provides new evidence to support further empirical studies on the potential impact of mass treatment of dogs with systemic insecticides as a novel and additional intervention for the control and elimination of Chagas disease in the tropics. Abstract Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by triatomines, can lead to severe cardiac issues and mortality in many mammals. Recent studies have shown that systemic insecticide treatment of dogs is highly effective in killing triatomines. Here, we assessed the impact of dog treatment on T. cruzi transmission. We developed a mathematical model of T. cruzi transmission among triatomines, dogs, humans, and rodents. We used the model to evaluate the impact of dog treatment regimens on T. cruzi transmission dynamics to determine their effectiveness in reducing T. cruzi infection among hosts. We show that a 3-month treatment regimen may reduce T. cruzi incidence among humans by 59–80% in a high transmission setting, and 26–82% in a low transmission setting. An annual treatment may reduce incidence among humans by 49–74% in a high transmission setting, and by 11–76% in a low transmission setting. However, dog treatment may substantially increase T. cruzi prevalence among dogs if dog consumption of dead triatomines increases. Our model indicates that dog treatment may reduce T. cruzi infections among humans, but it may increase infections in dogs. Therefore, a holistic approach targeting different hosts is necessary for Chagas elimination.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8a1287b5453e8163747999491cec8a273e5485d,a8a1287b5453e8163747999491cec8a273e5485d,"Edem Fiatsonu, Aniruddha Deka, M.

Review of Kissing Bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae) from China with Descriptions of Two New Species,"Simple Summary Triatominae, commonly known as kissing bugs, are blood-feeding insects that can carry the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi to spread Chagas disease. In this study, we conducted a taxonomic review of Chinese triatomines, which involved describing two new species, Triatoma picta Zhao & Cai sp. nov. and T. atrata Zhao & Cai sp. nov. We also calculated the pairwise genetic distances of Triatoma and offered a key to species of Triatominae in China. This review may facilitate a better understanding of the diversity of Chinese kissing bugs. Abstract Triatominae, the only blood-sucking subfamily in Reduviidae, are the vectors of Chagas disease. The majority of them are distributed in the Americas, while the diversity in China has been underestimated, as only two species have been recorded. Here, we describe two new species from China, Triatoma picta Zhao & Cai sp. nov. and T. atrata Zhao & Cai sp. nov., and provide a redescription of T. sinica Hsiao, 1965, along with remarks on T. rubrofasciata (De Geer, 1773). To facilitate the identification, we include photos, especially of genitalia, as well as a distribution map and a key to Chinese triatomines.

The Pampa del Indio project: District-wide quasi-elimination of Triatoma infestans after a 9-year intervention program in the Argentine Chaco,"Background The elimination of Triatoma infestans, the main domestic vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, is lagging behind expectations in the Gran Chaco region. We implemented an insecticide-based intervention program and assessed its long-term effects on house infestation and bug abundance in a resource-constrained municipality (Pampa del Indio, northeastern Argentina) inhabited by creole and the Qom indigenous people (2007–2016). Key questions were whether district-wide data integration revealed patterns concealed at lower spatial levels; to what extent preintervention infestation and pyrethroid resistance challenged the effectiveness of insecticide-based control efforts, and how much control effort was needed to meet defined targets. Methods Supervised vector control teams i) georeferenced every housing unit at baseline (1,546); ii) evaluated house infestation using timed-manual searches with a dislodging aerosol across four rural areas designated for district-wide scaling up; iii) sprayed with pyrethroid insecticide 92.7% of all houses; iv) periodically monitored infestation and promoted householder-based surveillance, and v) selectively sprayed the infested houses, totaling 1,823 insecticide treatments throughout the program. Results Baseline house infestation (mean, 26.8%; range, 14.4–41.4%) and bug abundance plummeted over the first year postintervention (YPI). Timed searches at baseline detected 61.4–88.0% of apparent infestations revealed by any of the methods used. Housing dynamics varied widely among areas and between Qom and creole households. Preintervention triatomine abundance and the cumulative frequency of insecticide treatments were spatially aggregated in three large clusters overlapping with pyrethroid resistance, which ranged from susceptible to high. Persistent foci were suppressed with malathion. Aggregation occurred mainly at house compound or village levels. Preintervention domestic infestation and abundance were much greater in Qom than in creole households, whereas the reverse was recorded in peridomestic habitats. House infestation, rare (1.9–3.7%) over 2–6 YPI, averaged 0.66% (95% confidence interval, 0.28–1.29%) at endpoint. Conclusions Upscale integration revealed multiple coupled heterogeneities (spatial, sociodemographic and biological) that reflect large inequalities, hamper control efforts, and provide opportunities for targeted, sustainable disease control. High-coverage, professional insecticide spraying combined with systematic surveillance-and-response were essential ingredients to achieve the quasi-elimination of T. infestans within 5 YPI and concomitant transmission blockage despite various structural threats and constraints.",2023,8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f1756a3853914836d371bb7c72579c0069f14744,f1756a3853914836d371bb7c72579c0069f14744,"R.

"Climate and Environmental Changes and Their Potential Effects on the Dynamics of Chagas Disease: Hybridization in Rhodniini (Hemiptera, Triatominae)","Simple Summary All 155 living species of triatomines are considered to be potential vectors of Chagas disease. Laboratory and field studies demonstrate that these insects are capable of crossing and producing hybrids. Hybrids of Triatoma spp. have a greater capacity and vectorial competence to acquire and transmit Trypanosoma cruzi than the parental species. Therefore, we conducted studies to assess whether the Rhodnius spp. and Psammolestes spp. that live in sympatry (if found in natural conditions) or allopatry (geographically isolated) are capable of producing hybrids. We observed that all cross species produce hybrid offspring in at least one direction. Although the vectorial capacity and competence of these insect vectors must be evaluated, we emphasize the importance of directing the monitoring activities of vector control programs toward possible natural hybridization events in the face of climatic and environmental changes. Abstract Chagas disease affects about eight million people. In view of the issues related to the influence of anthropogenic changes in the dynamics of the distribution and reproductive interaction of triatomines, we performed experimental crosses between species of the Rhodniini tribe in order to evaluate interspecific reproductive interactions and hybrid production capacity. Reciprocal crossing experiments were conducted among Rhodnius brethesi × R. pictipes, R. colombiensis × R. ecuadoriensis, R. neivai × R. prolixus, R. robustus × R. prolixus, R. montenegrensis × R. marabaensis; R. montenegrensis × R. robustus, R. prolixus × R. nasutus and R. neglectus × R. milesi. With the exception of crosses between R. pictipes ♀ × R. brethesi ♂, R. ecuadoriensis ♀ × R. colombiensis ♂ and R. prolixus ♀ × R. neivai ♂, all experimental crosses resulted in hybrids. Our results demonstrate that both allopatric and sympatric species produce hybrids, which can generate concern for public health agencies in the face of current anthropogenic events. Thus, we demonstrate that species of the Rhodniini tribe are capable of producing hybrids under laboratory conditions. These results are of great epidemiological importance and raise an important discussion about the influence of climatic and environmental interactions on Chagas disease dynamics.",2023,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c76aea5538905bef23fa8be09d1804db6a4330d7,c76aea5538905bef23fa8be09d1804db6a4330d7,"Amanda Ravazi, J.

Microbiomes of Blood-Feeding Triatomines in the Context of Their Predatory Relatives and the Environment,"This study places microbiomes of blood-feeding North American Triatoma vectors (Reduviidae) into a broader evolutionary and ecological context provided by related predatory assassin bugs (Reduviidae), another unrelated vector species (soft tick Ornithodoros turicata), and the environment these arthropods coinhabit. For both vectors, microbiome analyses suggest three interrelated sources of bacteria, i.e., the microbiome of vertebrate nests as their natural habitat, the vertebrate skin microbiome, and the pathobiome circulating in vertebrate blood. ABSTRACT The importance of gut microbiomes has become generally recognized in vector biology. This study addresses microbiome signatures in North American Triatoma species of public health significance (vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi) linked to their blood-feeding strategy and the natural habitat. To place the Triatoma-associated microbiomes within a complex evolutionary and ecological context, we sampled sympatric Triatoma populations, related predatory reduviids, unrelated ticks, and environmental material from vertebrate nests where these arthropods reside. Along with five Triatoma species, we have characterized microbiomes of five reduviids (Stenolemoides arizonensis, Ploiaria hirticornis, Zelus longipes, and two Reduvius species), a single soft tick species, Ornithodoros turicata, and environmental microbiomes from selected sites in Arizona, Texas, Florida, and Georgia. The microbiomes of predatory reduviids lack a shared core microbiota. As in triatomines, microbiome dissimilarities among species correlate with dominance of a single bacterial taxon. These include Rickettsia, Lactobacillus, “Candidatus Midichloria,” and Zymobacter, which are often accompanied by known symbiotic genera, i.e., Wolbachia, “Candidatus Lariskella,” Asaia, Gilliamella, and Burkholderia. We have further identified a compositional convergence of the analyzed microbiomes in regard to the host phylogenetic distance in both blood-feeding and predatory reduviids. While the microbiomes of the two reduviid species from the Emesinae family reflect their close relationship, the microbiomes of all Triatoma species repeatedly form a distinct monophyletic cluster highlighting their phylosymbiosis. Furthermore, based on environmental microbiome profiles and blood meal analysis, we propose three epidemiologically relevant and mutually interrelated bacterial sources for Triatoma microbiomes, i.e., host abiotic environment, host skin microbiome, and pathogens circulating in host blood. IMPORTANCE This study places microbiomes of blood-feeding North American Triatoma vectors (Reduviidae) into a broader evolutionary and ecological context provided by related predatory assassin bugs (Reduviidae), another unrelated vector species (soft tick Ornithodoros turicata), and the environment these arthropods coinhabit. For both vectors, microbiome analyses suggest three interrelated sources of bacteria, i.e., the microbiome of vertebrate nests as their natural habitat, the vertebrate skin microbiome, and the pathobiome circulating in vertebrate blood. Despite an apparent influx of environment-associated bacteria into the arthropod microbiomes, Triatoma microbiomes retain their specificity, forming a distinct cluster that significantly differs from both predatory relatives and ecologically comparable ticks. Similarly, within the related predatory Reduviidae, we found the host phylogenetic distance to underlie microbiome similarities.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e33bd43f2cb35384dc6064abf2a73bf40c2a28e,0e33bd43f2cb35384dc6064abf2a73bf40c2a28e,"Hassan Tarabai, A.

Characterization of External Female Genitalia in Five Triatoma Laporte Species of South America (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae),"Currently, there are 158 valid species of triatomines, all of which are potential vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. The correct taxonomic identification of triatomines is essential since each species hos a different epidemiological importance. The aim of the study is to compare five species of South American Triatoma. Here we present a comparative study of terminal abdominal segments in females by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the species Triatoma delpontei, T. jurbergi, T. infestans var. melanosoma, T. platensis, and T. vandae. The results showed diagnostic characters for the studied species. The dorsal view featured more valuable characters, with seven informative characters. Similarities were observed among T. delpontei, T. infestans var. melanosoma, and T. platensis, and between T. jurbergi and T. vandae, correlating with previous studies. Thus, female genital characters proved to be reliable and useful in the diagnosis of the Triatoma species studied here; additional studies, along with other sets of behavioral, morphological, and molecular data, helped to reinforce the hypotheses found here.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f48c897f9578984e63a1200326c32cb210148cfd,f48c897f9578984e63a1200326c32cb210148cfd,"João Paulo Sales Oliveira-Correia, H.

Gene editing in the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius prolixus by Cas9-mediated ReMOT Control,"Rhodnius prolixus is currently the model vector of choice for studying Chagas disease transmission, a debilitating disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasites. Despite the broad use of double-stranded RNA interference for the knockdown of gene function in R. prolixus, transgenesis and gene editing protocols are still lacking. Here we tested Receptor-Mediated Ovary Transduction of Cargo (ReMOT Control) and direct parental injection of CRISPR (DIPA-CRISPR) for the maternal delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 elements to developing R. prolixus oocytes, and strategies for the identification of insertions/deletions (indels) in target loci of resulting gene-edited G0 nymphs. We demonstrate successful ReMOT Control-mediated gene editing of the eye color markers Rp-scarlet and Rp-white, and the cuticle color marker Rp-yellow, with highest effectiveness obtained using the ovary-targeting BtKV ligand. These results provide proof-of-concepts for generating somatic mutations in R. prolixus and potentially for generating germline edited lines in triatomines. Our studies also suggest that optimal strategies for recovery of mutations include performing multiple gRNA injections and the use of visible phenotypes such as those displayed in the Rp-scarlet, Rp-white and Rp-yellow loci for future Co-CRISPR experiments. These results will lay the foundation for gene editing protocols for triatomines and could lead to the development of novel control strategies for vectors of Chagas disease. Author Summary Rhodnius prolixus is an insect vector of the protozoan Trypanossoma cruzi, causative agent of debilitating Chagas disease. To fight the spread of the disease, it has been suggested that biological control of the insect should be attempted. Gene editing by the novel CRISPR methodology holds great promise in this sense, as it enables to target almost any gene in the genome for mutagenesis, thus allowing the control of insect physiology and reproduction. Here we have tested protocols for the delivery of CRISPR reagents as an attempt to enable genome editing of the vector. Our results show that maternal delivery of CRISPR by the ReMOT Control method is efficient for mutating eye and cuticle color genes in the resulting nymphs, generating edited animals with red eyes, white eyes or a yellow cuticle. This is the first report of gene editing in a vector of Chagas disease and should lay the basis to produce modified animals either unable to carry the T. cruzi parasite or to reproduce.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4394bf11be7035c3fc34444bf5248846952cf59e,4394bf11be7035c3fc34444bf5248846952cf59e,"Leonardo Lima, M.

"Epidemiological indicators of Chagas disease in the metropolitan region of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil","ABSTRACT Background: Chagas disease (CD) is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by triatomines. Historical information from the 20th century demonstrates T. cruzi records in the metropolitan region of Salvador (MRS), the third largest urban agglomeration in the Brazilian Northeast and the eighth largest in Brazil, an area with intense migratory activity from CD-endemic regions. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate CD indicators (prevalence and mortality) in the MRS. Methods: A mixed ecological and descriptive study was conducted using secondary data. We analyzed data from 2008 to 2015: deaths due to CD, self-reported cases of CD, and blood donors that were non-negative for T. cruzi infection. Results: São Francisco do Conde was one of the municipalities with the highest mortality rates due to CD. The seroprevalence rates varied by year and municipality; those with the highest values were 2008: Vera Cruz, 2009: Mata de São João, 2010: Dias D'Ávila, 2011 and 2015: São Francisco do Conde, 2012: São Sebastião do Passé, and 2013 and 2014: Pojuca. Spatial correlations between the municipalities were not detected. Conclusions: We conclude that CD is present in the MRS. The indicators analyzed in the MRS are below-state-level data. Given the importance of indicator analysis for the surveillance and control of CD at the state and national levels, it is important to strengthen the surveillance program at the municipal level, including the regions classified as low risk for T. cruzi vector transmission.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4daccddeee8e944b69f7533afda899a9256a2a68,4daccddeee8e944b69f7533afda899a9256a2a68,"F.

Cytogenetic Key to Identification of Triatominae Species Reported in an Outbreak Region of Oral Transmission of Chagas Disease in the Brazilian Northeast.,"Oral transmission from the consumption of processed food with triatomines and/or their feces infected with Trypanosoma cruzi prevails among recent cases of Chagas disease in Brazil. In Paraíba, a state of the Brazilian northeast, there was an outbreak caused by the consumption of sugarcane juice that resulted in 26 cases of infection and one death. Until now, 10 species of triatomines have been reported in this Brazilian state. Thus, we developed a dichotomous key to assist in the correct identification of Paraíba triatomines based on cytogenetic data. The dichotomous key allowed the differentiation of all the species in this state. Although the purpose of CytoKeys is not to replace dichotomous keys based on morphological data, the use of these complementary keys can help to solve taxonomic problems, preventing identification errors, especially between similar species such as Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma petrocchiae, both present in the Brazilian northeast.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f6e27e97ec219f862139a9305fcf7e1b92a85d2,2f6e27e97ec219f862139a9305fcf7e1b92a85d2,"Emercio Felisberto Nhapulo, Denis Vinícius de Mello, Laura Poloto Cesaretto, Julia Junqueira Alevi, D.

Parasites: The Inside Story,"P The Inside Story shows how parasites coexisted and spread around the world through host migration, particularly through humans, and researches their origin and evolution. The book describes how the choice of host has affected the successful survival of some parasites and avoidance of extinction. The authors show how parasites influence and manipulate their intermediate host, which makes them more visible and easier prey for the next host, causing the host to “look foolish.” The authors use novel and entertaining approaches to explore their subject, such as describing how the Israelite Jonah spent 3 days in the belly of a whale and what parasites he might have encountered during that 3-day stay. Another entertaining approach was participation in the parasite Olympics, where parasites earned medals according to their success and survival by choosing and adjusting to their hosts. Ascaris lumbricoides is a gold medal winner as one of the most durable internal parasites of humans. However, the book overlooked Strongyloides stercoralis, which can cause hyperinfection syndrome in immunocompromised hosts and is considered an emerging infectious disease and deserves an honorary Olympic medal. Babesiosis is another notable emerging parasitic disease that was overlooked. I appreciated the novel and appealing way in which the authors show how parasites affect other species and human lives, while also incorporating their nonharmful roles, as in the case of mutualism and commensalism. I loved the immense and vivid imagery used to describe the breathtaking basin of the Congo River but was saddened that many persons living along the river might not continue to see that beautiful scenery because of river blindness caused by Onchocerca volvulus. The stories, connections to real persons, and references to at least 3 movies and 1 television series indicate the detailed efforts involved in writing this book. The book has a high level of scientific detail as it dives into history, ecology, evolution, and future outlooks. The authors discuss how climate change is affecting parasite existence. An example is the migration of triatomine kissing bugs to the southern half of the United States, which might increase the risk for Trypanosoma cruzi transmission, causing Chagas disease (to which the book attributes Charles Darwin’s death, from an infection he acquired during a trip to South America). The authors also elaborate on international scientific collaboration during epidemiologic investigations, such as the collaboration between researchers from the United States and Mongolia during a hantavirus infection outbreak in New Mexico. Readers will learn about parasite eradication campaigns, some of which did not turn out well, as was the case for the Schistosoma mansoni eradication campaign in Egypt that resulted in populationwide infections with hepatitis C virus. The book has 29 color photos, making the stories only more vibrant, and helps in understanding parasite life cycles and in making diagnoses. This book will appeal to readers interested in emerging infectious diseases, nonparasitologists, scientists, and clinicians and is an admirable expedition into the amazing world of parasites.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4654f475630f38b150a637624817a85787cadf79,4654f475630f38b150a637624817a85787cadf79,Rezhan H.
