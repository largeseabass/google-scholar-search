Trypanosoma cruzi Parasite Burdens of Several Triatomine Species in Colombia,"Trypanosoma cruzi, the causal agent of Chagas disease, is mainly transmitted by insects of the Triatominae subfamily. In Colombia, there are 26 triatomine species, and 16 of them are naturally infected with the parasite. The parasite loads of naturally infected vectors can be significant in targeting specific species that can affect the epidemiology of the disease. Studying their ecology and behavior is vital to understand their role in T. cruzi transmission dynamics. We evaluated the parasite loads of 182 field-collected triatomines corresponding to 10 species in 13 departments across Colombia. We standardized a methodology to quantify T. cruzi DNA in these insects. We obtained a LOD (limit of detection) of 3.05 p-eq/mL. The 82% of triatomines we evaluated were positive for T. cruzi infection, with loads ranging from hundreds to millions of equivalent parasites per milliliter. Panstrongylus geniculatus, Rhodnius prolixus, and Triatoma dimidiata were the species with the highest loads of T. cruzi; however, other species whose role as vectors is still unknown were also found with high loads of parasites. Our results suggest the relevance of secondary species for T. cruzi transmission in Colombia. We hope our data can help improve entomological surveillance and vector control programs in the country and the region.",2022,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c667ebab5eb20037445f4283b323bace7b6b86d,7c667ebab5eb20037445f4283b323bace7b6b86d,"Natalia Velásquez-Ortiz, C.

Blood-Meal Sources and Trypanosoma cruzi Infection in Coastal and Insular Triatomine Bugs from the Atacama Desert of Chile,"Mepraia parapatrica is one of the lesser known and less abundant sylvatic triatomine species naturally infected by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. M. parapatrica lives in sympatry with T. cruzi-infected rodents, but only birds, reptiles, and marine mammals have been reported as blood-meal sources of this vector species by serology. The distribution range of this kissing bug overlaps with fishers’ settlements and tourist areas, and therefore the study of the blood-meal sources of this triatomine species is relevant. Here, we determined the blood-meal sources of M. parapatrica by NGS or standard sequencing from a coastal mainland area and an island in northern Chile, and T. cruzi infection by real-time PCR. The blood-meals of. M parapatrica included 61.3% reptiles, 35.5% mammals (including humans) and 3.2% birds. Feeding on reptiles was more frequent on the mainland, while on the island feeding on mammals was more frequent. The presence of T. cruzi-infected triatomine bugs and humans as part of the diet of M. parapatrica in both areas represents an epidemiological threat and potential risk to the human population visiting or established in these areas. Currently there are no tools to control wild triatomines; these results highlight the potential risk of inhabiting these areas and the necessity of developing information campaigns for the community and surveillance actions.",2022,6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27f56cbfb6292129ffbc95ebd5b842b08bbeaf4a,27f56cbfb6292129ffbc95ebd5b842b08bbeaf4a,"N.

"RNA as a feasible marker of Trypanosoma cruzi viability during the parasite interaction with the triatomine vector Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera, Triatominae)","A recurring question concerning Trypanosoma cruzi DNA detection/quantification is related to the fact that DNA amplification, by itself, does not differentiate between viable or dead parasites. On the other hand, RNA can be considered a potential molecular marker of pathogens viability. Herein, we developed a quantitative real-time PCR with reverse Transcription (RT-qPCR) to quantify viable T. cruzi in artificially infected Rhodnius prolixus whilst evaluating differences between DNA and mRNA quantification along the insect midgut during 5, 9, 15 and 29 days after feeding. The RT-qPCR presented an improved performance with linearities ranging from 107 to 102 parasites equivalents and 3 to 0.0032 intestine unit equivalents, and efficiencies of 100.3% and 102.8% for both T. cruzi and triatomine targets, respectively. Comparing both RT-qPCR and qPCR, we confirmed that RNA is faster degraded, no longer being detected at day 1 after parasite lysis, while DNA detection was stable, with no decrease in parasite load over the days, even after parasite lysis. We also observed statistical differences between the quantification of the parasite load by DNA and by RNA on day 15 after feeding of experimentally infected R. prolixus. When assessing different portions of the digestive tract, by RT-qPCR, we could detect a statistically significant reduction in the parasite amount in the anterior midgut. Oppositely, there was a statistically significant increase of the parasite load in the hindgut. In conclusion, for this study parasite’s viability in R. prolixus digestive tract were assessed targeting T. cruzi mRNA. In addition, differences between DNA and RNA detection observed herein, raise the possibility that RNA is a potential molecular viability marker, which could contribute to understanding the dynamics of the parasite infection in invertebrate hosts.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50f679878360a9643cda6763e4fda9a3465decf9,50f679878360a9643cda6763e4fda9a3465decf9,"Paula Finamore-Araujo, Gabriel Lucio Silva da Fonseca, C.

The Parasite Load of Trypanosoma cruzi Modulates Feeding and Defecation Patterns of the Chagas Disease Vector Triatoma infestans,"Trypanosoma cruzi is the causal agent of Chagas disease, a parasitic zoonosis transmitted mainly through the feces of triatomine insects. Triatoma infestans is the main triatomine vector of this disease in South America. Previous research has shown that T. cruzi infection modifies the behavior of triatomines. We evaluated, for the first time, the effect of parasite load on feeding and defecation behavior, which we quantified by using real-time PCR. The detection time of the host was shorter in infected individuals, and the number of bites increased, while the dejection time was reduced when compared with the non-infected group. A significant correlation between the parasite load and the behavioral changes registered in the infected triatomines was found. These results would indicate that the intensity of T. cruzi infection modulates the feeding and defecation behavior of T. infestans, increasing the vector competence of this triatomine vector.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fe6d3427cf59f713be01e42cf8bca5697ff4756,8fe6d3427cf59f713be01e42cf8bca5697ff4756,"F.

"Enzootic Trypanosoma cruzi infection by Rhodnius prolixus shows transmission to humans and dogs in Vichada, Colombia","Background Rhodnius prolixus is considered the most relevant Trypanosoma cruzi vector in Colombia and Venezuela due it is responsible for domestic transmission in both countries. However, a wild population of this species is distributed in the eastern plains of the Orinoco region and Amazonia jungle, where its epidemiological importance has not been sufficiently elucidated. This study aimed to assess epidemiological parameters of T. cruzi transmission in the Department of Vichada, Colombia. Methods We determined the characteristics of T. cruzi transmission using entomological studies in domestic and sylvatic ecotopes. We analyzed the T. cruzi infection in triatomine insects, identified blood meal sources, and conducted a serological determination of T. cruzi infection in scholar-aged children, domestic dogs, and wild hosts. Results Fifty-four triatomine bugs, 40 T. maculata and 14 R. prolixus were collected in peridomestic and sylvatic ecotopes. Infected R. prolixus was observed in La Primavera, Santa Rosalia, and Cumaribo municipalities. All the T. maculata bugs were not infected. Serological analysis indicated that two of 3,425 children were T. cruzi positive. The seroprevalence in domestic dogs was 10,5% (49/465). Moreover, 22 synanthropic mammals were sampled, being Didelphis marsupialis the most common. TcI genotype was detected in seropositive dogs, R. prolixus, and D. marsupialis. Conclusion The present work describes extra domestic R. prolixus and D. marsupialis in a sylvatic T. cruzi transmission cycle with transmission to humans and domestic dogs in Colombia’s Vichada Department.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/257549e5ccf18f564680b584fab37c9a6676725e,257549e5ccf18f564680b584fab37c9a6676725e,"Omar Cantillo-Barraza, C.

"Interrogating the transmission dynamics of Trypanosoma cruzi (Trypanosomatida, Trypanosomatidae) by Triatoma venosa (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) after the elimination of vector transmission by Rhodnius prolixus in Boyacá eastern Colombia","Graphical Abstract Chagas disease (CD) is a parasitic zoonosis (Trypanosoma cruzi) that is endemic in Colombia. Vector control of Rhodnius prolixus, the main domestic T. cruzi vector, has been achieved in a large part of the area with historically vector transmission of CD. It is necessary to understand the ecological behavior characteristics of local native vectors to ensure sustainability of the vector control programs. To evaluate the long-term success of a recent vector control campaign in the Boyacá department (Colombia), we used a combined strategy of entomological surveillance with co-existing canine surveillance from ten rural villages within six municipalities of the Tenza valley region (Boyacá, Colombia): Chinavita, Garagoa, Guateque, Somondoco, Sutatenza and Tenza, with historical reports of R. prolixus and secondary vectors. Collected triatomines and canine whole blood were analyzed for T. cruzi infection and genotyping. Triatomine bugs specimens were evaluated for blood meal source. Canine serology was performed using two distinct antibody assays. In total, 101 Triatoma venosa were collected by active search in domestic and peridomestic habitats. A natural infection prevalence of 13.9% (14/101) and four feeding sources were identified: human, dog, rat, and hen. A frequency infection of 46.5% (40/87) was observed from two independent serological tests and T. cruzi DNA was detected in 14 dogs (16.4%). Only TcIsylvatic DTU was detected. The results suggest that T. venosa present eco-epidemiological characteristics to maintain the transmission of T. cruzi in Tenza valley. This species has reinfested the intervened households and it has an active role in domestic and peridomestic transmission of T. cruzi due to their infection rates and feeding behavior. Therefore, this species should be considered as epidemiologically relevant for vector control strategies. Moreover, there is a need for human serological studies to have a close up of risk they are exposed to.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9e21f594ecbebceb537909e6edb1a0af13b5db85,9e21f594ecbebceb537909e6edb1a0af13b5db85,"M.

"An induced population of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes more resistant to complement lysis promotes a phenotype with greater differentiation, invasiveness, and release of extracellular vesicles","Introduction Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, which uses blood-feeding triatomine bugs as a vector to finally infect mammalian hosts. Upon entering the host, the parasite needs to effectively evade the attack of the complement system and quickly invade cells to guarantee an infection. In order to accomplish this, T. cruzi expresses different molecules on its surface and releases extracellular vesicles (EVs). Methods Here, we have selected a population of epimastigotes (a replicative form) from T. cruzi through two rounds of exposure to normal human serum (NHS), to reach 30% survival (2R population). This 2R population was characterized in several aspects and compared to Wild type population. Results The 2R population had a favored metacyclogenesis compared with wild-type (WT) parasites. 2R metacyclic trypomastigotes had a two-fold increase in resistance to complementmediated lysis and were at least three times more infective to eukaryotic cells, probably due to a higher GP82 expression in the resistant population. Moreover, we have shown that EVs from resistant parasites can transfer the invasive phenotype to the WT population. In addition, we showed that the virulence phenotype of the selected population remains in the trypomastigote form derived from cell culture, which is more infective and also has a higher rate of release of trypomastigotes from infected cells. Conclusions Altogether, these data indicate that it is possible to select parasites after exposure to a particular stress factor and that the phenotype of epimastigotes remained in the infective stage. Importantly, EVs seem to be an important virulence fator increasing mechanism in this context of survival and persistence in the host.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d8a52baf1a3506032d8f8ac700b03668049095e,0d8a52baf1a3506032d8f8ac700b03668049095e,"I.

"Identification of the parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, in multiple tissues of epidemiological significance in the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana): Implications for environmental and vertical transmission routes","Background Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasitic protozoan, is endemic to the Americas and the causative agent of Chagas disease in humans. In South America, opossums facilitate transmission via infected anal gland secretions in addition to transmission via triatomine vectors. In North America, the Virginia opossum is a reservoir host for the parasite with transmission routes that are not clearly defined. The unique biology of this marsupial provides the opportunity to investigate vertical transmission in this wildlife species in situ. Our objectives were to investigate alternative routes of transmission that may facilitate spillover into other species and to determine if vertical transmission was evident. Methodology/Principal findings Virginia opossums were sampled at 10 trapping locations over a 10-month period in a 5-county region of north central Florida. Peripheral blood, fecal swabs, and anal gland secretions were collected from each adult individual, and peripheral blood was collected from joey opossums. Total DNA was extracted from each collected sample type, and T. cruzi infected individuals and the infecting Discrete Typing Unit (DTU) were identified using real time PCR methods. Adult Virginia opossums (n = 112) were infected with T. cruzi (51.8%, 95% CI [42.6–60.8%]) throughout the sampled period and at each location. T. cruzi DNA was found in each of the three biological sample types. Vertical transmission of T. cruzi was inferred in one litter of mother-dependent (n = 20, 5.0%, 95% CI [0.9–23.6%]) joey opossums where 2 joeys from this same litter were rtPCR positive for T. cruzi. Conclusions/Significance We inferred vertical transmission from mother to neonate which may serve to amplify the prevalence of T. cruzi in adult Virginia opossums. T. cruzi DNA was detected in the anal gland secretions of Virginia opossums. Infected anal gland secretions suggest a possible environmental route of transmission for T. cruzi via the deposition of contaminated feces and spraint at wildlife latrines. Only DTU1 was identified in the sampled population which is consistent with human autochthonous cases in the United States.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4c2c8021db84262f54ccfc168adab67c239f4481,4c2c8021db84262f54ccfc168adab67c239f4481,"Carson W.

Rhodnius prolixus Hemolymph Immuno-Physiology: Deciphering the Systemic Immune Response Triggered by Trypanosoma cruzi Establishment in the Vector Using Quantitative Proteomics,"Understanding the development of Trypanosoma cruzi within the triatomine vector at the molecular level should provide novel targets for interrupting parasitic life cycle and affect vectorial competence. The aim of the current study is to provide new insights into triatomines immunology through the characterization of the hemolymph proteome of Rhodnius prolixus, a major Chagas disease vector, in order to gain an overview of its immune physiology. Surprisingly, proteomics investigation of the immunomodulation of T. cruzi-infected blood reveals that the parasite triggers an early systemic response in the hemolymph. The analysis of the expression profiles of hemolymph proteins from 6 h to 24 h allowed the identification of a broad range of immune proteins expressed already in the early hours post-blood-feeding regardless of the presence of the parasite, ready to mount a rapid response exemplified by the significant phenol oxidase activation. Nevertheless, we have also observed a remarkable induction of the immune response triggered by an rpPGRP-LC and the overexpression of defensins 6 h post-T. cruzi infection. Moreover, we have identified novel proteins with immune properties such as the putative c1q-like protein and the immunoglobulin I-set domain-containing protein, which have never been described in triatomines and could play a role in T. cruzi recognition. Twelve proteins with unknown function are modulated by the presence of T. cruzi in the hemolymph. Determining the function of these parasite-induced proteins represents an exciting challenge for increasing our knowledge about the diversity of the immune response from the universal one studied in holometabolous insects. This will provide us with clear answers for misunderstood mechanisms in host–parasite interaction, leading to the development of new generation strategies to control vector populations and pathogen transmission.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66d71903ebaff7439786d69437bf238c532debda,66d71903ebaff7439786d69437bf238c532debda,"Radouane Ouali, Larissa Rezende Vieira, D.

"Domestic Triatoma spp. Infections with Trypanosoma cruzi, Household Infestations, and Molecular Identification in Oaxaca, México","Simple Summary Here, we report entomological and parasitological data on triatomine vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, in a highly endemic region of México. The morphological and molecular identification of four principal domestic species, Triatoma phyllosoma, T. barberi, T. mazzotti, and T. dimidiata, was conducted, and their presence in Oaxaca was documented based on observations from this study in comparison to municipality records from prior published studies. We document the highly endophilic behavior of four triatomine species infected with T. cruzi. The present work carried out in Oaxaca was necessary for ongoing efforts to reach the goal of reducing the Chagas disease burden in Mexico and beyond. Abstract In Latin America, Mexico is the country with the second highest annual estimated number of Chagas disease cases, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, due to vector-borne transmission. The state of Oaxaca is the location of the first documented human cases of Chagas disease in Mexico and contained the highest T. cruzi seropositive rate (3.5%) from blood donors. Here, entomological surveys, from 2017 to 2019, were conducted to collect triatomines in 124 villages of 60 municipalities. Four principal domestic Triatoma spp. (Hemiptera: Triatominae), Triatoma phyllosoma, T. barberi, T. mazzotti, and T. dimidiata, of Oaxaca, Mexico were identified by morphology and molecular analysis of the barcode region of the cytochrome oxidase 1 (cox1 or COI or CO1) gene. A total of 41 out of 83 T. phyllosoma specimens examined by microscopy were positive for T. cruzi (49%), 49 out of 171 for T. barberi (28%), 31 out of 177 for T. mazzotti (17%), and none out of 10 for T. dimidiata (0%). Overall, the infestation index was 3.1% of households containing at least one triatomine; the crowding index was a mean of two Triatoma spp./household; and the colonization index was 0.38 for households based on presence of nymphs. Geographical distribution of triatomines in Oaxaca at the municipality level and endophilic behavior is also reported. Precise identification, endophilic habits, and infection rates of these triatomines are paramount for vector control programs of the Ministry of Health of Oaxaca and beyond.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d13fc0f182a909da5fd34dde932ca9770e5a8e8,6d13fc0f182a909da5fd34dde932ca9770e5a8e8,"Nadia A Fernandez-Santos, J.

"Genetic diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi strains isolated from chronic chagasic patients and non-human hosts in the state of São Paulo, Brazil","BACKGROUND Trypanosoma cruzi shows an exuberant genetic diversity. Currently, seven phylogenetic lineages, called discrete typing units (DTUs), are recognised: TcI-TcVI and Tcbat. Despite advances in studies on T. cruzi and its populations, there is no consensus regarding its heterogeneity. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to perform molecular characterisation of T. cruzi strains, isolated in the state of São Paulo, to identify the DTUs involved and evaluate their genetic diversity. METHODS T. cruzi strains were isolated from biological samples of chronic chagasic patients, marsupials and triatomines through culture techniques and subjected to molecular characterisation using the fluorescent fragment length barcoding (FFLB) technique. Subsequently, the results were correlated with complementary information to enable better discrimination between the identified DTUs. FINDINGS It was possible to identify TcI in two humans and two triatomines; TcII/VI in 19 humans, two marsupials and one triatomine; and TcIII in one human host, an individual that also presented a result for TcI, which indicated the possibility of a mixed infection. Regarding the strains characterised by the TcII/VI profile, the correlation with complementary information allowed to suggest that, in general, these parasite populations indeed correspond to the TcII genotype. MAIN CONCLUSIONS The TcII/VI profile, associated with domestic cycles and patients with chronic Chagas disease, was the most prevalent among the identified DTUs. Furthermore, the correlation of the study results with complementary information made it possible to suggest that TcII is the predominant lineage of this work.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c1f5d8ba5aac383c7d9bb9a134b3905fab1342e,7c1f5d8ba5aac383c7d9bb9a134b3905fab1342e,"Thiago Kury Moreno de Souza, E.

"Trypanosoma cruzi and Chagas disease: diversity, progress and challenges","Diversity The wide-ranging diversity of T. cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, became clear when multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) analysis of human genetics was transposed to trypanosomatids, initially to Trypanosoma brucei, and then to T. cruzi. The application of MLEE to a rural area of Brazil, published in 1977, revealed two radically distinct genetic groups of T. cruzi, one associated with domestic transmission by the triatomine Panstrongylus megistus and the other with sylvatic transmission by Triatoma tibiamaculata.(1) Strikingly, comparisons of T. cruzi MLEE diversity in Venezuela, published in 1981, revealed that the principal domestic disease agent in Venezuela corresponded to the prevalent sylvatic T. cruzi in the rural region of Brazil.(2) This led to the hypothesis that different clinical presentations of Chagas disease in Brazil and Venezuela might be associated with the two distinct MLEE ‘zymodemes’ of T. cruzi.(2) As indicated, in the detailed review of Messenger et al.,(3) there followed a series of wide-ranging MLEE analyses of T. cruzi strains, which included the Amazon region (1978,1981,1984) Bolivia (1983, with Michel Tibayrenc), Chile (1984,1987, with Werner Apt), Paraguay (1984), Colombia (1985), Ecuador (1985), Central Brazil (1986). An outcome of this research was the identification and distribution of six different MLEE groups of T. cruzi, as summarised in Table I of the review of Messenger et al.,(3) and with some evidence of hybrid isoenzyme profiles. The advent of multilocus sequence typing (MLST), led to a more robust and direct genetic analysis of T. cruzi isolates. Souto et al.,(4) cited in the Zingales and Bartholomeu review, used MLST to confirm presence of the same two principal genetic groups of T. cruzi that were identified in 1977 by MLEE in Brazil.(1) Brisse et al.,(5) used a combination of MLST targets and confirmed the presence of six principal lineages (or distinct taxonomic units, DTUs), which corresponded with the six groups previously identified by MLEE. The six Brisse DTUs were initially named TcI and TcIIa to TcIIe. However, the initial MLST nomenclature of Brisse et al. did not appropriately represent the relationship between the six lineages. Therefore, TcI to TcVI was suggested as an alternative, with TcV and TcVI recognised as hybrids of TcII and TcIII.(6) This nomenclature was adopted in the 2009 revision meeting organised by Zingales, as cited in the current review. Recently, a seventh DTU has been proposed, similar to TcI. It is conceivable that more DTUs remain to be discovered.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/186835ef6460bd63e8abc862852be4f17528f7b1,186835ef6460bd63e8abc862852be4f17528f7b1,M. Miles
"New Cell Lines Derived from Laboratory Colony Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus, Vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, Do Not Harbour Triatoma Virus","Simple Summary Arthropod vector cell lines play an important role in research on the biology and control of blood-feeding insects and the diseases they transmit. Kissing bugs of the genera Triatoma and Rhodnius transmit Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease in humans in tropical Latin America. We have developed new cell lines from two of the major vectors of T. cruzi, Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus, and have shown that they do not harbour any contaminating bacteria or known insect-borne viruses. We propose that the new cell lines may be suitable host cells for Triatoma virus, a natural pathogen of T. infestans that has been proposed as a biocontrol agent but cannot be grown in existing cell lines. The new cell lines may also be used to study interactions between trypanosomes and cells of their vectors. Abstract Triatomine bugs of the genera Triatoma and Rhodnius are vectors of Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease of humans in South America caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Triatoma virus (TrV), a natural pathogen of Triatoma infestans, has been proposed as a possible tool for the bio-control of triatomine bugs, but research into this virus has been hampered by a lack of suitable host cells for in vitro propagation. Here we report establishment and partial characterisation of continuous cell lines from embryos of T. infestans (TIE/LULS54) and Rhodnius prolixus (RPE/LULS53 and RPE/LULS57). RNAseq screening by a sequence-independent, single primer amplification approach confirmed the absence of TrV and other RNA viruses known to infect R. prolixus, indicating that these new cell lines could be used for propagation of TrV.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07d1925291f47ef37025ec59ffa7396fcbd9042f,07d1925291f47ef37025ec59ffa7396fcbd9042f,"Rebekah Penrice-Randal, Catherine Hartley, A.

"Parasitemia and Differential Tissue Tropism in Mice Infected with Trypanosoma cruzi Isolates Obtained from Meccus phyllosoma in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico","Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasite transmitted by the feces of triatomines. Many triatomine species are found in Mexico, and various T. cruzi variants have been isolated from these species, each showing very different virulence and cell tropism. The isolates were obtained from Meccus phyllosoma specimens in three localities in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico: Tehuantitla, Vixhana, and Guichivere. The virulence of each isolate was assessed by quantifying parasitemia, survival, and histopathologic findings. The lineage of each isolate was identified using the mini-exon gene. The expression of the tssa gene during infection was detected in the heart, esophagus, gastrocnemius, and brain. Our results show that the maximum post-infection parasitemia was higher for the Tehuantitla isolate. On genotyping, all isolates were identified as T. cruzi I. The amastigotes in the heart and gastrocnemius were verified for all isolates, but in the brain only for Tehuantitla and Vixhana. The tssa expression allowed us to detect T. cruzi isolates, for Tehuantitla, predominantly in the heart. For Vixhana, a higher tssa expression was detected in gastrocnemius, and for Guichivere, it was higher in the esophagus. Results show that virulence, tropism, and tssa expression can vary, even when the isolates are derived from the same vector species, in the same region, and at similar altitudes.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7551c09850d22570e0113a6071b2edd46bbdcfb5,7551c09850d22570e0113a6071b2edd46bbdcfb5,"A.

Impact of home improvements and health education on the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas in a rural area of western Mexico,"ABSTRACT: Chagas disease is one of the most important vector-borne diseases in Latin America. Instituting home improvement preventive measures and increasing health education contribute to successful control of the triatomine insect vector. The impact of home and road improvements and health education upon the inhabitants of 37 human dwellings in three small towns in western Mexico were studied. Initially, few house roofs were made of concrete and few walls were cement-lined. Almost all houses initially lacked metal window screens and none used barbed wire fences. One year after the intervention, all of these measures were more common, and almost 100% of houses continued to use window screens and barbed wire fences ten years post-intervention. By ten years post-intervention, >75% of houses had cement-lined walls. Initially, 24.3% of human dwellings were infested with Triatoma longipennis Usinger; at one and ten years post-intervention, only 2.7% of dwellings were infested. The abundance of peridomestic opossums decreased after intervention and remained low ten years later. Approximately 10% of dogs were infected in both surveys. Human infections decreased from 2.98% to zero by 13 years post-intervention.

"Toward New Epidemiological Landscapes of Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida, Trypanosomatidae) Transmission under Future Human-Modified Land Cover and Climatic Change in Mexico","Chagas disease, caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi, is an important yet neglected disease that represents a severe public health problem in the Americas. Although the alteration of natural habitats and climate change can favor the establishment of new transmission cycles for T. cruzi, the compound effect of human-modified landscapes and current climate change on the transmission dynamics of T. cruzi has until now received little attention. A better understanding of the relationship between these factors and T. cruzi presence is an important step towards finding ways to mitigate the future impact of this disease on human communities. Here, we assess how wild and domestic cycles of T. cruzi transmission are related to human-modified landscapes and climate conditions (LUCC-CC). Using a Bayesian datamining framework, we measured the correlations among the presence of T. cruzi transmission cycles (sylvatic, rural, and urban) and historical land use, land cover, and climate for the period 1985 to 2012. We then estimated the potential range changes of T. cruzi transmission cycles under future land-use and -cover change and climate change scenarios for 2050 and 2070 time-horizons, with respect to “green” (RCP 2.6), “business-as-usual” (RCP 4.5), and “worst-case” (RCP 8.5) scenarios, and four general circulation models. Our results show how sylvatic and domestic transmission cycles could have historically interacted through the potential exchange of wild triatomines (insect vectors of T. cruzi) and mammals carrying T. cruzi, due to the proximity of human settlements (urban and rural) to natural habitats. However, T. cruzi transmission cycles in recent times (i.e., 2011) have undergone a domiciliation process where several triatomines have colonized and adapted to human dwellings and domestic species (e.g., dogs and cats) that can be the main blood sources for these triatomines. Accordingly, Chagas disease could become an emerging health problem in urban areas. Projecting potential future range shifts of T. cruzi transmission cycles under LUCC-CC scenarios we found for RCP 2.6 no expansion of favourable conditions for the presence of T. cruzi transmission cycles. However, for RCP 4.5 and 8.5, a significant range expansion of T. cruzi could be expected. We conclude that if sustainable goals are reached by appropriate changes in socio-economic and development policies we can expect no increase in suitable habitats for T. cruzi transmission cycles.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/219612d81c2d87f1131f0f7ec048ca564f91fb02,219612d81c2d87f1131f0f7ec048ca564f91fb02,"C.

"Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma rangeli in Acre, Brazilian Amazonia: Coinfection and Notable Genetic Diversity in an Outbreak of Orally Acquired Acute Chagas Disease in a Forest Community, Wild Reservoirs, and Vectors","Acute Chagas disease (ACD) caused by Trypanosoma cruzi has emerged as a major food-borne disease in Brazilian Amazonia. For the first time, we characterized an outbreak of orally acquired ACD in Acre, in the forest community of Seringal Miraflores, affecting 13 individuals who shared the pulp of açai palm berries: 11 adults and two children (one newborn), all diagnosed by thick-drop blood smears. The fluorescent fragment length barcoding method, which simultaneously identifies species/genotypes of trypanosomes in blood samples, uncovered an unprecedented genetic diversity in patients from a single outbreak of ACD: T. cruzi TcI in all patients, mostly concomitantly with the non-pathogenic Trypanosoma rangeli of genotypes TrA or TrB, and TcI, TcIV, and TrB in the child. The patients presented persistent fever, asthenia, myalgia, edema of the face and lower limbs, hepatosplenomegaly and, rarely, cardiac arrhythmia. The clinical symptoms were not correlated to gender, age, or to trypanosome species and genotypes. The inferred SSU rRNA phylogenetic analyses of trypanosomes from humans, triatomines and sylvatic hosts included the first sequences of T. cruzi and T. rangeli from humans in southwestern (Acre and Rondônia) Amazonia, and the first TcI/TcIV sequences from Rhodnius spp. from Acre. The sylvatic transmission cycles of genetically different trypanosomes in landscapes changed by deforestation for human settlements and increasing açai production is a novel scenario favoring trypanosome transmission to humans in Acre.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ce87193aed1d1ddc63c0ad131ebfbdb0bdcb79cc,ce87193aed1d1ddc63c0ad131ebfbdb0bdcb79cc,"José Gabriel Vergara-Meza, A.

"Profile of natural Trypanosoma cruzi infection among dogs from rural areas of southern Espírito Santo, Brazil","ABSTRACT Background: The emergence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection via oral transmission has a habitual character in its primitive endemic cycle. Recent findings revealed the first death by oral transmission of T. cruzi in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, in 2012, which was recorded in the rural area of Guarapari. This study evaluated the characteristics related to the occurrence of natural T. cruzi infection among dogs from the rural areas of Alegre and Iconha, municipalities of Espírito Santo. Methods: Logistic regression analysis of factors contributing to serological detection of T. cruzi in dogs was performed in environments where Espírito Santo’s Department of Health Surveillance had previously notified triatomines positive for Trypanosoma spp. from 2014 to 2017. Results: A total of 36 dogs were analyzed, of which 10 (27.77%) tested positive, one was borderline (2.79%), and 25 tested negative (69.44%) for T. cruzi infection. São Caetano, a district from the Iconha municipality, presented a 25 times greater chance for the detection of positive tests (OR:25; 95% CI; 2.37->100). Dogs with updated mandatory vaccination presented with a lower risk of positive serodiagnosis (OR:0.12; 95% CI: 0.02-0.63). Conclusions: Our results highlight for the first time the occurrence of natural T. cruzi canine infection, detected in the municipality of Iconha, mainly among dogs with un-updated mandatory vaccines in the district of São Caetano.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6969fbef7f4290fa6e759fc20202c397ea9e2f48,6969fbef7f4290fa6e759fc20202c397ea9e2f48,"Beathriz Giostri Pontes, M.C.C.

Until recently, the State of Puebla, Mexico had no official reported chronic cases of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas. The State has conditions of social and ecological marginalization for transmission of infectious agents to be effective. Entomological indices and triatomines at the municipality of Xayacatlán de Bravo, Puebla were analyzed, as well as the DTU of circulating T. cruzi. In total, 117 triatomines were collected. The isolated strains of T. cruzi were molecularly characterized using the 24Sa rRNA and miniexon markers. Results indicated Meccus pallidipennis Stål and Triatoma bassolsae are at the municipality of Xayacatlán de Bravo. We found natural infection rate of 33.3%, and the circulating DTU was TcI.

Trypanosoma cruzi Parasite Load Modulates the Circadian Activity Pattern of Triatoma infestans,"Simple Summary We studied the locomotor activity of one of the kissing bug species that transmit the Chagas disease-causing parasite in humans, which usually bites during the night. To date, no other reports researching its behavior take into account the amount of parasites inside the kissing bug; however, some studies have demonstrated that the presence of parasites modifies the activity of some kissing bug species. We recorded their movements in light and dark conditions after part of the insects fed on mammals that had the parasite and others fed on those that did not have the parasite. Later, their amounts of parasites were quantified. We found that, compared with insects with no parasites, kissing bugs with higher parasite amounts increase the number of times they move and the distance they travel, especially during daylight hours. This could imply that the insect increases its time searching for a food source when it is infected with a higher number of parasites, and this could increase the risk of transmission of the parasite to people by the kissing bug. Abstract American trypanosomiasis is a disease caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted mainly in endemic areas by blood-sucking triatomine vectors. Triatoma infestans is the most important vector in the southern cone of South America, exhibiting a nocturnal host-seeking behavior. It has been previously documented that the parasite produces changes in some triatomine species, but this is the first time that the behavior of a vector has been evaluated in relation to its parasite load. After comparing the movement events and distance traveled of infected and non-infected T. infestans, we evaluated the change produced by different T. cruzi parasite loads on its circadian locomotor activity. We observed differences between infected and non-infected triatomines, and a significant relation between the parasite load and the increase in locomotor activity of T. infestans, which was accentuated during the photophase. This could have direct implications on the transmission of T. cruzi, as the increased movement and distance traveled could enhance the contact of the vector with the host, while increasing the predation risk for the vector, which could both constitute a risk for vectorial and oral transmission to mammals.",2022,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/24e6cd8a4176ab10a4db939436c52ebca2bd00cb,24e6cd8a4176ab10a4db939436c52ebca2bd00cb,"F.

"Southwestern national park service employee risk, knowledge, and concern for triatomine exposure: A qualitative analysis using a novel knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey","Chagas disease (CD), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected parasitic infection in the United States (US). In the Southwestern US, National Park Service (NPS) employees are a unique population with potential exposure to CD. This population lives in close contact with several species of sylvatic triatomine bugs, the vectors of T. cruzi, that may enter residential buildings at night. Despite the higher potential risk of CD transmission for southwestern NPS employees, the socio-cultural factors that impact autochthonous CD transmission in the US remain unknown. To address this gap, we investigated how NPS employee knowledge and attitudes impact their triatomine preventive behaviors. We distributed a 42-item online questionnaire to NPS employees at four national parks in Arizona and Texas. We detected high self-reported bite exposure in NPS housing, despite moderate- to high-frequency of prevention behaviors. Specific behaviors, such as often or always repairing window screens, were associated with a decreased risk of putative triatomine bug exposure. Additionally, NPS employees had low knowledge of CD. For those with greater knowledge of CD, it was not associated with increased frequency of prevention behavior. We found that increased CD anxiety was associated with increased personal agency to reduce the risk of CD. These results demonstrate the influence of knowledge and attitudes regarding CD on triatomine prevention behavior within a potential high-risk population in the US, and the importance of utilizing strategies beyond provision of education to influence behaviors.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73f6e701cf4b79b5902c50c09d9af53efb2e46d6,73f6e701cf4b79b5902c50c09d9af53efb2e46d6,"Antonio Alvarado, Emily M.

"Triatomine fauna in the state of Bahia, Brazil: What changed after 40 years of the vector-control program?","ABSTRACT Background: Neglected tropical diseases are a growing threat to global health, and endemic Chagas disease has emerged as one of the most important health problems in America. The main strategy to prevent Trypanosoma cruzi transmission is chemical control of vectors. This study presents a descriptive analysis of synanthropic triatomines before and after the implementation of a vector-control program in Bahia, Brazil. Methods: Descriptive analysis and geospatial statistics were performed on triatomine data, (1) the relative abundance and (2) proportional spatial distribution, from Bahia during two periods: (A) 1957 to 1971 and (B) 2006 to 2019. Results: We observed a decrease in the relative abundance of Panstrongylus megistus (A: n=22.032, 61.9%; B: n=1.842, 1.0%) and Triatoma infestans (A: n=1.310, 3.7%; B: n=763, 0.43%), as well as an increase in the relative abundance of T. sordida (A: n=8.314, 23.4%, B: n=146.901, 81.6%) and T. pseudomaculata (A: n=894, 2.5%, B: n=16.717, 9.3%). Conclusions: Our results indicate a clear reduction in the occurrence of P. megistus and T. infestans (last record in 2015) and an increase in the relative abundance and geographical distribution of T. sordida and T. pseudomaculata after 40 years of the vector-control program.

The Neglected Virome of Triatomine Insects,"The Triatominae subfamily (Reduviidae) harbors some hematophagous insect species that have been firmly connected to the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Triatomines not only host and transmit trypanosomatids, but also coexist with a variety of symbiotic microorganisms that generally reside in the insect’s intestinal flora. The microbiome has profound effects on the physiology, immunity, fitness and survival of animals and plants. The interaction between triatomines and bacteria has been investigated to some extent and has revealed important bacteria symbionts. In contrast, the range of viral species that can infect triatomine insects is almost completely unknown. In some cases, genomic and metatranscriptomic approaches have uncovered sequences related to possible viral genomes, but, to date, only eight positive single-strand RNA viruses, namely Triatoma virus and Rhodnius prolixus viruses 1 - 7 have been investigated in more detail. Here, we review the literature available on triatomine viruses and the viruses-insect host relationship. The lack of broader metagenomic and metatranscriptomic studies in these medically relevant insects underscores the importance of expanding our knowledge of the triatomine virome both for surveillance purposes as well as to possibly harness their potential for insect vector population control strategies.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d7f12ae8e4c38aa0347c548b70463829ae0dd8cc,d7f12ae8e4c38aa0347c548b70463829ae0dd8cc,"M.

Detection of Trypansoma cruzi in Kissing Bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae) Collected Across Oklahoma,"Abstract Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease in humans and dogs in the Americas. Transmission predominantly occurs via the feces of infected kissing bugs (Hemiptera: family Reduviidae; subfamily Triatominae) contaminating bite site wounds or mucous membranes. To better understand Chagas disease entomologic risk in Oklahoma, kissing bugs collected from within the state were tested for T. cruzi DNA. Data including county of insect collection, species and instar, and specific locations where specimens were found were collated. Triatomines were also tested by PCR to potentially identify DNA of vertebrate species on which specimens had recently fed. In total, 110 kissing bugs from 22 counties were tested. All triatomines were identified as Triatoma sanguisuga nymphs or adults, with the exception of one possible T. lecticularia adult. Trypanosoma cruzi DNA was detected in 22 (20%) triatomines from 12 counties spanning the state. The majority of T. cruzi PCR positive kissing bugs were found inside homes or associated structures (i.e., garages, porches). Vertebrate DNA was identified in 27 (24.5%) triatomines, with human DNA detected in 25 (92.6%) of these specimens, and canine and raccoon DNA detected in one specimen each (3.7%).Two specimens tested positive for both T. cruzi and human DNA and one specimen tested positive for both T. cruzi and raccoon DNA. Results from this study indicate that kissing bugs carrying T. cruzi are widespread in Oklahoma, that positive kissing bugs infest homes and associated structures, and that human-vector, canine-vector, and wildlife-vector contact all occur within the state.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/204883b0bee4ee82a11079d54bfd3e643caf444d,204883b0bee4ee82a11079d54bfd3e643caf444d,"Kelly E.

Dynamics of Triatoma infestans populations in the Paraguayan Chaco: Population genetic analysis of household reinfestation following vector control,"Background Although domestic infestations by Triatoma infestans have been successfully controlled across Latin America, in areas of the Gran Chaco region, recurrent post-spraying house colonization continues to be a significant challenge, jeopardizing Chagas disease vector control and maintaining active Trypanosoma cruzi transmission. Methodology/Principal findings To investigate the dynamics of triatomine reinfestation in a rural area of the Paraguayan Chaco, genetic characterization (based on 10 microsatellite loci and cytochrome B sequence polymorphisms) was performed on baseline and reinfestant T. infestans (n = 138) from four indigenous communities and adjacent sylvatic sites. House quality and basic economic activities were assessed across the four communities. Significant genetic differentiation was detected among all baseline triatomine populations. Faster reinfestation was observed in the communities with higher infestation rates pre-spraying. Baseline and reinfestant populations from the same communities were not genetically different, but two potentially distinct processes of reinfestation were evident. In Campo Largo, the reinfestant population was likely founded by domestic survivor foci, with reduced genetic diversity relative to the baseline population. However, in 12 de Junio, reinfestant bugs were likely derived from different sources, including survivors from the pre-spraying population and sympatric sylvatic bugs, indicative of gene-flow between these habitats, likely driven by high human mobility and economic activities in adjacent sylvatic areas. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that sylvatic T. infestans threatens vector control strategies, either as a reinfestation source or by providing a temporary refuge during insecticide spraying. Passive anthropogenic importation of T. infestans and active human interactions with neighboring forested areas also played a role in recolonization. Optimization of spraying, integrated community development and close monitoring of sylvatic areas should be considered when implementing vector control activities in the Gran Chaco.",2022,9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/553957670d3a4e7963c311532fa3ec412a431a6b,553957670d3a4e7963c311532fa3ec412a431a6b,"A.

"Characteristics and Adverse Events of Patients for Whom Nifurtimox Was Released Through CDC-Sponsored Investigational New Drug Program for Treatment of Chagas Disease — United States, 2001–2021","Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Chagas disease is endemic in rural areas of Latin America, but T. cruzi, triatomine vectors, infected mammalian reservoir hosts, and rare cases of autochthonous vector borne transmission have been reported in the United States (1). Possible modes of transmission include the following: vector borne via skin or mucosal contact with feces of infected triatomine bugs, congenital, blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or laboratory accident. Chagas disease can be treated with benznidazole (commercially available since May 14, 2018) or nifurtimox (2). Before January 25, 2021, nifurtimox (Lampit) had been exclusively available through CDC under an Institutional Review Board-approved Investigational New Drug (IND) treatment protocol, at which time it became reasonably accessible to health care providers outside of the program. This report summarizes CDC Drug Service reports for selected characteristics of and adverse events reported by 336 patients for whom nifurtimox was requested under the CDC IND program during January 1, 2001-January 25, 2021.

"Multidisciplinary approach detects speciation within the kissing bug Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus populations (Hemiptera, Heteroptera, Reduviidae)","BACKGROUND Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus (Hemiptera-Reduviidae) is a triatomine species with a wide geographic distribution and a broad phenotypic variability. In some countries, this species is found infesting and colonising domiciliary ecotopes representing an epidemiological risk factor as a vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, etiological agent of Chagas disease. In spite of this, little is known about P. rufotuberculatus genetic diversity. METHODS Cytogenetic studies and DNA sequence analyses of one nuclear (ITS-2) and two mitochondrial DNA sequences (cyt b and coI) were carried out in P. rufotuberculatus individuals collected in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico. Moreover, a geometric morphometrics study was applied to Bolivian, Colombian, Ecuadorian and French Guiana samples. OBJECTIVES To explore the genetic and phenetic diversity of P. rufotuberculatus from different countries, combining chromosomal studies, DNA sequence analyses and geometric morphometric comparisons. FINDINGS We found two chromosomal groups differentiated by the number of X chromosomes and the chromosomal position of the ribosomal DNA clusters. In concordance, two main morphometric profiles were detected, clearly separating the Bolivian sample from the other ones. Phylogenetic DNA analyses showed that both chromosomal groups were closely related to each other and clearly separated from the remaining Panstrongylus species. High nucleotide divergence of cyt b and coI fragments were observed among P. rufotuberculatus samples from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico (Kimura 2-parameter distances higher than 9%). MAIN CONCLUSIONS Chromosomal and molecular analyses supported that the two chromosomal groups could represent different closely related species. We propose that Bolivian individuals constitute a new Panstrongylus species, being necessary a detailed morphological study for its formal description. The clear morphometric discrimination based on the wing venation pattern suggests such morphological description might be conclusive.",2022,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64cf98ca6909879bc2fa5578f206989c1c5bc958,64cf98ca6909879bc2fa5578f206989c1c5bc958,"S.

Distribution patterns of Triatominae (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in the Americas: an analysis based on networks and endemicity,"Triatominae, commonly known as kissing bugs, are a group of approximately 150 species of hematophagous reduviids, some of which are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of the Chagas disease. Distributional patterns of triatomines have been studied based on macroecological and historical biogeographic approaches, but the definition of distributional patterns and areas of endemism are yet to be defined based on objective criteria. We used two methods to identify biogeographic units in the Triatominae: the endemicity analysis based on an optimality criterion (NDM/VNDM software) and a network approach aimed to simplify and highlight the underlying structure in species distributions (Infomap Bioregions). Information on species distributions was obtained from a data paper, comprising 21 815 records for 135 triatomine species occurring in the Americas. The resulting areas of each method were clustered using a meta consensus criterion based on dissimilarities and interpreted as recurrent areas. The NDM areas show a nested structure, presenting greater restrictions to the inclusion of species in a given area, requiring broad sympatry. In contrast, bioregions emphasize spatial patterns with better‐delimited areas and species occurrences do not need to be highly congruent. When areas were clustered based on their species composition two clear patterns arose from both methods: (i) areas within the southern Amazon and southeast South America, especially in the Chacoan subregion, formed a cluster, and (ii) areas north of the Amazon, Pacific, Mesoamerica, Mexican transition zone and Nearctic formed another cluster. Moreover, within each of these two clusters, there was a latitudinal gradient of the areas in the Americas showing spatial similarity between the areas found in both methods. Results of both methods show well‐bound areas separating the triatomine fauna in the Brazilian subregions, resulting in the recognition of areas corresponding to the biomes Chaco, Pampa, Cerrado, and Caatinga, and, to a lesser extent, the Atlantic Forest.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f990ddd21499a7358bc3e4fe11d65996dd19f941,f990ddd21499a7358bc3e4fe11d65996dd19f941,"A.

Cytochrome P450 Genes of the CYP4 Clan and Pyrethroid Resistance in Chagas Disease Vectors,"Triatomine insects are vectors of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Although residual pyrethroid spraying has been a successful vector control strategy for many years, a growing number of pyrethroid-resistance foci is being documented, mainly in Triatoma infestans, that led to failures in vector elimination. Insecticide resistance is a multifactorial phenomenon that often implies a combination of three different mechanisms: increased insecticide detoxification, reduced affinity of the site of action, and reduced insecticide penetration through the cuticle. All three mechanisms were reported in pyrethroid-resistant T. infestans. Cytochrome P450s are enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous chemicals. They are encoded by CYP genes and classified into different families and clans. In triatomines, the CYP4 clan is divided in two families, CYP3093 and CYP4, and both exhibit genome-wide, triatomine-specific gene expansions. Some members from each family have been reported to be involved in two of the mechanisms mentioned above, i.e., they participate in insecticide detoxification in different organs and tissues, and in the synthesis of cuticular hydrocarbons, which ultimately can contribute to a reduced insecticide penetration. The aim of this manuscript is to review the current state of knowledge of P450 genes belonging to the CYP4 clan in triatomines and to highlight their potential role in insecticide resistance.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7f3aa63601d7966526cc51a18e25a46430d337ab,7f3aa63601d7966526cc51a18e25a46430d337ab,"A.

Life History Data of Dipetalogaster maxima (Hemiptera: Reduviidae),"Abstract Dipetalogaster maxima (Uhler) is a triatomine species that has been found to be infected by Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas in the habitats of the most important tourist areas of Mexico. Its behavior and vectorial capacity have been scarcely studied, although such information is necessary to reliably estimate the importance of this species as a vector of T. cruzi in its distribution area. This study reports biological parameters related to the vectorial capacity of D. maxima. In particular, the egg-to-adult development time, number of blood meals required to molt, accumulative mortality, time to beginning of feeding, feeding and defecation times, fecundity, and fertility were examined. D. maxima took a median of 211 d to develop from egg to adult, requiring 11 meals in total. Almost two-thirds (63%) of specimens died during the cycle. The time to beginning of feeding was 1 min in all instars. Feeding times varied from 14 to 27 min. Most nymphs (except first-instar) defecated when feeding or immediately thereafter. A mean of 0.7 eggs/♀/day was recorded, with an eclosion rate of 27.3%. Five of the eight studied parameters (mainly defecation delay) suggest the remarkable potential vectorial capacity of D. maxima, so it is necessary to maintain permanent surveillance of domiciliary populations of D. maxima, because they may be infected with T. cruzi.

"Triatoma guazu Lent and Wygodzinsky Is a Junior Synonym of Triatoma williami Galvão, Souza and Lima","Simple Summary Triatomines are blood-sucking insects, potential vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Triatoma guazu and Triatoma williami are phylogenetically very close and occur in sympatry. Morphologic, morphometric, and genetic analyses were performed to discuss the taxonomic status of these species. Morphometric and molecular data do not show diagnostic characteristics between species, whereas their different patterns of connexival spots were considered a phenotypic polymorphism, common in triatomines. These results suggest T. guazu as a junior synonym of T. williami. Therefore, the synonym between these species is formally proposed here. Abstract Triatoma guazu Lent and Wygodzinsky and Triatoma williami Galvão, Souza, and Lima (Hemiptera: Triatominae) are found in human dwellings and are potential vectors of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Triatoma guazu was described based solely on a single female specimen, from the municipality of Villarica, Guairá Department, Paraguay, and posteriorly, a male from Barra do Garças, Mato Grosso, Brazil was described and designated as the allotype of this species. Triatoma williami is found in the central-west of Brazil between Goiás, Mato Grosso, and Mato Grosso do Sul. However, the taxonomic “status” of these species is questioned. Previous studies indicate the lack of isoenzymatic diagnostic loci, morphometric similarity, low genetic divergence, and close evolutionary relationship of these species. In this study, we compared the morphology, morphometry, and mitochondrial DNA fragments of the populations of the two species. The morphological diagnostic characteristic among these species is the difference in the connexivum spots pattern, which has been recognized as a phenotypic variation that exists among populations resulting from ecological diversity. Furthermore, our analysis also revealed the morphometric similarity and low genetic divergence between these species. Therefore, in the present paper, we formally propose T. guazu as a junior synonym of T. williami.",2022,24,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9271b04a911619d881326ff87ce12437233a1cf2,9271b04a911619d881326ff87ce12437233a1cf2,"João Paulo Sales Oliveira Correia, H.

"Retrospective study of triatomines in an endemic region for Chagas disease in the state of Bahia, Brazil","Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, which has several forms of transmission. Among them, the vector route requires the constant action of the Health Surveillance in the control of triatomines. Our objective is to describe the diversity of triatomines and the rate of natural infection by T. cruzi in these insects, as well as to analyse entomological indicators, through secondary data generated by the Health Surveillance of the municipality of Barra, in the period from 2009 to 2019. The secondary data were subjected to descriptive analysis and the entomological indicators calculated. Williams’ G test and Fisher’s exact test were used to analyse the categorical data. A total of 10,913 triatomines of the genera Rhodnius sp., Panstrongylus sp., Eratyrus sp. and Triatoma sp. were captured, represented by 12 species. Triatoma sordida was the most prevalent 98.66% (10,767/10,913), reflected in the overall infestation index 7.61% (2,555/33,544) and triatomine density 0.24 (8,247/33,544). While the overall infection rate was 0.81% (41/5,048) and remained low during all years. There was significant association for T. sordida in relation to “T. cruzi infection index” and “Developmental stage” and “Capture site”. It is concluded that the municipality of Barra has a high occurrence of triatomines of various species, with T. sordida being the most prevalent species and responsible for the rates of infestation and infection by T. cruzi. The presence of these insects in households is a risk for the domestic cycle of the parasite, and thus can transmit T. cruzi to various domestic animals, including humans.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46c8a42404d8e25a075ccbf254f569d2030b3d2f,46c8a42404d8e25a075ccbf254f569d2030b3d2f,"Jéssica Samile Sousa Santos, Alini Dias de Pauda, Joane Maíra Cavalcante Braga Novais, Jairo Torres Magalhães Junior, I.

"Collection of triatomines from sylvatic habitats by a Chagas-positive, trained scent-detection canine in Texas, USA","Background Triatomine insects, vectors of the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), are challenging to locate in sylvatic habitats. Collection techniques used in the United States often rely on methods to intercept seasonally dispersing adults or on community scientists’ encounters. Neither method is suited for detecting nidicolous habitats, which is important for vector control. Furthermore, manual inspection of suspected harborages is unlikely to reveal novel locations and host associations. Similar to a team that used a trained dog to detect sylvatic triatomines in Paraguay, we worked with a trained scent detection dog to detect sylvatic locations of triatomines across Texas. Principle methodology/Findings Ziza, a 3-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer previously naturally infected with T. cruzi, was trained to detect triatomines. Over the course of 6 weeks in the fall of 2017, the dog and her handler visited 18 sites across Texas. The dog detected 60 triatomines at 7 locations; an additional 50 triatomines were contemporaneously collected at these sites without the assistance of the dog. Approximately 0.98 triatomines per hour were found when only humans were conducting searches; when working with the dog, approximately 1.71 triatomines per hour were found. In total, 3 adults and 107 nymphs of four species (Triatoma gerstaeckeri, Triatoma protracta, Triatoma sanguisuga, and Triatoma indictiva) were collected. PCR testing of a subset revealed T. cruzi infection, including DTUs TcI and TcIV, in 28% of nymphs (n=100) and 66% of adults (n=3). Blood meal analysis of a subset of triatomines (n=5) revealed feeding on Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus) and eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus). Conclusion/Significance A trained scent detection dog enhanced triatomine detections in sylvatic habitats. This approach is especially effective at detecting triatomine nymphs and nidicolous locations. With new knowledge of specific sylvatic habitats and key hosts fed upon by triatomines, there are opportunities for continued exploration of novel vector control methods to block the transmission of T. cruzi to humans and domestic animals. Author summary Triatomine insects, also known as ‘kissing bugs,’ are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease in humans, dogs, and other mammals. Triatomines are found throughout the Americas, but little is known about where these blood-sucking insects spend their early life stages. Knowing more is important to vector control initiatives aimed at interrupting Chagas disease transmission. Scent detection dogs have been trained to detect many pests, including one study of a triatomine detection dog in South America. In this study, we used a dog to detect triatomines in their natural environments throughout Texas. Over 6 weeks, the dog identified 60 triatomines at 7 different locations; an additional 50 triatomines were collected without the dog’s assistance. Nearly twice as many triatomines were collected per hour when the dog was searching as compared to only humans searching. Of all the triatomine nymphs collected, 28% were positive for T. cruzi, and the blood meal analysis revealed kissing bugs had fed on Southern plains woodrat, opossum, and eastern cottontail. This study outlines a strategy that can be replicated in the United States to enhance the detection and control of habitats where triatomines spend their early life stages.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/81653bf4e4d8fbc558f1477075736402f279760a,81653bf4e4d8fbc558f1477075736402f279760a,"Devin M.

Chagas: The Silent Disease,"Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. An estimated 6 to 7 million people worldwide are infected with T. cruzi. Chagas disease is found mainly in endemic areas of 21 continental Latin American countries, where it is mostly transmitted when humans come into contact with faeces and/or urine of infected blood-sucking triatomine bugs (vector-borne transmission)1. Chagas disease is named after the Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, who discovered the disease in 19092. Trypanosoma cruzi infection is curable if treatment is initiated soon after infection. In chronic patients, antiparasitic treatment can potentially prevent or curb disease progression and prevent transmission. Chagas disease patients are at risk of severe COVID-19 manifestations and should be a priority group to be vaccinated because the SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocarditis and the chronic Chagas disease typically originates a pro-thrombotic status, cardiac alterations and secondary thrombotic strokes3.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ee7df05fa5dabba8ed87573365188af098a50a9,1ee7df05fa5dabba8ed87573365188af098a50a9,Shanees.

"Different profiles and epidemiological scenarios: past, present and future","The multiplicity of epidemiological scenarios shown by Chagas Disease, derived from multiple transmission routes of the aetiological agent, occurring on multiple geo-ecobiosocial settings determines the complexity of the disease and reveal the difficulties for its control. From the first description of the link between the parasite, the vector and its domestic habitat and the disease that Carlos Chagas made in 1909, the epidemiological scenarios of the American Trypanosomiasis has shown a dynamic increasing complexity. These scenarios changed with time and geography because of new understandings of the disease from multiple studies, because of policies change at the national and international levels and because human movements brought the parasite and vectors to new geographies. Paradigms that seemed solid at a time were broken down, and we learnt about the global dispersion of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, the multiplicity of transmission routes, that the infection can be cured, and that triatomines are not only a health threat in Latin America. We consider the multiple epidemiological scenarios through the different T. cruzi transmission routes, with or without the participation of a Triatominae vector. We then consider the scenario of regions with vectors without the parasite, to finish with the consideration of future prospects.",2022,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6fa054fae70d4da8b61fb20fb23cb95476c59853,6fa054fae70d4da8b61fb20fb23cb95476c59853,"D.

Chagas Disease Expands Its Epidemiological Frontiers From Rural to Urban Areas,"The infection with the hemoflagellate parasite Trypanosoma cruzi originates from America where the wildlife cycle remains to alternate between mammals and hematophagous triatomines. Transmission through contamination of the bite site by vector feces containing highly infectious forms of parasite or direct ingestion of T. cruzi-infected triatomines appear to be the dominant transmission mechanisms. Man joins the transmission when he enters this wild environment or takes the leaves of palms carrying vectors to build houses. Rural Chagas disease develops associated with populations of low economic resources, with infection and reinfection of vector bites since childhood, and the consequent evolution toward chronic cases in adults, when there is little therapeutic benefit to infected people. The progressive migration of people from rural to urban areas and the adaptation of vectors to the peripheries of cities due to displacement caused by deforestation or urbanization that has favored the presence of enzootic cycles with Panstrongylus geniculatus as the most widely distributed species and mammals (synanthropic and domestic) allow vector transmission by ingestion of food contaminated with excrements containing infectious trypomastigotes as the dominant transmission mechanism in the urban environment. Human-to-human transmissions through vertical mother–child infection, transfusions, organ transplants, and the possibility of sexual transmission, transform the epidemiology and the clinical evolution of Chagas disease in the urban environment. Vectors of American trypanosomiasis are no longer restricted to the endemic area, but its presence has been demonstrated in nonendemic areas of the United States, Asia, and other latitudes. The worldwide plague of bedbugs (Cimex lectularius) threatens the possibility of expansion of transmission since they are vectors susceptible to infection, transmission to mammals, trans-stadial penetration, and not being affected by T. cruzi infection at least experimentally. These factors, added to the presence of an unknown number of migrating Latin American asymptomatic carriers together with the presence of triatomines in other continents, have initiated the globalization of a pathology originating in the American continent. Only with an integrative approach, based on new and better tolerated and efficient drugs, vaccines and residual action insecticides, all of them included in an epidemiological surveillance program.",2022,6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/90205472a4d823fdb813ab53ac285da2c1d15fcc,90205472a4d823fdb813ab53ac285da2c1d15fcc,"B.

"Pyrethroid-Resistant and Susceptible Triatoma infestans (Klug, 1834) (Hemiptera, Triatominae): Analysis of Their Vectorial Characteristics by Metacyclogenesis, Feeding/Defecation Patterns, and Parasite Load","Populations of Triatomas infestans with different susceptibility to pyrethroid insecticides were reported to have distinct evolutionary and epidemiological characteristics. We aimed at evaluating metacyclogenesis and parasite load as measures of vector competence and feeding/defecation patterns as vectorial capacity estimates of a group of resistant (“R”) and susceptible (“S”) T. infestans. Third instar nymphs of each group were fed on mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi (Tulahuén strain, DTU VI). Parasite concentration in blood was quantified by real-time PCR (qPCR) for each mouse. The time at which feeding started, the span of feeding, the volume of blood consumed, and the time taken to defecate were measured. At 30 days post-feeding, feces were analyzed in parallel by optical microscopy (percentage of metacyclic trypomastigotes, % MT), and qPCR (total T. cruzi DNA). The ratio of parasites consumed/defecated by nymphs of each group was used to estimate the parasites’ survival and multiplication inside the triatomines’ gut. It was estimated that for each blood trypomastigote consumed, 6.6 parasites were obtained in the feces of “R” nymphs, and 7.9 in “S”. “R” nymphs consumed a higher volume of blood, had lower % MT in their feces (lower vectorial competence), and took longer to defecate (lower vectorial capacity) than “S”.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d36b352be6650a076c60a5d08ff4abc4f973327f,d36b352be6650a076c60a5d08ff4abc4f973327f,"Andrea Paola Guanuco, C.

"Laboratory Evaluation and Field Feasibility of Micro-Encapsulated Insecticide Effect on Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma dimidiata Mortality in Rural Households in Boyacá, Colombia","Simple Summary Vector control strategies need to adapt due to the increase in insecticide resistance among several vector species. Insecticide spraying requires great economic and logistical efforts due to repeated application every six months. This study evaluated the feasibility of micro-encapsulated insecticide on mortality on Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma dimidiata and its effect on household colonization after one year application in a rural community in Colombia. Findings suggest the ability of this paint to prevent colonization and demonstrated positive population perception. Complementary use of insecticide spraying and micro-encapsulated paints suggest this could be a more efficient public health approach that could reduce costs and logistical efforts. Abstract Chagas disease is a neglected vector-borne zoonosis caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi that is primarily transmitted by insects of the subfamily Triatominae. Although control efforts targeting domestic infestations of Rhodnius prolixus have been largely successful, with several regions in Boyacá department certified free of T. cruzi transmission by intradomicile R. prolixus, novel native species are emerging, increasing the risk of disease. Triatoma dimidiata is the second most important species in Colombia, and conventional control methods seem to be less effective. In this study we evaluated the efficacy and usefulness of micro-encapsulated insecticide paints in laboratory conditions and its applicability in rural communities to avoid triatomine domiciliation. Laboratory conditions measured mortality at 6 months and 12 months, with an average mortality between 93–100% for T. dimidiata and 100% for R. prolixus. Evaluation of triatomine infestation in rural households was measured after one year, with an overall perception of effectiveness in reducing household domiciliation. Although triatomines were still spotted inside and around the homes, our findings demonstrate the ability of micro-encapsulated insecticide to prevent colonization inside the households when comparing infestation rates from previous years. Current control measures suggest insecticide spraying every six months, which implies great economic cost and logistical effort. Complementary triatomine control measures with insecticide spraying and micro-encapsulated insecticide paint would make public health efforts more efficient and reduce the frequency of treatment.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e4f0ad0b3bd4b69476482b62857ba099fd94541,2e4f0ad0b3bd4b69476482b62857ba099fd94541,"Lídia Gual-Gonzalez, M.

"Entomological surveillance of Chagas disease in the East of Minas Gerais region, Brazil.","ABSTRACT Background: After decentralizing the actions of the Chagas Disease Control Program (CDCP) in Brazil, municipalities were now responsible for control measures against this endemic, supervised by the Regional Health Superintendencies (RHS). We aimed to evaluate the recent entomological surveillance of Chagas disease in the Regional Health Superintendence of Governador Valadares (RHS/GV) from 2014 to 2019. Methods: Triatomines captured by residents during entomological surveillance were sent to the reference laboratory, where the species and evolutionary stages were identified, place of capture, and presence of Trypanosoma cruzi. A database was created, and the following were calculated: the rate of infection by T. cruzi (overall rate and rate by species), monthly seasonality, spatial distribution of species, number of captures, and infected triatomines/health microregions. Results: We identified 1,708 insects; 1,506 (88.2%) were triatomines, most were adult instars (n=1,469), and few were nymphs (n=37). The identified species were Triatoma vitticeps, Panstrongylus megistus, Panstrongylus diasi, Rhodnius neglectus, and Panstrongylus geniculatus. The first three were most frequently captured and distributed throughout the study area. Most bugs were captured intradomicile (72.5%), mainly in the second semester, between September and November, with an average infection rate of 41.5% (predominantly T. vitticeps, 49.2%).

"High Parasitic Loads Quantified in Sylvatic Triatoma melanica, a Chagas Disease Vector","Triatoma melanica is a sylvatic vector species in Brazil. In We aimed to characterize the Trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs), the parasitic loads, and the blood meal sources of insects collected in rocky outcrops in rural areas in the state of Minas Gerais. An optical microscope (OM) and kDNA-PCR were used to examine natural infection by T. cruzi, and positive samples were genotyped by conventional multilocus PCR. Quantification of the T. cruzi load was performed using qPCR, and the blood meal sources were identified by Sanger sequencing the 12S rRNA gene. A total of 141 T. melanica were captured. Of these, ~55% (61/111) and ~91% (63/69) were positive by OM and KDNA-PCR, respectively. We genotyped ~89% (56/63) of the T. cruzi-positive triatomines, with TcI (~55%, 31/56) being the most prevalent DTU, followed by TcIII (~20%, 11/56) and TcII (~7%, 4/56). Only TcI+TcIII mixed infections were detected in 10 (~18%) specimens. A wide range of variation in the parasitic loads of T. melanica was observed, with an overall median value of 104 parasites/intestine, with females having higher T. cruzi loads than N2, N4, and N5. TcII showed lower parasitic loads compared to TcI and TcIII. The OM positive diagnosis odds ratio between T. cruzi infection when the parasite load is 107 compared to 103 was approximately 29.1. The most frequent blood meal source was Kerodon rupestris (~58%), followed by Thrichomys apereoides (~18%), Wiedomys cerradensis (~8%), Galactis cuja (~8%) and Gallus gallus (~8%).

"Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Chemical Control for Chagas Disease Vectors in Loja Province, Ecuador","The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of selective and community-wide house insecticide spraying in controlling triatomines in the subtropical areas of Loja Province, Ecuador. We designed a quasi-experimental pre–post-test without a control group to compare entomological levels before and after spraying. The baseline study was conducted in 2008. Second, third, and fourth visits were conducted in 2010, 2011, and 2012 in three rural communities. Out of the 130 domestic units (DU) visited, 41 domestic units were examined in each of the four visits. Selective and community-wide insecticide interventions included spraying with 5% deltamethrin at 25 mg/m2 active ingredient. At each visit, a questionnaire was administered to identify the characteristics of households, and DUs were searched for triatomine bugs. In addition, parasitological analysis was carried out in life triatomines. One and two rounds of selective insecticide spraying decreased the probability of infestation by 62% (pairwise odds ratios [POR] 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17–0.89, p = 0.024) and 51% (POR 0.49, 95% CI 0.23–1.01, p = 0.054), respectively. A similar effect was observed after one round of community-wide insecticide application in Chaquizhca and Guara (POR 0.55, CI 0.24–1.25, p = 0.155) and Bellamaria (POR 0.62, CI 0.22–1.79, p = 0.379); however, it was not statistically significant. Trypanosoma cruzi infection in triatomines (n = 483) increased overtime, from 2008 (42.9% and 8.5% for Rhodnius ecuadoriensis and Panstrongylus chinai, respectively) to 2012 (79.5% and 100%). Neither of the two spraying methodologies was effective for triatomine control in this area and our results point to a high likelihood of reinfestation after insecticide application. This underscores the importance of the implementation of physical barriers that prevent invasion and colonization of triatomines in households, such as home improvement initiatives, accompanied by a concerted effort to address the underlying socioeconomic issues that keep this population at risk of developing Chagas disease.",2022,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7e1b22c52eff2b1e71f67ebd9d004ac61e0c8d86,7e1b22c52eff2b1e71f67ebd9d004ac61e0c8d86,"M.
