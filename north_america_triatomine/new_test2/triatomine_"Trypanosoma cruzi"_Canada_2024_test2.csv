"Prevalence and Diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in Triatomine Vectors and Their Blood Meal Sources from South Central Texas, USA","Simple Summary Chagas disease is endemic to the state of Texas in the United States but does not have consistent surveillance or reporting. We utilized multiple sampling sites and different species of triatomine to gain data on the blood meal sources found by DNA testing for the host and vector species identities. From domestic, peridomestic, and rural sites, we found a breadth of blood meal origins including mammals, chickens, and reptiles. Unique non-native taxa utilized for blood meals enabled us to also report on extensive foraging distances for the vectors. Understanding the diversity of blood meal sources and the distances the vectors travel between meals and daytime refuges are both important aspects for understanding the spread of this disease. Abstract The prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi was assessed in 117 triatomine insects from central Texas. The qPCR-based results revealed T. cruzi in 59% of the insects (62 adults and eight nymphs), with overall prevalences of T. cruzi of 0% (0/9), 64% (11/17), 58% (10/17), 73% (30/41), and 57% (19/33) for the Bastrop, Caldwell, Gonzales, Guadalupe, and Hays counties, respectively. Analyses of 18S rRNA fragments confirmed T. cuzi in 81% of these samples. Vectors were identified as Triatoma gerstaeckeri (35% of which 65% were positive for T. cruzi), T. sanguisuga (21%, 43% positive), and Paratriatoma leticularia (0.3%, 100% positive). Food sources were recovered from 29% of the insects. Raccoons were 53% of the blood meals (83% positive for T. cruzi), while the remainder came from a variety of sources, including humans (33% positive), house geckos, Eastern woodrats, plain-bellied water snakes (50% positive), hispid cotton rats (0% positive), chickens (100% positive); Asian forest turtles, bison, and pigs (0% positive). The serendipitous detection of blood meal sources at known minimum distances from the collection of the vector insect enabled us to provide several instances where the insect foraging distance was greater than 400 m. These vector foraging distances are novel information that can assist in our understanding of the landscape dynamics for the spread of the pathogen.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2576777420e5679266daee09fb131ac109752017,2576777420e5679266daee09fb131ac109752017,"Rebecca J.

Triatomine vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi in an endemic area for Chagas disease in Northeast Brazil,"ABSTRACT Background: We assessed the distribution of triatomines in an endemic area for Chagas disease. Methods: This retrospective study used secondary data extracted from the Official System of the National Chagas Disease Control Program (Sistema Oficial do Programa Nacional de Controle da Doença de Chagas - SisPCDCh). Results: A total of 7,257 (725.7 ± 221.7 per year) specimens were collected from 2013 to 2022. Most of them (6,792; 93.6%) were collected in the intradomicile and 465 (6.4%) in the peridomicile. A total of 513 (7.1%) triatomines tested positive for the presence of trypomastigote forms, similar to Trypanosoma cruzi. Conclusions: The spatial analysis revealed a heterogeneous distribution of triatomines across different municipalities.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5ccc73b4ef90d0b6d372cb51d10edea7d74d4171,5ccc73b4ef90d0b6d372cb51d10edea7d74d4171,"José Atanásio de Oliveira Neto, Daniela Bandeira Anastácio, T.

Lessons to be popular: the chemical basis of aggregation in Trypanosoma cruzi-infected and non-infected Chagasic bugs,"Aggregation is one of the most remarkable behaviours in the animal kingdom—a process that is usually governed by pheromones. Triatomines are blood-sucking bugs that act as vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease in mammals, including humans. Triatomines usually gather in roosting refuges by using aggregation pheromones of unknown chemical structure. In terms of vector control, one option to reduce triatomine–human contact is via capturing the insects into traps baited with lures based on such aggregation pheromones. As a first step towards this aim, we elucidated the aggregation pheromone in the triatomine Triatoma pallidipennis, using T. cruzi-infected and non-infected bugs. We used different extraction techniques and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry for the identification. Also, two different bioassays were implemented for evaluating the attractant and arrestant activity of the pheromone. We found that T. pallidipennis produced short-chain aldehydes as attractants, and nitrogen-derived compounds as arrestants. We detected differences in the production and perception of these compounds according to whether animals were infected or not. These findings show that T. cruzi may influence triatomine chemical ecology and are promising tools for triatomine control.",2024,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/391f1a73a43420d2bcdd6fc71fddcb96f4032bf8,391f1a73a43420d2bcdd6fc71fddcb96f4032bf8,"D.

Detection and Genotyping of Trypanosoma cruzi Samples in Species of Genus Rhodnius from Different Environments in the Brazilian Amazon.,"Background: In the Amazon region, several species of triatomines occur in the natural environments. Among them, species of the genus Rhodnius are a risk to human populations due to their high rates of infection with Trypanosoma cruzi. The aim of this study was to identify the T. cruzi genotypes in Rhodnius specimens and their relationship with sylvatic hosts from different environments in the Brazilian Amazon. Methods: A total of 492 triatomines were collected from the municipalities of Monte Negro, Rondônia state, and Humaitá, Amazonas state, 382 of them being nymphs and 110 adults. Genotyping of T. cruzi in six discrete typing units (DTUs) was performed using conventional multilocus PCR. The triatomines that were positive for T. cruzi and engorged with blood were also targeted for amplification of the cytochrome B (cytB) gene to identify bloodmeal sources. Results: Of the 162 positive samples, the identified DTUs were TcI (87.65%) and TcIV (12.35%). It was observed that 102 specimens were engorged with a variety of bloodmeals. Triatomines infected with TcI were associated with DNA of all identified vertebrates, except Plecturocebus brunneus. TcIV was detected in triatomines that fed on Coendou prehensilis, Didelphis marsupialis, Mabuya nigropunctata, P. brunneus, Pithecia irrorata, Sapajus apella, and Tamandua tetradactyla. Conclusion: Results highlight the need to understand the patterns of T. cruzi genotypes in Rhodnius spp. and their association with sylvatic hosts to better elucidate their role in the transmission of Chagas disease in the Amazon region.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/376667c8789747325e7241fe7b2a4e7d9777bcb1,376667c8789747325e7241fe7b2a4e7d9777bcb1,"Adriana Benatti Bilheiro, G.

Branched chain amino acids modulate the proteomic profile of Pro-induced differentiation for the infective stages of Trypanosoma cruzi,"Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, undergoes a complex life cycle involving triatomine insects as vectors and mammals. The differentiation of epimastigote forms into metacyclic trypomastigotes within the insect vector is crucial for the parasite’s life cycle progression. Factors influencing this process, including temperature, pH, and nutritional stress, along with specific metabolite availability, play a pivotal role. Amino acids like Pro, His, and Gln support cell differentiation, while branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) inhibit it. Interestingly, combining the pro-metacyclogenic amino acid Pro with one of the anti-metacyclogenic BCAAs results in viable metacyclics with significantly reduced infectivity. To explore the characteristics of metacyclic parasites differentiated in the presence of BCAAs, proteomics analyses were conducted. Metacyclics obtained in triatomine artificial urine (TAU) supplemented with Pro alone and in combination with Leu, Ile, or Val were compared. The analyses revealed differential regulation of 40 proteins in TAU-Pro-Leu, 131 in TAU-Pro-Ile, and 179 in TAU-Pro-Val, as compared to metacyclics from TAU-Pro. Among these, 22%, 11%, and 13% of the proteins were associated with metabolic processes, respectively. Notably, enzymes related to glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were reduced in metacyclics with Pro-BCAAs, while enzymes involved in amino acid and purine metabolic pathways were increased. Furthermore, metacyclics with Pro-Ile and Pro-Val exhibited elevated enzymes linked to lipid and redox metabolism. These findings suggest that the presence of BCAAs can reshape the metabolism of metacyclics, contributing to the observed reduction in infectivity in these parasites.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c884e97bd2dc1420146f0adcdb89f1bda935a7e7,c884e97bd2dc1420146f0adcdb89f1bda935a7e7,"Janaina de Freitas Nascimento, F.

"Transmission ecology of Trypanosoma cruzi by Rhodnius prolixus (Reduviidae: Triatominae) infesting palm-tree species in the Colombian Orinoco, indicates risks to human populations","Background Chagas disease, affecting approximately eight million individuals in tropical regions, is primarily transmitted by vectors. Rhodnius prolixus, a triatomine vector, commonly inhabits in ecotopes with diverse palm tree species, creating optimal conditions for vector proliferation. This study aims to explore the transmission ecology of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative parasite of Chagas disease, by investigating the feeding patterns and natural infection rates of R. prolixus specimens collected from various wild palm species in the Colombian Orinoco region. Materials and methods To achieve this objective, we sampled 35 individuals from three palm species (Attalea butyracea, Acrocomia aculeata, and Mauritia flexuosa) in a riparian forest in the Casanare department of eastern Colombia, totaling 105 sampled palm trees. DNA was extracted and analyzed from 115 R. prolixus specimens at different developmental stages using quantitative PCR (qPCR) for T. cruzi detection and identification of discrete typing units. Feeding preferences were determined by sequencing the 12S rRNA gene amplicon through next-generation sequencing. Results A total of 676 R. prolixus specimens were collected from the sampled palms. The study revealed variation in population densities and developmental stages of R. prolixus among palm tree species, with higher densities observed in A. butyracea and lower densities in M. flexuosa. TcI was the exclusive T. cruzi discrete typing unit (DTU) found, with infection frequency positively correlated with R. prolixus abundance. Insects captured in A. butyracea exhibited higher abundance and infection rates than those from other palm species. The feeding sources comprised 13 mammal species, showing no significant differences between palm species in terms of blood sources. However, Didelphis marsupialis and Homo sapiens were present in all examined R. prolixus, and Dasypus novemcinctus was found in 89.47% of the insects. Conclusion This study highlights the significance of wild palms, particularly A. butyracea, as a substantial risk factor for T. cruzi transmission to humans in these environments. High population densities and infection rates of R. prolixus were observed in each examined palm tree species.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ffadaa5a8528db85bf27509684c6b4d125aa0055,ffadaa5a8528db85bf27509684c6b4d125aa0055,"P.

First Report of Seropositivity to Trypanosoma cruzi in Mexican Afro-Descendants from Guerrero and Oaxaca States,"Mexican Afro-descendant is a population poorly studied in many aspects, between them the infectious diseases that they suffer. This population is mainly found in the country's Pacific (Oaxaca and Guerrero states) and Atlantic (Veracruz) coast. In these regions, a diversity of triatomine vectors of the Chagas disease is found. Also, all the genotypes of Trypanosoma cruzi DTUs have been reported. That is why the present study aimed to study the presence of antibodies against T. cruzi and cardiac pathology associated with the Chagas disease in the Mexican Afro-descendant population of Guerrero and Oaxaca. ELISA, Western blot, and recombinant antigen's ELISA were used to evaluate the seropositivity of these communities. Furthermore, an electrocardiographic study and evaluation of risk factors associated with T. cruzi infection in the Oaxaca and Guerrero populations were conducted. 26.77% of the analyzed population was positive for two serological tests. These percentages are higher than the previously reported for the mestizo population in similar studies. Electrocardiographic results showed cardiac disorder associated with the Chagas disease in the population. Also, risk factors were identified associated with the men's activities in the outdoor working areas.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf626ae0f6e8462081535724997c0c4bc60ad9a2,bf626ae0f6e8462081535724997c0c4bc60ad9a2,"B.

The risk of vector transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi remains high in the State of Paraná,"BACKGROUND Monitoring and analysing the infection rates of the vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, that causes Chagas disease, helps assess the risk of transmission. OBJECTIVES A study was carried out on triatomine in the State of Paraná, Brazil, between 2012 and 2021 and a comparison was made with a previous study. This was done to assess the risk of disease transmission. METHODS Ecological niche models based on climate and landscape variables were developed to predict habitat suitability for the vectors as a proxy for risk of occurrence. FINDINGS A total of 1,750 specimens of triatomines were recorded, of which six species were identified. The overall infection rate was 22.7%. The areas with the highest risk transmission of T. cruzi are consistent with previous predictions in municipalities. New data shows that climate models are more accurate than landscape models. This is likely because climate suitability was higher in the previous period. MAIN CONCLUSION Regardless of uneven sampling and potential biases, risk remains high due to the wide presence of infected vectors and high environmental suitability for vector species throughout the state and, therefore, improvements in public policies aimed at wide dissemination of knowledge about the disease are recommended to ensure the State remains free of Chagas disease.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae4cb9459916c9b49f0555b8b9852b4ea8c01756,ae4cb9459916c9b49f0555b8b9852b4ea8c01756,"J.

First Report of Chagas Disease Vector Species Triatoma sanguisuga (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) Infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in Delaware,"ABSTRACT. In July and October 2023, two live triatomine bugs were found inside a home in New Castle County, Delaware. The bugs were identified as Triatoma sanguisuga, the most widespread triatomine bug species in the United States. Triatoma sanguisuga is a competent vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The two specimens were tested via real-time PCR (qPCR) for infection with T. cruzi, and one of the specimens was positive. Despite T. sanguisuga being endemic to the area, attainment of accurate species identification and T. cruzi testing of the bugs required multiple calls to federal, state, private, and academic institutions over several months. This constitutes the first report of T. sanguisuga infected with T. cruzi in Delaware. In addition, this is the first published report of T. sanguisuga in New Castle County, the northernmost and most densely populated county in Delaware. New Castle County still conforms to the described geographic range of T. sanguisuga, which spans from Texas to the East Coast of the United States. The T. cruzi infection prevalence of the species has not been studied in the northeastern United States, but collections in southern states have found prevalences as high as 60%. The Delaware homeowner’s lengthy pursuit of accurate information about the vector highlights the need for more research on this important disease vector in Delaware.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6eea8f8e7462f73401ae4afe11fbdc70e0d80d87,6eea8f8e7462f73401ae4afe11fbdc70e0d80d87,"Jennifer K.

The importance of estimating the burden of disease from foodborne transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi,"Chagas disease (ChD), caused by infection with the flagellated protozoan, Trypanosoma cruzi, has a complicated transmission cycle with many infection routes. These include vector-borne (via the triatomine (reduviid bug) vector defecating into a skin abrasion, usually following a blood meal), transplacental transmission, blood transfusion, organ transplant, laboratory accident, and foodborne transmission. Foodborne transmission may occur due to ingestion of meat or blood from infected animals or from ingestion of other foods (often fruit juice) contaminated by infected vectors or secretions from reservoir hosts. Despite the high disease burden associated with ChD, it was omitted from the original World Health Organization estimates of foodborne disease burden that were published in 2015. As these estimates are currently being updated, this review presents arguments for including ChD in new estimates of the global burden of foodborne disease. Preliminary calculations suggest a burden of at least 137,000 Disability Adjusted Life Years, but this does not take into account the greater symptom severity associated with foodborne transmission. Thus, we also provide information regarding the greater health burden in endemic areas associated with foodborne infection compared with vector-borne infection, with higher mortality and more severe symptoms. We therefore suggest that it is insufficient to use source attribution alone to determine the foodborne proportion of current burden estimates, as this may underestimate the higher disability and mortality associated with the foodborne infection route.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c35ae6fb2950d7e80fdcd99249b8db4fd0a982ad,c35ae6fb2950d7e80fdcd99249b8db4fd0a982ad,"Lucy J.

Clonagem e caracterização do gene que codifica a proteína de choque térmico HSP83 do Trypanosoma cruzi,"[Objective] Trypanosoma cruzi, a causal agent of Chagas’ disease, is a parasite whose life cycle alternates between an invertebrate (triatomine) and a vertebrate (mammal) host. Various studies have shown that in T. cruzi, HSP83 (a homolog of HSP90) is essential for cell division and control of the response to thermal stress. This investigation focused on studying the cloning, bioinformatic characterization, and expression of the heat shock protein HSP83 T. cruzi gene for further cell signaling studies. [Methodology] RNA was extracted from T. cruzi epimastigotes (EPm6 clone, MHOM/VE/2007/ 6c) using a commercial kit. The cDNA encoding HSP83 was determined using RT-PCR on extracted mRNA, for which the primers were designed based on the HSP83 sequence of T. cruzi strain CL Brener. Cloning was performed using pGEM®T-Easy and subcloned into the expression vector pQE30. Sequence and bioinformatic characterization were performed. The gene was expressed, and the recombinant protein was purified using affinity chromatography and identified through immunoblotting. [Results] Sequence analysis showed similarity to the gene encoding HSP83 from Trypanosoma cruzi, and HSP domains and B epitopes in the sequence were also observed. After 3 hours of induction with IPTG, a recombinant protein with an approximate weight of 83 kDa was obtained. The immunoblotting reaction with hyperimmune anti-T. cruzi epimastigote serum helped detect a single band with a molecular weight of nearly 83 kDa. [Conclusions] All results indicate that the cloning and characterization of HSP83 from Trypanosoma cruzi was achieved.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/71a3115e96d616e745f5e3a88b68d1df2e20253e,71a3115e96d616e745f5e3a88b68d1df2e20253e,"Ana Fernández, Ana Rita De Lima, Elizabeth Ferrer"
Genetic Diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in the United States of America: The Least Endemic Country for Chagas Disease,"Chagas disease (CD), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and endemic in Latin America, has become an emergent health problem in non-endemic countries due to human migration. The United States (US) is the non-Latin American country with the highest CD burden and cannot be considered as non-endemic, since triatomine vectors and reservoir animals have been found. Populations of T. cruzi are divided into genetic subdivisions, which are known as discrete typing units (DTUs): TcI to TcVI and TcBat. Autochthonous human T. cruzi infection in the US is sporadic, but it may change due to environmental factors affecting the geographic distribution of triatomines. We aimed to perform a literature review of the genetic diversity of T. cruzi in triatomine vectors and mammalian hosts, including human cases, in the US. The 34 analyzed studies revealed the presence of T. cruzi in 18 states, which was mainly concentrated in Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. TcI and TcIV were the principal DTUs identified, being TcI the most genotyped (42.4%; 917/2164). This study represents a first attempt to compile the molecular epidemiology of T. cruzi in the US, which is fundamental for predicting the progression of the infection in the country and could be of great help in its future management.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db8eb16c17632cde118446a8a08b9e98bbcd87c6,db8eb16c17632cde118446a8a08b9e98bbcd87c6,"Arnau Llovera, Alba Abras, A.

Development and survival of Triatoma barberi and Triatoma longipennis (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) is affected by Trypanosoma cruzi colonization,"Triatomines are insect vectors of the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This occurs when the triatomine defecates on the skin of the vertebrate host when it bites its host for feeding. This lesion causes the penetration of T. cruzi, whose infective phase is the tripomastigote, and the non-infective replicative phase epimastigote. Although the effects of T. cruzi on the development and survival of different species of triatomine bugs are known, it has not been fully described how the parasite affects many of the species that inhabit Mexico. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of the presence of T. cruzi on triatomine development and survival. For this, five triatomines of each instar of each species, Triatoma barberi and Triatoma longipennis, were inoculated, from their second instar to their adult stage, female or male. Each triatomine was infected with 3-5 x105 parasites and they were incubated for 100 days and the kinetic of parasites in the feces and T. cruzi phases were recorded. The results showed that T. barberi and T. longipennis development was affected in all stages because of T. cruzi infection. It was greater for T. longipennis, both in its mortality, as well as time to molt in each phase.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4737194bacbbac08f5fa33cac2270f118caf1583,4737194bacbbac08f5fa33cac2270f118caf1583,"M.

"Interaction of Trypanosoma cruzi, Triatomines and the Microbiota of the Vectors—A Review","This review summarizes the interactions between Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, its vectors, triatomines, and the diverse intestinal microbiota of triatomines, which includes mutualistic symbionts, and highlights open questions. T. cruzi strains show great biological heterogeneity in their development and their interactions. Triatomines differ from other important vectors of diseases in their ontogeny and the enzymes used to digest blood. Many different bacteria colonize the intestinal tract of triatomines, but only Actinomycetales have been identified as mutualistic symbionts. Effects of the vector on T. cruzi are indicated by differences in the ability of T. cruzi to establish in the triatomines and in colonization peculiarities, i.e., proliferation mainly in the posterior midgut and rectum and preferential transformation into infectious metacyclic trypomastigotes in the rectum. In addition, certain forms of T. cruzi develop after feeding and during starvation of triatomines. Negative effects of T. cruzi on the triatomine vectors appear to be particularly evident when the triatomines are stressed and depend on the T. cruzi strain. Effects on the intestinal immunity of the triatomines are induced by ingested blood-stage trypomastigotes of T. cruzi and affect the populations of many non-symbiotic intestinal bacteria, but not all and not the mutualistic symbionts. After the knockdown of antimicrobial peptides, the number of non-symbiotic bacteria increases and the number of T. cruzi decreases. Presumably, in long-term infections, intestinal immunity is suppressed, which supports the growth of specific bacteria, depending on the strain of T. cruzi. These interactions may provide an approach to disrupt T. cruzi transmission.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/787e033f1c98eb3e324b62bfd4b68c30674885d4,787e033f1c98eb3e324b62bfd4b68c30674885d4,
Domestic Dog Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi from Northern and Southern Regions of Mexico.,"Background: Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and vectored by triatomines, affects millions of people worldwide. In endemic countries including Mexico, infections in domestic animals, such as dogs, may affect the risk of human disease when they serve as a source of infection to vectors that subsequently infect humans. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 296 dogs from two cities near the northern and southern borders of Mexico: Reynosa, Tamaulipas, and Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas. Infection was measured based on testing of blood using T. cruzi quantitative PCR (qPCR) and up to three antibody detection assays. The StatPak immunochromatographic assay was used to screen samples and the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) and multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MIA) tests were used as secondary tests on all samples that screened positive and a subset of negatives. Serologic positivity was defined based on reactivity on at least two independent tests. Results: Of the 280 samples tested for parasite DNA, two (0.7%) were positive, one of which (0.4%) was confirmed as T. cruzi discrete typing unit TcIV. Overall, 72 (24.3%) samples were reactive for T. cruzi antibodies via StatPak of which 8 were also positive using MIA and 2 were also positive using IFA (including one of the PCR-positive dogs). Overall, nine dogs (3.4%) met study criteria of positivity based on either/both serology or PCR tests. Positive dogs were found in both regions of Mexico; five (2.7%) from Reynosa and four (3.6%) from Tuxtla Gutierrez. We found no association between infection status and state of origin, sex, age group, breed group, neighborhood, and whether other pets lived in the home. Conclusion: Our results re-emphasize dogs' utility as sentinels for T. cruzi in Mexico and underscore the need for improved veterinary diagnostic tests and parasite surveillance at the household level in endemic countries.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9391f15fa5412f93ff430c0260f769620f0a630,e9391f15fa5412f93ff430c0260f769620f0a630,"Edward Davila, Nadia A Fernandez-Santos, J.

"Infection by Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas, 1909) in a colony of Triatoma sherlocki Papa et al. 2002 (Reduviidae: Triatominae) present in a subsistence pig farm in Northeast Brazil.","Triatomines of the species Triatoma sherlocki are considered sylvatic; however, household invasion appears imminent, potentially carrying Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The aim of this study was to report the first occurrence of a colony of T. sherlocki infected by T. cruzi in a subsistence pig farm. Triatomines collected underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for T. cruzi detection and determination of blood meal source. The 19 triatomines collected in the pig farm were of the species T. sherlocki, comprising 26.3% nymphs (5/19), 52.6% males (10/19) and 21.1% females (4/19).

"The interplay between temperature, Trypanosoma cruzi parasite load, and nutrition: Their effects on the development and life-cycle of the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius prolixus","Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi transmitted by blood-sucking insects of the subfamily Triatominae, is a major neglected tropical disease affecting 6 to 7 million of people worldwide. Rhodnius prolixus, one of the most important vectors of Chagas disease in Latin America, is known to be highly sensitive to environmental factors, including temperature. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different temperatures on R. prolixus development and life-cycle, its relationship with T. cruzi, and to gather information about the nutritional habits and energy consumption of R. prolixus. We exposed uninfected and infected R. prolixus to four different temperatures ranging from 24°C to 30°C, and monitored their survival, developmental rate, body and blood meal masses, urine production, and the temporal dynamics of parasite concentration in the excreted urine of the triatomines over the course of their development. Our results demonstrate that temperature significantly impacts R. prolixus development, life-cycle and their relationship with T. cruzi, as R. prolixus exposed to higher temperatures had a shorter developmental time and a higher mortality rate compared to those exposed to lower temperatures, as well as a lower ability to retain weight between blood meals. Infection also decreased the capacity of the triatomines to retain weight gained by blood-feeding to the next developmental stage, and this effect was proportional to parasite concentration in excreted urine. We also showed that T. cruzi multiplication varied depending on temperature, with the lowest temperature having the lowest parasite load. Our findings provide important insights into the potential impact of climate change on the epidemiology of Chagas disease, and can contribute to efforts to model the future distribution of this disease. Our study also raises new questions, highlighting the need for further research in order to understand the complex interactions between temperature, vector biology, and parasite transmission.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/efbc0c6790e1bdc6f6387fc60cce77c173cf6aa2,efbc0c6790e1bdc6f6387fc60cce77c173cf6aa2,"Henri Loshouarn, A.

Comparative proteomic analysis of the hemolymph and salivary glands of Rhodnius prolixus and R. colombiensis reveals candidates associated with differential lytic activity against Trypanosoma cruzi Dm28c and T. cruzi Y,"Background Immune response of triatomines plays an important role in the success or failure of transmission of T. cruzi. Studies on parasite–vector interaction have shown the presence of trypanolytic factors and have been observed to be differentially expressed among triatomines, which affects the transmission of some T. cruzi strains or DTUs (Discrete Typing Units). Methodology/Principal findings Trypanolytic factors were detected in the hemolymph and saliva of R. prolixus against epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of the Y strain (T. cruzi II). To identify the components of the immune response that could be involved in this lytic activity, a comparative proteomic analysis was carried out, detecting 120 proteins in the hemolymph of R. prolixus and 107 in R. colombiensis. In salivary glands, 1103 proteins were detected in R. prolixus and 853 in R. colombiensis. A higher relative abundance of lysozyme, prolixin, nitrophorins, and serpin as immune response proteins was detected in the hemolymph of R. prolixus. Among the R. prolixus salivary proteins, a higher relative abundance of nitrophorins, lipocalins, and triabins was detected. The higher relative abundance of these immune factors in R. prolixus supports their participation in the lytic activity on Y strain (T. cruzi II), but not on Dm28c (T. cruzi I), which is resistant to lysis by hemolymph and salivary proteins of R. prolixus due to mechanisms of evading oxidative stress caused by immune factors. Conclusions/Significance The lysis resistance observed in the Dm28c strain would be occurring at the DTU I level. T. cruzi I is the DTU with the greatest geographic distribution, from the south of the United States to central Chile and Argentina, a distribution that could be related to resistance to oxidative stress from vectors. Likewise, we can say that lysis against strain Y could occur at the level of DTU II and could be a determinant of the vector inability of these species to transmit T. cruzi II. Future proteomic and transcriptomic studies on vectors and the interactions of the intestinal microbiota with parasites will help to confirm the determinants of successful or failed vector transmission of T. cruzi DTUs in different parts of the Western Hemisphere.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/462e35377bcccb65ebbb8740ed4236596024b147,462e35377bcccb65ebbb8740ed4236596024b147,"Hamilton J.

A scoping review of triatomine control for Chagas disease prevention: current and developing tools in Latin America and the United States.,"Chagas disease is an infectious disease of human and animal health concern, with 6-8 million chronic human infections and over 50,000 deaths throughout the Americas annually. Hematophagous insects of the subfamily Triatominae, also called kissing bugs, vector the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas (Trypanosomatida: Trypanosomatidae), that causes Chagas disease. Despite the large human health burden, Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease with inadequate funding for research and preventive practices. Given the resource-poor environment of most agencies trying to protect public health, it is critical to consider all control options for reducing vector populations and the risk of human exposure to T. cruzi to identify the most appropriate tools for each context. While numerous triatomine control methods exist, the literature lacks a compilation of the strategies used, a critical examination of their efficiency, and a particular focus on triatomine control in the United States compared to elsewhere in the Americas. Here, we present a review of the literature to assess historical intervention strategies of existing and developing triatomine control methods. For each method, we discuss progress in the field, future research to further advance the method, and limitations. While we found that pyrethroid insecticide is still the most commonly used method of triatomine and Chagas disease control, we suggest that complementing these techniques with alternative control methods in development will help to achieve Chagas disease reduction goals.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d60aeb4fa06a1ecf143960a7e3163f4a04ce0560,d60aeb4fa06a1ecf143960a7e3163f4a04ce0560,"Yuexun Tian, Cassandra Durden, G.

Trypanosomes and Gut Microbiota Interactions in Triatomine bugs and Tsetse Flies: A vectorial perspective.,"Triatomines (kissing bugs) and tsetse flies (genus: Glossina) are natural vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei, respectively. T. cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease, endemic in Latin America, while T. brucei causes African sleeping sickness disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Both triatomines and tsetse flies are host to a diverse community of gut microbiota that co-exist with the parasites in the gut. Evidence has shown that the gut microbiota of both vectors plays a key role in parasite development and transmission. However, knowledge on the mechanism involved in parasite-microbiota interaction remains limited and scanty. Here, we attempt to analyse Trypanosoma spp. and gut microbiota interactions in tsetse flies and triatomines, with a focus on understanding the possible mechanisms involved by reviewing published articles on the subject. We report that interactions between Trypanosoma spp. and gut microbiota can be both direct and indirect. In direct interactions, the gut microbiota directly affects the parasite via the formation of biofilms and the production of anti-parasitic molecules, while on the other hand, Trypanosoma spp. produces antimicrobial proteins to regulate gut microbiota of the vector. In indirect interactions, the parasite and gut bacteria affect each other through host vector-activated processes such as immunity and metabolism. Although we are beginning to understand how gut microbiota interacts with the Trypanosoma parasites, there is still a need for further studies on functional role of gut microbiota in parasite development to maximize the use of symbiotic bacteria in vector and parasite control.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f6aa916e434a6313fdcfe134b485831be70eb90c,f6aa916e434a6313fdcfe134b485831be70eb90c,"Zeph Nelson Omondi, Ayşe Caner, S.

"Life history data of a Triatoma protracta nahuatlae, T. sinaloensis, and their laboratory hybrids (Hemiptera: Reduviidae)","Chagas disease is one of the most significant vector-borne diseases in Mexico. The presence of “sylvatic” triatomine vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas) inside human dwellings necessitates estimating their vectorial capacity. To estimate this capacity in Triatoma protracta nahuatlae (Ryckman), Triatoma sinaloensis (Ryckman), and their laboratory hybrids, 6 biological parameters were examined. Triatoma sinaloensis exhibited the shortest development time (155 days), with a median of 12 blood meals. Mortality rates varied from 35% to 45% in the 3 studied cohorts. All 3 cohorts were aggressive, initiating feeding within 0.5–1 min, and had similar feeding periods ranging from 10 to 18 min. A majority (75.3–97.9%) of the hybrids defecated when feeding, immediately after feeding, or in less than 1 min post-feeding. In contrast, only 7–42% of nymphs of T. sinaloensis defecated during the same period. Our results regarding the 6 parameters studied confirm the potential role of T. p. nahuatlae as an efficient vector of T. cruzi. Triatoma sinaloensis, on the other hand, exhibited limited vectorial capacity primarily due to its poor defecation behavior. Continued surveillance of these “sylvatic” triatomine populations is necessary to prevent an epidemiological problem.

Influence of temperature variability on the feeding behavior and blood consumption of Triatoma infestans (Hemiptera: Reduviidae).,"The transmission and incidence of vector-borne diseases rely on vector distribution and life history traits such as survival, fecundity, and feeding. Since arthropod disease vectors are ectotherms, these vital rates are strongly influenced by temperature. Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite is transmitted when the feces of the infected triatomine enter the bloodstream of the host. One of the most important vector-species of this disease in the Southern Cone region of South America is Triatoma infestans. In this study, we evaluated the role of constant and variable environmental temperature on the feeding behavior of T. infestans. Fifth-instar nymphs were acclimatized to 4 thermal treatments comprising 2 temperatures (27 °C and 18 °C) with and without diurnal thermal variability (27 ± 5 °C and 18 ± 5 °C). Individuals were fed weekly for 7 wk to quantify their feeding. Our results showed lower feeding frequency in nymphs acclimatized to cold temperature compared to those from warmer temperature treatments. However, treatments with thermal variability presented a nonlinear effect on feeding, with an increased feeding rate in the cold, variable treatment and a decreased feeding rate in the warm, variable treatment. Individuals maintained under cold treatments, the variable temperature exhibited a higher feeding rate and the lowest amount of ingested blood among all treatments. Thus, natural diurnal temperature variation cannot be ignored if we are to make more accurate T. cruzi transmission risk predictions now and in the future.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d62d1064659af29ab9c39f9b92648b893714952c,d62d1064659af29ab9c39f9b92648b893714952c,"Bárbara Álvarez-Duhart, G.

Life history data of four populations of Triatoma mexicana (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) from Central Mexico.,"Triatomine bugs are vectors for the Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas parasites, the etiological agent for Chagas disease. This study evaluated 6 epidemiologically significant behaviors (development time, number of blood meals required for molting to the next instar, mortality rate, aggressiveness, feeding duration, and defecation delay) across 4 populations of Triatoma mexicana Herrich-Schaeffer (Heteroptera: Reduviidae), a major T. cruzi vector in Central Mexico. We collected triatomines from areas characterized by high (HP), medium (MP), medium-high (MHP), and low (LP) prevalence of human T. cruzi infection. The MHP population had the shortest development time, <290 days. Both the HP and MP populations required the most blood meals to molt to the next instar, with a median of 13. Mortality rates varied across all populations, ranging from 44% to 52%. All of the tested populations showed aggressive behavior during feeding. All populations shared similar feeding durations, with most exceeding 13 min and increasing with each instar. Quick defecation, during feeding, immediately after or less than 1 min after feeding, was observed in most nymphs (78%-90%) from the MP and MHP populations and adults (74%-92%) from HP, MP, and MHP populations. Though most parameters suggest a low potential for T. mexicana to transmit T. cruzi, unique feeding and defecation behaviors in 3 populations (excluding the LP group) could elevate their epidemiological importance. These population-specific differences may contribute to the varying prevalence rates of T. cruzi infection in areas where T. mexicana is found.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77207a5daa25ea5d819c25818bea9adefa1a5619,77207a5daa25ea5d819c25818bea9adefa1a5619,"B.

Oral Chagas Disease in Colombia—Confirmed and Suspected Routes of Transmission,"Chagas disease (CD) remains endemic throughout many regions of Colombia despite implementing decades of vector control strategies in several departments. Some regions have had a significant decrease in vectorial transmission, but the oral ingestion of Trypanosoma cruzi through consumption of contaminated food and drink products is increasingly described. This form of transmission has important public health relevance in Colombia due to an increase in reported acute CD cases and clinical manifestations that often lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Oral CD in Colombia has been associated with the consumption of contaminated fruit juices, such as palm wine, sugar cane, or tangerine juice and water for consumption, or contaminated surfaces where food has been prepared. Another interesting route of oral transmission includes ingestion of unbeknownst infected armadillos’ blood, which is related to a traditional medicine practice in Colombia. Some earlier reports have also implemented consumption of infected bush meat as a source, but this is still being debated. Within the Amazon Basin, oral transmission is now considered the principal cause of acute CD in these regions. Furthermore, new cases of acute CD are now being seen in departments where CD has not been documented, and triatomine vectors are not naturally found, thus raising suspicion for oral transmission. The oral CD could also be considered a food-borne zoonosis, and odoriferous didelphid secretions have been implemented in contaminating the human dwelling environment, increasing the risk of consumption of infectious metacyclic trypomastigotes. In this article, we will discuss the complex transmission dynamics of oral CD in Colombia and further examine the unique clinical manifestations of this route of infection. New insights into the oral transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi are being discovered in Colombia, which can help bring increased awareness and a better understanding of this neglected tropical disease to reduce the burden of CD throughout Latin America.",2024,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc0186c7ad4a5b90a5c67c2fcf68f12ebe8f0e08,bc0186c7ad4a5b90a5c67c2fcf68f12ebe8f0e08,"Norman L.

Sugar feeding in triatomines: a new perspective for controlling the transmission of Chagas disease,"Introduction: Triatomines are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Currently, there is no vaccine against this disease. Thus, control of the insect vector population is the main strategy available to reduce the number of cases. Triatomines are considered obligate hematophagous, but different alternative feeding behaviors were described, such as haemolymphagy or plant feeding. Methods: To determine the preference for sugar feeding in nymphs and adults of Rhodnius prolixus, the insects were exposed a piece of cotton containing bromophenol blue plus sucrose. In addition, we offered several sugars for different species of triatomines, and tested sugar meals as a route of delivery of insecticides in first-instar nymphs of R. prolixus. The effect of sugar feeding on the physiology of these different species of triatomines was recorded. Results: First instar nymphs ingested sucrose more strongly than other stages, and showed high mortality rates. In different species of triatomines, sucrose induced an ingestion, but engorgement varied according to the species. R. prolixus nymphs showed an indiscriminate intake of various sugars, with very different physiological effects. Furthermore, ingesting different combinations of insecticides + sugar significantly reduced insect survival. Discussion: In summary, we described for the first-time sugar feeding as a widespread behavior in several species of triatomines, and the possibility of the use of toxic sugar baits for the control of these vectors. The knowledge of feeding behavior in these insects can be fundamental for the development of new strategies to control Chagas disease.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69d910bc27e9debf8b03fe47bacfb9bfcddd7fb2,69d910bc27e9debf8b03fe47bacfb9bfcddd7fb2,"Mariana C.

"Development of an operational trap for collection, killing, and preservation of triatomines (Hemiptera: Reduviidae): the kissing bug kill trap.","Surveillance of triatomines or kissing bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae), the insect vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, a Chagas disease agent, is hindered by the lack of an effective trap. To develop a kissing bug trap, we made iterative improvements over 3 years on a basic design resulting in 7 trap prototypes deployed across field sites in Texas, United States and Northern Mexico, yielding the capture of 325 triatomines of 4 species (Triatoma gerstaeckeri [Stål], T. sanguisuga [LeConte], T. neotomae [Neiva], and T. rubida [Uhler]). We began in 2019 with vertical transparent tarpaulin panel traps illuminated with artificial light powered by AC current, which were successful in autonomous trapping of flying triatomines, but were expensive, labor-intensive, and fragile. In 2020, we switched to white LED lights powered by a solar cell. We tested a scaled-down version of the vertical panel traps, a commercial cross-vane trap, and a multiple-funnel trap. The multiple-funnel traps captured 2.6× more kissing bugs per trap-day than cross-vane traps and approached the performance of the vertical panel traps in number of triatomines captured, number of triatomines per trap-day and triatomines per arthropod bycatch. Multiple-funnel traps required the least labor, were more durable, and had the highest triatomines per day per cost. Propylene glycol in the collection cups effectively preserved captured triatomines allowing for molecular detection of T. cruzi. The trapping experiments established dispersal patterns for the captured species.

"Zoonotic Cycle of American Trypanosomiasis in an Endemic Region of the Argentine Chaco, Factors That Influenced a Paradigm Shift","Simple Summary Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) poses a serious health problem in the American region, with approximately one-quarter of the Latin American population at risk of infection due to the geographical distribution of the insect vectors (Triatominae spp.). The transmission scenarios for this disease involve multiple interdependent factors. The parasite has developed, over evolutionary time, multiple strategies that have enabled its successful survival. The variables governing the transmission cycle are diverse and unique to each ecological scenario. Human intervention, such as deforestation, large-scale changes in land use, and loss of biodiversity, in the Chaco region over many years, along with sustained control interventions, may have significantly impacted the structure of wild transmission cycles and their relationships with the environment. This could potentially reduce the prevalence of the parasite in the domestic cycle. This study aims to describe the transmission dynamics of the sylvatic cycle of T. cruzi, identify factors determining potential zoonotic spillover, and explore how they could contribute to the elimination of Chagas disease as a public health problem in this area of Argentina. Abstract Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis), is a highly complex zoonosis that is present throughout South America, Central America, and Mexico. The transmission of this disease is influenced by various factors, including human activities like deforestation and land use changes, which may have altered the natural transmission cycles and their connection to the environment. In this study conducted in the Argentine Chaco region, we examined the transmission dynamics of T. cruzi by collecting blood samples from wild and domestic animals, as well as triatomine bugs from human dwellings, across five sites of varying anthropic intervention. Samples were analyzed for T. cruzi infection via qPCR, and we additionally examined triatomines for bloodmeal analysis via NGS amplicon sequencing. Our analysis revealed a 15.3% infection rate among 20 wild species (n = 123) and no T. cruzi presence in 9 species of domestic animals (n = 1359) or collected triatomines via qPCR. Additionally, we found chicken (34.28%), human (21.59%), and goat (19.36%) as the predominant bloodmeal sources across all sites. These findings suggest that anthropic intervention and other variables analyzed may have directly impacted the spillover dynamics of T. cruzi’s sylvatic cycle and potentially reduced its prevalence in human habitats.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96959ff7353d9fdad3d89da017a17034ea6b2b30,96959ff7353d9fdad3d89da017a17034ea6b2b30,"Andrea Gómez-Bravo, Sebastián Cirignoli, D.
