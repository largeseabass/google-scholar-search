The distribution of triatomine (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in Illinois and Missouri: historical records and specimen submissions from community science programs.,"Triatomine species (kissing bugs) infected with Trypanosoma cruzi are found across the southern United States. The northern limits of Trypanosoma cruzi infected kissing bugs are less understood. The objective of this work was to describe the locations of kissing bugs from Illinois and Missouri based on historical records, submissions to Texas A&M University's (TAMU) Kissing Bug Community Science Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and records from online platforms (iNaturalist, BugGuide, and GBIF) up to and including 2022. A total of 228 records were discovered, including 186 from historical or observation platforms and 42 specimens submitted to TAMU or CDC. Species included Triatoma sanguisuga (221 total records, 9 nymphs) and Triatoma lecticularia (7 records). Notably, nearly all (24/26) records submitted to TAMU were collected indoors. Twelve of the 30 (40%) specimens tested were positive for the presence of T. cruzi, including parasite discrete taxonomic units TcI and TcIV. One triatomine sample had been found in a bed feeding on the submitter; this bug was positive for T. cruzi and had evidence of human blood in its gut. Records suggest a ubiquitous distribution in Missouri and potentially to the northernmost border in Illinois. Further investigations into triatomine distribution and infection status are needed within states assumed to be northern limits in order to create public health and veterinary health messaging and baseline distributional maps from which to measure future range shifts in relation to a changing climate.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26c765439f3ffb2a1f84d0a00d82100d54b09b8f,26c765439f3ffb2a1f84d0a00d82100d54b09b8f,"Ellen M.

Characterization of Latin American migrants at risk for Trypanosoma cruzi infection in a non-endemic setting. Insights into initial evaluation of cardiac and digestive involvement,"Background Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease (CD), a potentially fatal disease characterized by cardiac disorders and digestive, neurological or mixed alterations. T. cruzi is transmitted to humans by the bite of triatomine vectors; both the parasite and disease are endemic in Latin America and the United States. In the last decades, population migration has changed the classic epidemiology of T. cruzi, contributing to its global spread to traditionally non-endemic countries. Screening is recommended for Latin American populations residing in non-endemic countries. Methods The present study analyzes the epidemiological characteristics of 2,820 Latin American individuals who attended the International Health Service (IHS) of the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona between 2002 and 2019. The initial assessment of organ damage among positive cases of T. cruzi infection was analyzed, including the results of electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, barium enema and esophagogram. Results Among all the screened individuals attending the clinic, 2,441 (86.6%) were born in Bolivia and 1,993 (70.7%) were female. Of individuals, 1,517 (81.5%) reported previous exposure to the vector, which is a strong risk factor associated with T. cruzi infection; 1,382 individuals were positive for T. cruzi infection. The first evaluation of individuals with confirmed T. cruzi infection, showed 148 (17.1%) individuals with Chagasic cardiomyopathy, the main diagnostic method being an ECG and the right bundle branch block (RBBB) for the most frequent disorder; 16 (10.8%) individuals had a normal ECG and were diagnosed of Chagasic cardiomyopathy by echocardiogram. Conclusions We still observe many Latin American individuals who were at risk of T. cruzi infection in highly endemic areas in their countries of origin, and who have not been previously tested for T. cruzi infection. In fact, even in Spain, a country with one of the highest proportion of diagnosis of Latin American populations, T. cruzi infection remains underdiagnosed. The screening of Latin American populations presenting with a similar profile as reported here should be promoted. ECG is considered necessary to assess Chagasic cardiomyopathy in positive individuals, but echocardiograms should also be considered as a diagnostic approach given that it can detect cardiac abnormalities when the ECG is normal.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63bada597d0219b567079b6ca196e1962c0873f1,63bada597d0219b567079b6ca196e1962c0873f1,"Pedro Laynez-Roldán, Irene Losada-Galván, Elizabeth J Posada, Leonardo de la Torre Ávila, A.

"Collection of triatomines from sylvatic habitats by a Trypanosoma cruzi-infected scent detection dog in Texas, USA","Background Triatomine insects, vectors of the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), are challenging to locate in sylvatic habitats. Collection techniques used in the United States often rely on methods to intercept seasonally dispersing adults or on community scientists’ encounters. Neither method is suited for detecting nest habitats likely to harbor triatomines, which is important for vector surveillance and control. Furthermore, manual inspection of suspected harborages is difficult and unlikely to reveal novel locations and host associations. Similar to a team that used a trained dog to detect sylvatic triatomines in Paraguay, we worked with a trained scent detection dog to detect triatomines in sylvatic locations across Texas. Principle methodology/Findings Ziza, a 3-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer previously naturally infected with T. cruzi, was trained to detect triatomines. Over the course of 6 weeks in the fall of 2017, the dog and her handler searched at 17 sites across Texas. The dog detected 60 triatomines at 6 sites; an additional 50 triatomines were contemporaneously collected at 1 of these sites and 2 additional sites without the assistance of the dog. Approximately 0.98 triatomines per hour were found when only humans were conducting searches; when working with the dog, approximately 1.71 triatomines per hour were found. In total, 3 adults and 107 nymphs of four species (Triatoma gerstaeckeri, Triatoma protracta, Triatoma sanguisuga, and Triatoma indictiva) were collected. PCR testing of a subset revealed T. cruzi infection, including DTUs TcI and TcIV, in 27% of nymphs (n = 103) and 66% of adults (n = 3). Bloodmeal analysis of a subset of triatomines (n = 5) revealed feeding on Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus), and eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus). Conclusion/Significance A trained scent detection dog enhanced triatomine detections in sylvatic habitats. This approach is effective at detecting nidicolous triatomines. Control of sylvatic sources of triatomines is challenging, but this new knowledge of specific sylvatic habitats and key hosts may reveal opportunities for novel vector control methods to block the transmission of T. cruzi to humans and domestic animals.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63efdda6fef9eece724a101a045d62d868d0977d,63efdda6fef9eece724a101a045d62d868d0977d,"Devin M.

Validation of a multiplex microsphere immunoassay for detection of antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi in dogs,"The vector-borne protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease in humans, dogs, and many other mammalian hosts. Canine Chagas disease is increasingly diagnosed in dogs of the southern United States where triatomine insect vectors occur, and there are limited veterinary testing options; only the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test is offered at a single accredited diagnostic laboratory. We evaluated a multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MIA) for the detection of antibodies against T. cruzi in dogs and compared it with existing serologic methods to establish cutoff values and relative sensitivity and specificity. We tested 135 canine sera that had been characterized using the IFA and off-label use of 2 commercial rapid assays with our multiplex MIA against 12 antigens: 9 T. cruzi antigens, a negative control recombinant protein (green fluorescent protein, GFP), a Leishmania antigen, and a canine parvovirus antigen (used as an antibody control given near-ubiquitous parvoviral vaccination). The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) ratio between each T. cruzi antigen and GFP was calculated for every sample. Samples with an antigen:GFP MFI ratio > 4 SDs above the mean of 25 known-negative sera were considered positive to that antigen. Samples testing positive to ≥ 2 antigens were considered positive for T. cruzi antibodies. Compared to the IFA, our multiplex MIA had a relative sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97.0%. Given its precision, high-throughput format, potential for automation, and lack of subjective interpretation, our multiplex MIA should be considered a valid and improved assay for T. cruzi antibodies in dogs.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d5f9d532cd842f1826206dfc522ecee3a064ae8,7d5f9d532cd842f1826206dfc522ecee3a064ae8,"Carlos A.

"Prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi, the Etiologic Agent of Chagas Disease, Infection in Texas Skunks (Mammalia: Mephitidae).","Background: Chagas disease is one of the world's most neglected tropical diseases, infecting over six million people across the Americas. The hemoparasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent for the disease, circulating in domestic, peridomestic, and sylvatic transmission cycles that are maintained by triatomine vectors and a diversity of wild and synanthropic hosts. Public health and wildlife management interventions targeting the interruption of T. cruzi transmission rely on an understanding of the dynamics driving the ecology of this zoonotic pathogen. One wildlife host that purportedly plays a role in the transmission of Chagas disease within the southern United States is the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), although infection prevalence in this species is poorly understood. Materials and Methods: To this end, we conducted a PCR-based surveillance of T. cruzi in 235 wild skunks, representing 4 species, across 76 counties and 10 ecoregions in Texas, United States, along with an evaluation of risk factors associated with the infection. Results: We recovered an overall T. cruzi prevalence of 17.9% for all mephitid taxa aggregated, ranging between 6.7% for plains spotted skunks (Spilogale putorius interrupta) and 42.9% for western spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis). We report the first cases of T. cruzi infection in plains spotted and American hog-nosed skunks (Conepatus leuconotus), of important note for conservation medicine since populations of both species are declining within Texas. Although not statistically significant, we also detected trends for juveniles to exhibit greater infection risk than adults and for differential sex biases in T. cruzi prevalence between taxa, which align with variations in species-specific seasonal activity patterns. No geographic or taxonomic risk factors were identified. Conclusion: Our study contributed key data for population viability analyses and epidemiologic models in addition to providing a baseline for future T. cruzi surveillance among skunks and other wildlife species.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c253b02df938be5b4cac1060dcbf363573b69e1a,c253b02df938be5b4cac1060dcbf363573b69e1a,"Bonnie E Gulas-Wroblewski, Rodion Gorchakov, Rebecca B Kairis, R.

Chagas Disease,"Chagas disease, which is caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a leading neglected tropical disease in the United States. An estimated 240 000 to 350 000 persons in the United States are infected, primarily immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and South America, where the disease is endemic. The parasite is transmitted by the triatomine bug but can also be passed through blood transfusion, via organ transplant, or congenitally. Approximately 30% of infected persons later develop cardiac and/or gastrointestinal complications. Health care providers should consider screening at-risk patients with serologic testing. Early diagnosis and treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox can help prevent complications.",2023,12,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f06a9ee8668674184acd43a6f3b4dc1780387bbd,f06a9ee8668674184acd43a6f3b4dc1780387bbd,"N.

Comparative proteomic analysis of the hemolymph and salivary glands of Rhodnius prolixus and R. colombiensis reveals candidates associated with differential lytic activity against Trypanosoma cruzi I and T. cruzi II,"Background Immune response of triatomines plays an important role in the success or failure of transmission of T. cruzi. Studies on parasite–vector interaction have shown the presence of trypanolytic factors and have been observed to be differentially expressed among triatomines, which affects the transmission of some T. cruzi strains or DTUs (Discrete Typing Units). Methodology/Principal Findings Trypanolytic factors were detected in the hemolymph and saliva of R. prolixus against epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of T. cruzi II. To identify the components of the immune response that could be involved in this lytic activity, a comparative proteomic analysis was carried out, detecting 120 proteins in the hemolymph of R. prolixus and 107 in R. colombiensis. In salivary glands, 1103 proteins were detected in R. prolixus and 853 in R. colombiensis. A higher relative abundance of lysozyme, prolixin, nitrophorins, and serpin as immune response proteins was detected in the hemolymph of R. prolixus. Among the R. prolixus salivary proteins, a higher relative abundance of nitrophorins, lipocalins, and triabins was detected. The higher relative abundance of these immune factors in R. prolixus supports their participation in the lytic activity on T. cruzi II, but not on T. cruzi I, which is resistant to lysis by hemolymph and salivary proteins of R. prolixus due to mechanisms of evading oxidative stress caused by immune factors. Conclusions/Significance T. cruzi I is a DTU distributed from the southern United States to the center of Chile and Argentina, and its successful spread across this range could be related to resistance to oxidative stress in vectors. Future proteomic and transcriptomic studies on vectors and the interactions of the intestinal microbiota with parasites will help to confirm the determinants of successful or failed vector transmission of T. cruzi DTUs in different parts of the Western Hemisphere. Author summary Some factors can facilitate or prevent T. cruzi transmission, i.e. vector immunity. Our work has managed to detect a stronger immune response against T. cruzi II in R. prolixus saliva and haemolymph, compared to that of R. colombiensis. Proteins from both species’ saliva and haemolymph were analysed for studying factors which might have been involved in such response; most proteins were detected in both species’ haemolymph, thereby indicating common immune mechanisms. Three proteins having oxidative immune activity were only expressed in R. prolixus. Lipocalin diversity and abundance predominated in R. prolixus saliva; these proteins are involved in nitric oxide metabolism and their role in immunity could be key in host defence against T. cruzi. Recognising the components modulating parasite transmission in a vector helps in understanding how such factors act independently and how they would act synergistically against T. cruzi, thereby enabling us to establish tools regarding Chaga’s disease epidemiology, aimed at predicting T. cruzi distribution and creating transmission control mechanisms.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f1c910ba8d1dbb8b8269b5411c79eb586b064b7c,f1c910ba8d1dbb8b8269b5411c79eb586b064b7c,"Hamilton J.

Parasites: The Inside Story,"P The Inside Story shows how parasites coexisted and spread around the world through host migration, particularly through humans, and researches their origin and evolution. The book describes how the choice of host has affected the successful survival of some parasites and avoidance of extinction. The authors show how parasites influence and manipulate their intermediate host, which makes them more visible and easier prey for the next host, causing the host to “look foolish.” The authors use novel and entertaining approaches to explore their subject, such as describing how the Israelite Jonah spent 3 days in the belly of a whale and what parasites he might have encountered during that 3-day stay. Another entertaining approach was participation in the parasite Olympics, where parasites earned medals according to their success and survival by choosing and adjusting to their hosts. Ascaris lumbricoides is a gold medal winner as one of the most durable internal parasites of humans. However, the book overlooked Strongyloides stercoralis, which can cause hyperinfection syndrome in immunocompromised hosts and is considered an emerging infectious disease and deserves an honorary Olympic medal. Babesiosis is another notable emerging parasitic disease that was overlooked. I appreciated the novel and appealing way in which the authors show how parasites affect other species and human lives, while also incorporating their nonharmful roles, as in the case of mutualism and commensalism. I loved the immense and vivid imagery used to describe the breathtaking basin of the Congo River but was saddened that many persons living along the river might not continue to see that beautiful scenery because of river blindness caused by Onchocerca volvulus. The stories, connections to real persons, and references to at least 3 movies and 1 television series indicate the detailed efforts involved in writing this book. The book has a high level of scientific detail as it dives into history, ecology, evolution, and future outlooks. The authors discuss how climate change is affecting parasite existence. An example is the migration of triatomine kissing bugs to the southern half of the United States, which might increase the risk for Trypanosoma cruzi transmission, causing Chagas disease (to which the book attributes Charles Darwin’s death, from an infection he acquired during a trip to South America). The authors also elaborate on international scientific collaboration during epidemiologic investigations, such as the collaboration between researchers from the United States and Mongolia during a hantavirus infection outbreak in New Mexico. Readers will learn about parasite eradication campaigns, some of which did not turn out well, as was the case for the Schistosoma mansoni eradication campaign in Egypt that resulted in populationwide infections with hepatitis C virus. The book has 29 color photos, making the stories only more vibrant, and helps in understanding parasite life cycles and in making diagnoses. This book will appeal to readers interested in emerging infectious diseases, nonparasitologists, scientists, and clinicians and is an admirable expedition into the amazing world of parasites.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4654f475630f38b150a637624817a85787cadf79,4654f475630f38b150a637624817a85787cadf79,Rezhan H.

"Identification of a triatomine infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in an urban area of the state of Veracruz, Mexico: A comprehensive study","Chagas disease, considered a neglected disease, was initially confined to rural localities in endemic areas; however, in recent years through the process of urbanization and migration of infected people, the disease is gaining importance in urban environments. The presence of the vector in urban areas in most cases is due to the passive transport of vectors, but recently, its presence seems to be linked to vector adaptation processes associated with climate change. This paper reports the occurrence of an infected triatomine in the peridomicile of a house in an urban area of Córdoba, Veracruz, Mexico, where the species found is described, the molecular characteristics and resistance to BZN and NFX of the Trypanosoma cruzi isolate obtained, as well as serological data of the dwelling inhabitants.

The role of sylvatic triatomine species as vectors of T. cruzi in Mexico remains to be fully understood. Our research on the epidemiology of Chagas disease in Southeastern Mexico involved sampling triatomines in rural settings. Materials and Methods: A triatomine was collected in a peridomestic environment of a rural dwelling in the state of Chiapas. The triatomine was identified morphologically as an adult female Eratyrus cuspidatus Stal. Results: Microscopic analysis revealed flagellate forms of T. cruzi in the feces of the E. cuspidatus collected. This was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Infection with Trypanosoma Cruzi Chagas and Characterization of Human Habitats of Triatoma Picturata (Usinger) in Western Mexico,"ABSTRACT: Chagas disease is one of the most important vector-borne diseases in Latin America. Triatoma picturata (Usinger), distributed in western Mexico, is one of the most important vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas. Knowing the type and materials used for building homes could lead to improved methods for controlling triatomines by focusing efforts on controlling every species of triatomine in its specific microhabitat. Houses in three studied localities of western Mexico that harbored T. picturata were characterized, as well as two entomological indices. Infestation Index values varied from 10.8% to 51.9% in the three localities, whereas Natural Infection Index values varied from 18.1% to 35.2%. Characteristics of houses invaded by T. picturata also varied. In Juan Gil Preciado, with the highest Entomological Index values, most houses were built of adobe walls with a roof of clay tiles and a dirt floor, and included the presence of domestic animals. Our data indicate that the potential risk of infection with T. cruzi differs markedly for inhabitants of the three studied localities, which demonstrates the importance of studying local populations of triatomines. Our study should contribute to decision-making regarding triatomine control efforts by providing profiles of houses that are more susceptible to triatomine invasion.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b192815a59d10c225cece8523d79d11044d83e1b,b192815a59d10c225cece8523d79d11044d83e1b,"T.

"Chagas Disease, a Triatomine Bug-Transmitted Protozoan Infection","Chagas disease is a potentially fatal, chronic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan parasite. It causes 6 to 8 million cases and 50,000 deaths each year. Humans and animals usually become infected with T. cruzi via triatomine bugs, also called kissing or conenose bugs, found only in the Americas. Disease transmitted by triatomine bugs generally occurs in rural areas of Mexico, Central America, and South America, but it is becoming more prevalent in non-endemic areas like the US as asymptomatic infected people move from rural to urban areas of Latin America and other regions.  In the US, approximately 300,000 people are currently infected with Chagas disease, 18,000 in Florida. Most if not all of them were infected elsewhere; local transmission of Chagas disease via triatomines in the US is rare. Awareness and understanding of Chagas disease are critical to detect and treat cases early.

Crossing experiments detect partial reproductive isolation among populations of Triatoma longipennis (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae).,"Chagas disease is an important vector-borne disease endemic in Mexico. Of the 33 triatomine species found in Mexico, Triatoma longipennis (Usinger) is considered among the most important because of its infection indices, capacity for transmitting Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas), and its distribution areas. Here, we describe the results of a reproductive isolation analysis among 5 populations of T. longipennis collected from representative areas of Mexico. Fertility and segregation of morphological characteristics were examined in two generations of hybrids. The percentage of pairs with (fertile) offspring varied from 30% to 100% in the parental crosses, while these values varied from 0 to 100% in the intersite crosses.

"Chagas Disease, A Review of the Literature","Chagas disease is a vector-borne (triatomine) infection caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Synonyms for this disease are: American trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease and T. cruzi infection. 10, 5 The most common form of transmission of Chagas disease is through hematophagous triatomine insects (triatominae), which develop in dwellings in precarious conditions, The disease can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, organ transplantation, oral and congenital routes, and even more rarely by exceptional routes such as sexual contact and non-Triatominae vectors. American Trypanosomiasis is endemic in much of Mexico, Central and South America 1,11. it is estimated that ~6 million individuals are infected throughout Latin America, while ~300,000 are infected in the U.S.1, 10, 11,16 Chagas disease has two clearly differentiated phases. Initially, the acute phase lasts about two months after infection, they may have a skin lesion or a purplish swelling of an eyelid, they may have fever, headache, enlarged lymph nodes, pallor, muscle aches, shortness of breath, swelling, and abdominal or chest pain. During the chronic phase, the infection can cause sudden death due to cardiac arrhythmias or progressive heart failure due to destruction of the cardiac muscle and its innervations. 15 Appropriate diagnostics for acute infection, nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) from blood is recommended; For chronic infection, serological testing is employed. Antitrypanosomal agents, benznidazole and nifurtimox, have shown efficacy in treating T. cruzi infection, The most serious complication is chronic chagasic heart disease, since it is the main cause of death in sick patients. 16",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/02a92ce74e01835ca926db4cf45a006f0e26ac5f,02a92ce74e01835ca926db4cf45a006f0e26ac5f,"Karen Denis Gómez Arciniega, Ramsés Erwin López Castellón"

Dual localization of receptor-type adenylate cyclases and cAMP response protein 3 unveils the presence of two putative signaling microdomains in Trypanosoma cruzi,"ABSTRACT Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, a leading cause of disability and premature death in the Americas. This parasite spends its life between a triatomine insect and a mammalian host, transitioning between developmental stages in response to microenvironmental changes. Among the second messengers driving differentiation in T. cruzi, cAMP has been shown to mediate metacyclogenesis and response to osmotic stress, but this signaling pathway remains largely unexplored in this parasite. Adenylate cyclases (ACs) catalyze the conversion of ATP to cAMP. They comprise a multigene family encoding putative receptor-type ACs in T. cruzi. Using protein sequence alignment, we classified them into five groups and chose a representative member from each group to study their localization (TcAC1–TcAC5). We expressed an HA-tagged version of each protein in T. cruzi and performed immunofluorescence analysis. A peculiar dual localization of TcAC1 and TcAC2 was observed in the flagellar distal domain and in the contractile vacuole complex (CVC), and their enzymatic activity was confirmed by gene complementation in yeast. Furthermore, TcAC1 overexpressing parasites showed an increased metacyclogenesis, a defect in host cell invasion, and a reduced intracellular replication, highlighting the importance of this protein throughout T. cruzi life cycle. These mutants were more tolerant to hypoosmotic stress and showed a higher adhesion capacity during in vitro metacyclogenesis, whereas the wild-type phenotype was restored after disrupting TcAC1 localization. Finally, TcAC1 was found to interact with cAMP response protein 3 (TcCARP3), co-localizing with this protein in the flagellar tip and CVC. IMPORTANCE We identified three components of the cAMP signaling pathway (TcAC1, TcAC2, and TcCARP3) with dual localization in Trypanosoma cruzi: the flagellar distal domain and the CVC, structures involved in cell adhesion and osmoregulation, respectively. We found evidence on the role of TcAC1 in both cellular processes, as well as in metacyclogenesis. Our data suggest that TcACs act as signal sensors and transducers through cAMP synthesis in membrane microdomains. We propose a model in which TcACs sense the harsh conditions in the triatomine hindgut (nutrient deprivation, acidic pH, osmotic stress, ionic composition, hydrophobic interactions) and become active. Synthesis of cAMP then triggers cell adhesion prior completion of metacyclogenesis, while mediating a response to osmotic stress in the parasite. These results shed light into the mechanisms driving cAMP-mediated cell differentiation in T. cruzi, while raising new questions on the activation of TcACs and the role of downstream components of this pathway.

Trypanosoma cruzi infection in a dog in a non-endemic area: implications for one health,"The protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease also known as American trypanosomiasis, a vector-borne zoonosis widely dispersed across 21 countries in the Americas that can be transmitted to humans, wild and domestic animals mostly through the infected faeces of the blood-sucking triatomine insects. The role of dogs as sentinels or domestic reservoir for T. cruzi has been reported around the world.

"Trypanosoma cruzi in Mexican Neotropical vectors and mammals: wildlife, livestock, pets, and human population.","OBJECTIVE
To provide primary evidence of Trypanosoma cruzi landscape genetics in the Mexican Neotropics.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trypanosoma cruzi and discrete typing units (DTU) prevalence were analyzed in landscape communities of vectors, wildlife, livestock, pets, and sympatric human populations using endpoint PCR and sequencing of all relevant amplicons from mitochondrial (kDNA) and nuclear (ME, 18S, 24Sα) gene markers.


RESULTS
Although 98% of the infected sample-set (N=2 963) contained single or mixed infections of DTUI (TcI, 96.2%) and TcVI (22.6%), TcIV and TcII were also identified. Sensitivity of individual markers varied and was dependent on host taxon; kDNA, ME and 18S combined identified 95% of infections. ME genotyped 90% of vector infections, but 60% of mammals (36% wildlife), while neither 18S nor 24Sα typed more than 20% of mammal infections.


CONCLUSION
Available gene fragments to identify or genotype T. cruzi are not universally sensitive for all landscape parasite populations, highlighting important T. cruzi heteroge- neity among mammal reservoir taxa and triatomine species.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8d7715052afdc74ec4d2fef2f33d7236fb1ea465,8d7715052afdc74ec4d2fef2f33d7236fb1ea465,"Amaia Izeta-Alberdi, A.

Murine colon organoids as a novel model to study Trypanosoma cruzi infection and interactions with the intestinal epithelium,"Chagas disease (CD) is a life-threatening illness caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). With around seven million people infected worldwide and over 50,000 deaths per year, CD is a major public health issue in Latin America. The main route of transmission to humans is through a triatomine bug (vector-borne), but congenital and oral transmission have also been reported. The acute phase of CD presents mild symptoms but may develop into a long-lasting chronic illness, characterized by severely impaired cardiac, digestive, and neurological functions. The intestinal tissue appears to have a key role during oral transmission and chronic infection of CD. In this immune-privileged reservoir, dormant/quiescent parasites have been suggested to contribute to disease persistence, infection relapse, and treatment failure. However, the interaction between the intestinal epithelium and T. cruzi has not been examined in depth, in part, due to the lack of in vitro models that approximate to the biological and structural complexity of this tissue. Therefore, to understand the role played by the intestinal tissue during transmission and chronic infection, physiological models resembling the organ complexity are needed. Here we addressed this issue by establishing and characterizing adult stem cell-derived colonoid infection models that are clinically relevant for CD. 3D and 2D systems of murine intestinal organoids infected with T. cruzi Dm28c (a highly virulent strain associated with oral outbreaks) were analyzed at different time points by confocal microscopy. T. cruzi was able to invade and replicate in intestinal epithelial primary cells grown as intact organoids (3D) and monolayers (2D). The permissiveness to pathogen infection differed markedly between organoids and cell lines (primate and intestinal human cell lines). So far, this represents the first evidence of the potential that these cellular systems offer for the study of host-pathogen interactions and the discovery of effective anti-chagasic drugs.",2023,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/514141697868d266be1ba868163ec78e3fe50e43,514141697868d266be1ba868163ec78e3fe50e43,"H.

"Trypanosoma cruzi Survey in Poached Pichis (Zaedyus pichiy; Mammalia, Cingulata) from Mendoza, Argentina","Abstract: The transmission cycles of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, include a wide variety of mammals and hematophagous triatomine insects. Infection with this blood parasite has been confirmed in many armadillo species; however, information on infection in Zaedyus pichiy, a small armadillo that inhabits areas endemic to Chagas disease, is scarce. Our objective was to determine the infection frequency and parasite load of T. cruzi in 49 wild Z. pichiy confiscated dead from poachers in Mendoza, Argentina, 2010–2017. We detected T. cruzi DNA in 32 of 49 armadillos (65%) using real-time PCR, confirming infection with T. cruzi in a high proportion of confiscated pichis. No differences were found related to sex, age, or ecoregion origin of the assessed pichis. Parasite loads ranged between <0.1 and 8.88 parasite equivalents/microgram cardiac tissue. Additional studies on the infection status of Z. pichiy are needed to determine their role in the maintenance of the sylvatic transmission cycle and the potential zoonotic risk from hunted pichis.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/752a0ee0c5da752710f5c49dfd8ed4a38f24021b,752a0ee0c5da752710f5c49dfd8ed4a38f24021b,"Melisa E.

Temperature influences the excretion time and parasitic load of Trypanosoma cruzi in the Triatoma infestans vector,"Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite transmitted by triatomine insect vectors, which expel their infectious dejections when they feed, causing Chagas disease in humans. The transmission and incidence of this vector-borne disease depend on the vital traits of its vectors, including Triatoma infestans, the main vector in Southern South America. Being an ectothermic species, its metabolism and its vital traits respond to temperature fluctuations. Here, we evaluated if changes in the average and variability of temperature expected with climate change modify: (i) the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of T. cruzi within the vector T. infestans, (ii) its parasitic load, and (iii) the probability that its dejections were T. cruzi-positive. We acclimated triatomines infected with Dm28c T. cruzi strain to two constant and two variable temperature treatments and measured T. cruzi in their dejections by qPCR over a 42-day period. We observed that individuals in warm-temperature treatments showed lower EIP and higher parasitic load than cold-temperature treatments. Also, temperature variability can increase the parasitic load peak in cold-temperature treatments. Consequently, in a climate change scenario, there might be an increase in the vector capacity of T. infestans and probably a change in the risk of vectorial transmission of T. cruzi.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/84ecbaeee0af20fb588284ca01ab97c2b62a40dd,84ecbaeee0af20fb588284ca01ab97c2b62a40dd,"Clavijo-Baquet, Valenzuela-Perez, J.

Antimicrobial activity of NK cells to Trypanosoma cruzi infected human primary Keratinocytes,"Infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is causative for Chagas disease, which is a highly neglected tropical disease prevalent in Latin America. Humans are primary infected through vectorial transmission by blood-sucking triatomine bugs. The parasite enters the human host through mucous membranes or small skin lesions. Since keratinocytes are the predominant cell type in the epidermis, they play a critical role in detecting disruptions in homeostasis and aiding in pathogen elimination by the immune system in the human skin as alternative antigen-presenting cells. Interestingly, keratinocytes also act as a reservoir for T. cruzi, as the skin has been identified as a major site of persistent infection in mice with chronic Chagas disease. Moreover, there are reports of the emergence of T. cruzi amastigote nests in the skin of immunocompromised individuals who are experiencing reactivation of Chagas disease. This observation implies that the skin may serve as a site for persistent parasite presence during chronic human infection too and underscores the significance of investigating the interactions between T. cruzi and skin cells. Consequently, the primary objective of this study was to establish and characterize the infection kinetics in human primary epidermal keratinocytes (hPEK). Our investigation focused on surface molecules that either facilitated or hindered the activation of natural killer (NK) cells, which play a crucial role in controlling the infection. To simulate the in vivo situation in humans, an autologous co-culture model was developed to examine the interactions between T. cruzi infected keratinocytes and NK cells. We evaluated the degranulation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity of NK cells in response to the infected keratinocytes. We observed a strong activation of NK cells by infected keratinocytes, despite minimal alterations in the expression of activating or inhibitory ligands on NK cell receptors. However, stimulation with recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a cytokine known to be present in significant quantities during chronic T. cruzi infections in the host, resulted in a substantial upregulation of these ligands on primary keratinocytes. Overall, our findings suggest the crucial role of NK cells in controlling acute T. cruzi infection in the upper layer of the skin and shed light on keratinocytes as potential initial targets of infection.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d34b94c64c1d1ef81dc9e133feb67879ac0b8ebb,d34b94c64c1d1ef81dc9e133feb67879ac0b8ebb,"Keshia Kroh, Jessica Barton, Helena Fehling, H.

"New occurrence of Triatoma costalimai Verano e Galvão, 1958 (Hemiptera, Triatominae) in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, a vector of Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas, 1909), endemic to the Brazilian Cerrado","The Triatominae subfamily (Hemiptera, Reduviidae) is a group widely distributed in the Neotropical region between the Great Lakes of North America and the province of Chubut in southern Argentina.

Extensible membrane nanotubules mediate attachment of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes under flow,"Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease, an important cause of infectious chronic myocardiopathy in Latin America. The life cycle of the parasite involves two main hosts: a triatomine (arthropod hematophagous vector) and a mammal. Epimastigotes are flagellated forms inside the triatomine gut; they mature in its intestine into metacyclic trypomastigotes, the infective form for humans. Parasites attach despite the shear stress generated by fluid flow in the intestines of the host, but little is known about the mechanisms that stabilize attachment in these conditions. Here, we describe the effect of varying levels of shear stress on attached T. cruzi epimastigotes using a parallel plate flow chamber. When flow is applied, parasites are partially dragged but maintain a connection to the surface via ~40 nm wide filaments (nanotubules) and the activity of flagella is reduced. When flow stops, parasites return near their original position and flagellar motion resumes. Nanotubule elongation increases with increasing shear stress and is consistent with a model of membrane tether extension under force. Fluorescent probes used to confirm membrane composition also show micron-wide anchoring pads at the distal end of the nanotubules. Multiple tethering accounts for more resistance to large shear stresses and for reduced flagellar movement when flow is stopped. The formation of membrane nanotubules is a possible mechanism to enhance adherence to host cells under shear stress, favoring the continuity of the parasite´s life cycle.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/81f466b243db9db363e1ddab7cc7049b95bdc7f2,81f466b243db9db363e1ddab7cc7049b95bdc7f2,"Cristhian David Perdomo-Gómez, Nancy E Ruiz-Uribe, John M.

Space-environment relationship in the identification of potential areas of expansion of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in Didelphis aurita in the Atlantic Rainforest,"Ecological Niche Modeling is widely used for animals, but rarely for understanding the parasite ecology. Trypanosoma cruzi is a heterogeneous and widely dispersed multi-host parasite. Didelphis aurita is a generalist species, both in terms of diet and environments. We modeled the D. aurita niche and T. cruzi infection in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, using the models of two common vector species (Triatoma vitticeps and Panstrongylus megistus) as biotic variables, predicting their occurrence. Records of T. cruzi infected and non-infected D. aurita were analyzed through climate and landscape approaches by the Ecoland method. Models for each triatomine species and infected and noninfected D. aurita were produced considering climate and landscape: resolution of ~1km2 selected by Pearson’s correlation [-0.7≤α≤0.7]. For modeling, seven algorithms available in ModleR package were used. True Skill Statistic was used to evaluate the models’ performance (≥ 0.7). T. vitticeps indicates that there is a spatial dependence with warm areas in the southeastern region while P. megistus presented a distribution with high environmental suitability concentrated in the Southeast. High values of climatic suitability, landscape and potential presence of T. vitticeps and P. megistus were considered necessary, but not sufficient for the presence of D. aurita infected by T. cruzi. Climate models showed an ecological niche with suitability variations homogeneous, and landscape models showed a distribution of habitat conditions along the biome, with a fragmented profile and heterogeneous between locations. Ecoland demonstrated that D. aurita has different degrees of impact on its role in the enzootic cycle in different locations of the Atlantic Rainforest. Associating the models with the Ecoland method allowed the recognition of areas where D. aurita are important T. cruzi reservoirs. Areas of high suitability for the presence of marsupials are a necessary, but not sufficient for D. aurita to act as a reservoir for T. cruzi.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/398d1df5b79e7779951c656d7f8589ca9cfa0d86,398d1df5b79e7779951c656d7f8589ca9cfa0d86,"Raphael Testai, Marinez Ferreira de Siqueira, D.

TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI INFECTION IN THREE SLENDER-TAILED MEERKATS (SURICATA SURICATTA),"Abstract: Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite primarily transmitted by triatomine insects (Hemiptera: subfamily Reduviidae) and is the cause of Chagas disease (CD). This report describes three cases of CD in a mob of five slender-tailed meerkats (Suricata suricatta) living in an outdoor exhibit at one zoological institution in Texas. The index case was a 9.5-yr-old female that presented with ataxia, lethargy, and pleural effusion. This case was diagnosed with CD postmortem via cytology, T. cruzi PCR of whole blood and lung fluid, and histology. Blood was opportunistically collected from the remaining four meerkats 28 d after the death of the index case and tested by PCR and serology. The second case was a clinically normal 7.5-yr-old male that tested PCR and antibody positive and the third case was a clinically normal 9-yr-old female that tested PCR positive. The second animal presented depressed, with pneumonia, and with continuous shivering 53 d after blood collection, and clinically improved after treatment with antibiotics and supportive care. Fifteen days later, the animal was found minimally responsive and died shortly thereafter. Histologic examination revealed Trypanosoma sp. amastigotes in the myocardium and the tissue was positive for T. cruzi DNA. The third meerkat, which received two separate courses of benznidazole over a span of almost 2 yr, was monitored routinely by PCR and serology and appeared clinically normal until found dead on exhibit 93 d after completion of the second treatment.

"Expression of Proteins, Glycoproteins, and Transcripts in the Guts of Fasting, Fed, and Trypanosoma cruzi-Infected Triatomines: A Systematic Review","Chagas disease is caused by the hemoflagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. The main transmission mechanism for the parasite in endemic areas is contact with the feces of an infected triatomine bug. Part of the life cycle of T. cruzi occurs in the digestive tract of triatomines, where vector and parasite engage in a close interaction at a proteomic–molecular level. This interaction triggers replication and differentiation processes in the parasite that can affect its infectivity for the vertebrate host. With the aim of compiling and analyzing information from indexed publications on transcripts, proteins, and glycoproteins in the guts of fasting, fed, and T. cruzi-infected triatomines in the period 2000–2022, a systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines.

Validation of a multiplex microsphere immunoassay for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies in dogs,"The vector-borne protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease in humans, dogs, and many other mammalian hosts. Canine Chagas disease is increasingly diagnosed in dogs of the southern US where triatomine insect vectors occur, and there are limited veterinary diagnostic options; currently, only the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test is offered at a single accredited diagnostic laboratory. This study evaluated a multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MIA) for detecting antibodies against T. cruzi in dogs and compared with existing serological methods to establish cut-off values and relative sensitivity/specificity. Dog sera (n=135) which were previously characterized using the IFA and off-label use of two commercial rapid assays were tested on the multiplex MIA against 12 different antigens: nine T. cruzi antigens, a negative control recombinant protein (green fluorescent protein), a Leishmania antigen, and a canine parvovirus antigen (used as an antibody control given near-ubiquitous parvovirus vaccination). For each sample, the ratio of median fluorescence intensity (MFI) for each T. cruzi antigen to that of GFP was calculated. Samples with an antigen/GFP ratio greater than 4 standard deviations above the mean of 25 known negative sera were considered positive on that antigen. Samples testing positive on 2 or more antigens were considered positive for T. cruzi antibodies. Compared to the IFA, the multiplex MIA demonstrated a relative sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96.97%. Given its precision, high-throughput format, potential for automation, and lack of subjective interpretation, the multiplex MIA should be considered a valid and improved assay for T. cruzi antibodies in dogs.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b453d0a1249cb4ad00211ff3e328d06ac22b352,5b453d0a1249cb4ad00211ff3e328d06ac22b352,"Carlos A.

Temporal assessment of entomological surveillance of Trypanosoma cruzi vectors in an endemic area of northeastern Brazil,"Entomological surveillance is essential for the control of triatomines and the prevention of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in humans and domestic animals. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate entomological indicators and triatomine control during the period from 2005 to 2015 in an endemic area in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. This observational and retrospective study was developed based on data analysis related to active entomological surveillance activities and chemical control of infested housing units (HU) in the Agreste mesoregion of the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, in the period between 2005 to 2015. The quantitative analysis of housing units surveyed for entomological indicators was performed by linear regression of random effects (p < 0.05). The effect of the number of HU surveyed on the entomological indicators was analyzed by fitting a linear random effects regression model and an increasing intradomiciliary colonization rate was significant. In the period evaluated 92,156 housing units were investigated and the presence of triatomines was reported in 4,639 (5.0%). A total of 4,653 specimens of triatomines were captured and the species recorded were Triatoma pseudomaculata (n = 1,775), Triatoma brasiliensis (n = 1,569), Rhodnius nasutus (n = 741) and Panstrongylus lutzi (n = 568), with an index of natural infection by T. cruzi of 2.2%. Only 53.1% of the infested HU were subjected to chemical control. Moreover, there was a decrease in the total number of HU surveyed over time associated with an increase in the index of intradomiciliary colonization (p = 0.004).

"Geographic Distribution of the Genus Panstrongylus Berg, 1879 in the Neotropic with Emphasis on Trypanosoma cruzi Vectors","Panstrongylus is a Neotropical taxa of 16 species, some more widespread than others, that act as vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (CD). This group is associated with mammalian reservoir niches. There are few studies of the biogeography and niche suitability of these triatomines. Using zoo-epidemiological occurrence databases, the distribution of Panstrongylus was determined based on bioclimatic modelling (DIVA GIS), parsimonious niche distribution (MAXENT), and parsimony analysis of endemic species (PAE). Through 517 records, a wide presence of P. geniculatus, P. rufotuberculatus, P. lignarius, and P. megistus was determined and recorded as frequent vectors of T. cruzi in rainforest habitats of 24–30 °C. These distributions were modeled with AUC >0.80 and <0.90, as well as with the seasonality of temperature, isothermality, and precipitation as relevant bioclimatic variables. Individual traces for each taxon in Panstrongylus—1036 records—showed widely dispersed lines for frequent vectors P. geniculatus, P. lignarius, P. rufotuberculatus, and P. megistus. Other occasional vectors showed more restricted dispersal, such as P. howardi, P. humeralis, P. lenti, P. lutzi, P. tupynambai, P. noireaiui, and P. chinai. Areas of defined environmental variation, geological change, and trans domain fluid fauna, such as the American Transition Zone and the Pacific Domain of Morrone, had the highest Panstrongylus diversity. Pan-biogeographic nodes appear to be areas of the greatest species diversity that act as corridors connecting biotopes and allowing fauna migration. Vicariance events in the geologic history of the continent need to be investigated. The geographical distribution of Panstrongylus overlapped with CD cases and Didelphis marsupialis/Dasypus novemcinctus presence, two important reservoirs in Central and South America.

Natural Trypanosoma cruzi Infection and Climatic Season Influence the Developmental Capacity in Field-Caught Mepraia spinolai Nymphs,"Simple Summary Triatomines are hemimetabolous and hematophagous insect vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The life cycle of triatomines is composed of five nymphal stages and an adult stage. The wild kissing bug Mepraia spinolai is distributed in a vast area of the semiarid Mediterranean ecosystem of South America, characterized by strongly marked seasons. The population structure of this vector changes during the different seasons, suggesting its development is controlled under natural conditions. In this study, we performed a biological assay to study this vector development after two laboratory feedings. We collected nymphs, first to fourth instars, in eight M. spinolai populations during the transition of late fall to winter (cooling period) and spring (warming period) of three consecutive years. The gathered information with vectors molting twice suggests that development is differentially controlled in nymphs from first and fourth instars depending on the climatic period of collection. Additionally, T. cruzi infection changes development forward only in nymphs of second and fourth instars of the warming period. Our findings suggest that the effect of the climatic period and T. cruzi infection on the development of this vector species is a stage-dependent phenomenon. Abstract In this study, we evaluated the effect of the climatic season and infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, etiological agent of Chagas disease, on the molting capacity of the triatomine vector Mepraia spinolai endemic to Chile. We used wild-caught first-to-fourth instar nymphs during cooling (fall and winter) and warming (spring) periods. After capturing, nymphs were fed at the laboratory, and maintained under optimal rearing conditions. Feeding was repeated 40 days later. We followed-up the molting events on 709 nymphs, recording one, two or the absence of molts after two feeding opportunities. Within the same climatic period, only infected second- and fourth-instar nymphs from the warming period showed a larger proportion of double molting compared to uninfected nymphs. Regarding the climatic period, infected and uninfected first- and fourth-instar nymphs exhibited a larger proportion of double molting in the warming and cooling periods, respectively. The pattern of non-molting nymph occurrence suggests they probably reach diapause by environmental stochasticity. The effect of the climatic period and T. cruzi infection on the development of M. spinolai is an instar-dependent phenomenon, highlighting the occurrence of finely synchronized processes at different moments of the life cycle of such an hemimetabolous insect as triatomines.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4dd99c2ef137ad6dd7d858f88905c903cba6bf04,4dd99c2ef137ad6dd7d858f88905c903cba6bf04,"Juan Botzotz, Gabriel Méndez-Valdés, Sylvia Ortíz, Angélica López, C.

Wild mammals involved in the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi and food sources of Triatoma sherlocki in an endemic region of northeastern Brazil,"The present study, carried out in the municipality of Gentio do Ouro, Bahia, Brazil aimed to evaluate which wild mammals may be involved in the transmission of T. cruzi and which are the blood sources for triatomines collected in the study area. PCR analysis of 31 wild mammals captured revealed T. cruzi infection in 6.4% (2/31): one specimen of the opossum Didelphis albiventris (1/3) and one of the rodent Kerodon rupestris (1/5); despite being more frequent in the area, no specimen of the rodent Thrichomys sp. (0/23) was infected. A total of 169 triatomines were captured. The conclusive detection of food sources was possible only for Triatoma sherlocki Papa et al., 2002 (n = 56), with evidence for: K. rupestris (35.7%), Gallus (17.9%), D. albiventris (14.3%), Homo sapiens (14.3%), Tropidurus hispidus (7.1%), Leopardus geoffroyi (5.3%), Conepatus semistriatus (1.8%), Thrichomys inermis (1.8%) and Rattus norvegicus (1.8%). Triatomines of the species T. sherlocki showed food eclecticism, including feeding on humans, with some of them being captured at dwellings. These facts make this triatomine a potential link for the transmission of T. cruzi between wild and anthropic environments, highlighting a latent risk of the reemergence of Chagas disease outbreaks.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/867bae95fc86cb9620e7fab237dc6bda60f957ec,867bae95fc86cb9620e7fab237dc6bda60f957ec,"Flavia Santos, J.

An effective internet-based system for surveillance and elimination of triatomine insects: AlertaChirimacha,"Vector-borne diseases remain a significant public health threat in many regions of the world. Traditional vector surveillance and control methods have relied on active and passive surveillance programs, which are often costly and time-consuming. New internet-based vector surveillance systems have shown promise in removing some of the cost and labor burden from health authorities. We developed and evaluated the effectiveness of a new internet-based surveillance system, “AlertaChirimacha”, for detecting Triatoma infestans (known locally by its Quechua name, Chirimacha), the Chagas disease vector, in the city of Arequipa, Peru. In the first 26 months post-implementation, AlertaChirimacha received 206 reports of residents suspecting or fearing triatomines in their homes or neighborhoods, of which we confirmed, through pictures or inspections, 11 (5.3%) to be Triatoma infestans. After microscopic examination, none of the specimens collected were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. AlertaChirimacha received 57% more confirmed reports than the traditional surveillance system and detected 10% more infested houses than active and passive surveillance approaches combined. Through in-depth interviews we evaluate the reach, bilateral engagement, and response promptness and efficiency of AlertaChirimacha. Our study highlights the potential of internet-based vector surveillance systems, such as AlertaChirimacha, to improve vector surveillance and control efforts in resource-limited settings. This approach could decrease the cost and time horizon for the elimination of vector-mediated Chagas disease in the region.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/104efeb742c52d417ac9807ef6506486bdcd3410,104efeb742c52d417ac9807ef6506486bdcd3410,"Laura D Tamayo, C.

Effectiveness of fluralaner treatment regimens for the control of canine Chagas disease: A mathematical modeling study,"Background Canine Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by insect triatomine vectors known as kissing bugs. The agent can cause cardiac damage and long-term heart disease and death in humans, dogs, and other mammals. In laboratory settings, treatment of dogs with systemic insecticides has been shown to be highly efficacious at killing triatomines that feed on treated dogs. Method We developed compartmental vector-host models of T. cruzi transmission between the triatomine and dog population accounting for the impact of seasonality and triatomine migration on disease transmission dynamics. We considered a single vector-host model without seasonality, and model with seasonality, and a spatially coupled model. We used the models to evaluate the effectiveness of the insecticide fluralaner with different durations of treatment regimens for reducing T. cruzi infection in different transmission settings. Results In low and medium transmission settings, our model showed a marginal difference between the 3-month and 6-month regimens for reducing T. cruzi infection among dogs. The difference increases in the presence of seasonality and triatomine migration from a sylvatic transmission setting. In high transmission settings, the 3-month regimen was substantially more effective in reducing T. cruzi infections in dogs than the other regimens. Our model showed that increased migration rate reduces fluralaner effectiveness in all treatment regimens, but the relative reduction in effectiveness is minimal during the first years of treatment. However, if an additional 10% or more of triatomines killed by dog treatment were eaten by dogs, treatment could increase T. cruzi infections in the dog population at least during the first year of treatment. Conclusion Our analysis shows that treating all peridomestic dogs every three to six months for at least five years could be an effective measure to reduce T. cruzi infections in dogs and triatomines in peridomestic transmission settings. However, further studies at the local scale are needed to better understand the potential impact of routine use of fluralaner treatment on increasing dogs’ consumption of dead triatomines.",2023,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6847625558e3a83814d39f52dd43c5380db51170,6847625558e3a83814d39f52dd43c5380db51170,"Edem Fiatsonu, Rachel E.

Severe Chagas disease in Ecuador: a countrywide geodemographic epidemiological analysis from 2011 to 2021,"Background Chagas disease is a neglected and often forgotten tropical disease caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite can be transmitted through the direct contact of human skin with feces and urine of the triatomine insect. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 6–7 million people are infected worldwide, killing at least 14,000 every year. The disease has been reported in 20 of the 24 provinces of Ecuador, with El Oro, Guayas, and Loja being the most affected. Methodology We analyzed the morbidity and mortality rates of severe Chagas disease in Ecuador on a nationwide, population-based level. Hospitalization cases and deaths were also examined based on altitude, including low (< 2,500 m) and high (> 2,500 m) altitudes, according to the International Society. Data was retrieved from the National Institute of Statistics and Census hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality databases from 2011 to 2021. Results A total of 118 patients have been hospitalized in Ecuador since 2011 due to Chagas disease. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 69.4% (N = 82). Men have a higher incidence rate (4.8/1,000,000) than women, although women have a significantly higher mortality rate than men (6.9/1,000,000). Conclusion Chagas disease is a severe parasitic condition that primarily affects rural and poorer areas of Ecuador. Men are more likely to be infected due to differences in work and sociocultural activities. Using average elevation data, we conducted a geodemographic analysis to assess incidence rates by altitude. Our findings indicate that the disease is more common at low and moderate altitudes, but recent increases in cases at higher altitudes suggest that environmental changes, such as global warming, could be driving the proliferation of disease-carrying vectors in previously unaffected areas.",2023,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66eaf10bdd57fd887297ce1765db69b691d263a9,66eaf10bdd57fd887297ce1765db69b691d263a9,"Jorge Vásconez-González, Juan S.

Stronger control-surveillance systems for vector-borne Chagas disease,"The multinational initiatives for the control/surveillance of Chagas launched by disease-endemic countries and the Pan American Health Organization-World Health Organization (PAHO-WHO) contributed to control house-infesting triatomine-bug populations and to reduce disease incidence. However, after 30 years, Chagas disease (CD) transmission persists the Americas. In their recent review, Rojas de Arias et al.(1) highlight the ‘practical impossibility’ of interrupting vector-borne Trypanosoma cruzi transmission, due to the zoonotic nature of most transmission cycles, with well over 100 vector species widely spread across the Americas. Then, Rojas de Arias et al.(1) emphasise the need for stronger surveillance systems to monitor and control CD. Here, I will (1) briefly discuss the prospects for interrupting vector-borne T. cruzi transmission and (2) provide an overview of some innovative approaches that, I believe, can play important roles in the development and operation of stronger control-surveillance systems for vector-borne CD. Disease control needs clear goals, and those goals often heavily depend on the natural history, risk factors, transmission routes and dynamics, pathogenesis, and treatment of the disease. Eradication, elimination, reduction of incidence, reduction of the number of severe cases, and reduction of fatality rates are all possible goals of disease control programs. (2) The most ambitious goal is disease eradication the complete elimination of an infection, with no new cases recorded in the absence of control measures. Eradication is practically impossible for zoonoses such as CD, whose etiological agent can be transmitted by 150+ vector species and infects a wide range of wild vertebrate hosts from the USA to Patagonia.(3) Therefore, the objective of a CD control program cannot be eradication, at least in the Americas. The main goal of the multinational initiatives against CD was the elimination of the strongly synanthropic, non-native populations of a few “primary” vectors mainly Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus.(4) Elimination of R. prolixus from Mexico and some countries of Central America was certified in 2011 by PAHO/WHO, but R. prolixus-infested houses were detected in rural sites in Mexico after certification.(5) Moreover, a new record of T. infestans in Mexico was recorded after 50 years.(6) In Peru, non-native T. infestans populations were not controlled in Arequipa (see references in Rojas de Arias et al.(1)). In addition, T. infestans residual foci have been detected in Brazil after certification.(7) Overall, these data indicate that elimination of non-native populations of “primary” vectors is feasible, but has many challenges. Elimination may not be the best goal for native vectors of CD.(8,9) There is a high species richness of Triatominae in the Americas.(3) Moreover, it is important to highlight that the response of some native species to vector control with insecticides was not the same as that observed for non-native species. In Brazil, for example, insecticide spraying reduced dramatically T. infestans distribution, but no significant reduction in distribution was observed for most native species. Moreover, the interruption of chemical treatment was systematically followed by recolonisation of native species,(10) mainly in unplastered houses.(11) In the state of Bahia, there was a clear reduction in the distribution of T. infestans and an increase in the relative abundance and distribution of T. sordida and T. pseudomaculata after 40 years of the vectorcontrol program. The high frequency of native triatomine species invading houses in the Americas in recent years(7,12,13) highlights the need to reinforce entomological surveillance actions to prevent CD. WHO established goals for controlling CD by 2030, including the interruption of transmission through vectorial, transfusion, transplantation and congenital routes in many endemic countries.(14) Achieving those goals is feasible for non-vector-borne transmission,(15) but many challenges remain for vector-borne transmission. Thus, I agree with de Rojas Arias et al.(1) that the WHO 2030 goal of interrupting vector-borne transmission seems unfeasible because: (i) wild triatomine populations are widespread, (ii) surveillance methods for synanthropic triatomines are not perfect, and (iii) CD still has low visibility and priority. Thus, it is necessary to reinforce the surveillance of vector-borne transmission of CD. In the next paragraphs I will highlight some innovative strategies that could help strengthen this surveillance: (I) online training for health agents (II) development of apps to identify vectors and improve surveillance with community participation and citizen science, (III) vector-borne transmission-risk mapping.",2023,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fa1818c05fd6f097382ba1499457595b0d6de12,8fa1818c05fd6f097382ba1499457595b0d6de12,R.

A comprehensive review on potential candidates for the treatment of chagas disease,"Twenty different infectious disorders induced by bacteria, viruses, and parasites are categorized as neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) by WHO. The severity of chagas disease remains a major concern in endemic areas and an emerging public health hazard in nonendemic countries. Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of this NTD, is mostly transmitted by triatomine vectors and comprises a range of epidemiologically significant variants. Current chemotherapeutics are obsolete, and one of the primary reasons for treatment cessation is their poor safety and effectiveness. Due to the aforementioned challenges, researchers are now focusing on discovering alternative novel safe, and economically reachable therapies for the treatment of trypanosomiasis. Certain target‐based drugs that target specific biochemical processes of the causative parasites have been described as potential antichagasic agents that possesses various types of heterocyclic scaffolds. These flexible molecules have a wide range of biological actions, and various synthesized compounds with strong activity have been documented. This review aims to discuss the available literature on synthetic anti‐T. cruzi drugs that will give a food for thought to medicinal chemists thriving to design and develop such drugs. Furthermore, some of the studies discussed herein are concerned with the potential of novel drugs to block new viable sites in T. cruzi.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9cbf20b330ab6da8d0bc7e7f8a340eac61a57b2b,9cbf20b330ab6da8d0bc7e7f8a340eac61a57b2b,"Shilpi Pathak, Muskan Bhardwaj, N.

"Canine Systemic Insecticides Fluralaner and Lotilaner Induce Acute Mortality of Triatoma gerstaeckeri, North American Vector of the Chagas Disease Parasite","ABSTRACT. Chagas disease is a health concern for humans and animals across the Americas, and control options targeting the triatomine vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, are limited. Host-targeted interventions may be a useful and underused tool in controlling the spread of T. cruzi from vectors to hosts. Domestic dogs are known to be key bloodmeal hosts for triatomines as well as T. cruzi reservoirs and may be an effective and practical target for host-targeted insecticide deployment. We hypothesized that treating dogs with commercially available systemic insecticides (labeled for flea and tick control) would result in mortality of triatomines after consuming treated blood. We enrolled 16 privately owned dogs into five treatment groups to receive either fluralaner (Bravecto) or lotilaner (Credelio), alone or in combination with ivermectin. Blood from dogs before the initiation of treatment served as controls. Blood was collected 0, 7, 30, 45, and 90 days after the initial canine insecticide treatment and fed to 10 Triatoma gerstaeckeri nymphs through a membrane feeder, and survival was tracked daily for 7 days and weekly thereafter. All triatomines in the control and ivermectin groups survived the initial period, with no significant difference in long-term survival. In contrast, 99.7% of triatomines that fed on blood from dogs treated with either fluralaner or lotilaner died within 3 days. Although the impact of canine treatment on suppressing vector populations is unknown, fluralaner and lotilaner appear to be a compelling option for an integrated vector management approach to triatomine control.",2023,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/946a3ab7728f99a98ac98b5407338369930cd4b3,946a3ab7728f99a98ac98b5407338369930cd4b3,"Rachel E.

"Occurrence and distribution of Panstrongylus megistus (Burmeister, 1835) (Hemiptera, Reduviidae) in a metropolitan area of Southern Brazil","ABSTRACT Two triatomine genera (Panstrongylus and Triatoma) have essentially been recorded in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. Panstrongylus megistus should be highlighted since this species is one of the main vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi in Brazil, due to its wide geographical distribution and the high susceptibility to this protozoan. This study aimed to present not only the occurrence and distribution of P. megistus in the Porto Alegre city’s metropolitan area (PAMA), Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, but also the rates of T. cruzi infection, from 2009 to 2020. The PAMA, which comprises 34 cities and 4.4 million habitants, extends across the transition area in two biomes – Pampa and Mata Atlantica – found in the state. Results showed that P. megistus was recorded in 76.5% of cities (i.e., 26 out of 34), mainly in Porto Alegre city, where the vector was found in 11 out of the 12 years that were monitored. Three hundred and nineteen specimens were captured. Two hundred and sixty-seven specimens (83.7%) were located intradomicile (p < 0.0001), while 52.3% positivity for T. cruzi was found. Thus, P. megistus is important in the PAMA, because it invades and colonizes the households.

"Accidental importation of the vector of Chagas disease, Triatoma rubrofasciata (De Geer, 1773) (Hemiptera, Reduviidae, Triatominae), in Europe","Members of the subfamily Triatominae (Hemiptera; Reduviidae) are vectors of American trypanosomiasis, also called Chagas disease. These insects feed on blood and are capable of transmitting protozoa belonging to the genus Trypanosoma (Kinetoplastea), with T. cruzi (Chagas, 1909) being the most important vector for human and companion animal disease. Vector-borne transmission can occur through contamination of a mucous membrane or a skin opening by triatomine fecal material after a bite. Another important means of transmission is oral ingestion of contaminated unpasteurized food or drink that contains the triatomine insect or its fecal material. Most species of Triatoninae are distributed in the Americas, but a few are found in the Far East and India. One of them, Triatoma rubrofasciata, is widely distributed worldwide (Dujardin et al. 2015). The unique reference to T. rubrofasciata near Europe is from the island of Santa Maria, the southeastern-most in the Azores archipelago with a humid subtropical climate. The assignment of its presence to Europe (Schofield and Galvão 2009) would be confusing or erroneous due to the location of this Portuguese archipelago with respect to North Africa and Europe, in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. The first known citation there occurred in 1979 (Lent and Wygodzinsky 1979), but the authors did not refer to any collection data (point/date). The presence of T. rubrofasciata seems stable in the Azores, as it was included as part of the fauna of the island of Santa Maria in 2010 but, surprisingly, the species has not been collected in the rest of the islands, although it has remained in the Azores for at least 31 years (1979-2010) (Borges et al. 2010). Triatoma rubriofasciata is considered to be a poor vector of T. cruzi and it was associated with transmission in only three cases in the Americas (Lent and Wygodzinsky 1979) but not in China or Vietnam, where the species is more abundant (Hieu et al. 2019), thus it is rarely associated with T. cruzi transmission. This may be due to the long defecation timing of this species that lowers the transmission possibility to mammal hosts (Braga and Lima 1999). Nevertheless, in the Far East, this species has become a public health problem due to the numerous bites that can become more severe by swelling, itching, and secondary infection (Hieu et al. 2019, Shi et al. 2020). Several anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in Hawaii and China, (Wang and Peng 2006, Anderson and Belnap 2015). In the Far East, T. rubrofasciata is found in all habitat types, especially in urban and peri-urban and to a lesser extent in rural areas (Dujardin et al. 2015, Hieu et al. 2019). In buildings, vector abundance decreases with increasing floor levels (Hieu et al. 2019). The specimen was studied morphologically and the taxonomical identification was conducted on the basis of the key diagnostic characters (Lent and Wygodzinsky 1979):",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9f7576b5d75d28b8920cffc3562fc6d68015641c,9f7576b5d75d28b8920cffc3562fc6d68015641c,"F.

Metacyclogenesis as the Starting Point of Chagas Disease,"Chagas disease is a neglected infectious disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, primarily transmitted by triatomine vectors, and it threatens approximately seventy-five million people worldwide. This parasite undergoes a complex life cycle, transitioning between hosts and shifting from extracellular to intracellular stages. To ensure its survival in these diverse environments, T. cruzi undergoes extreme morphological and molecular changes. The metacyclic trypomastigote (MT) form, which arises from the metacyclogenesis (MTG) process in the triatomine hindgut, serves as a crucial link between the insect and human hosts and can be considered the starting point of Chagas disease.

Metabolomics of developmental changes in Triatoma sanguisuga gut microbiota,"Triatoma sanguisuga is one of the major vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi in the southeastern US, where it sustains a robust zoonotic parasite transmission cycle and occasional human infections. A better understanding of triatomine development may allow for alternative approaches to insecticide-based vector control. Indeed, the role of the gut microbiota and bacterial endosymbionts in triatomine development and in their vectorial capacity is emerging. We investigated here the differences in microbiota among nymph and adult T. sanguisuga, to shed light on the metabolomic interactions occurring during development. Microbiota composition was assessed by 16s gene amplification and deep sequencing from field-caught adult bugs and their laboratory-raised progeny. Significant differences in microbiota bacterial diversity and composition were observed between nymphs and adults. Laboratory-raised nymphs showed a higher taxonomic diversity, and at least seven families predominated. On the other hand, field-caught adults had a lower bacterial diversity and four families comprised most of the microbiota. These differences in compositions were associated with differences in predicted metabolism, with laboratory-raised nymphs microbiota metabolizing a limited diversity of carbon sources, with potential for resource competition between bacterial families, and the production of lactic acid as a predominant fermentation product. On the other hand, field-caught adult microbiota was predicted to metabolize a broader diversity of carbon sources, with complementarity rather than competition among taxa, and produced a diverse range of products in a more balanced manner. The restricted functionality of laboratory-raised nymph microbiota may be associated with their poor development in captivity, and further understanding of the metabolic interactions at play may lead to alternative vector control strategies targeting triatomine microbiota.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e5ddb4a57345b1a6c3664e92be8dd54b7a7b156,3e5ddb4a57345b1a6c3664e92be8dd54b7a7b156,"Evan Teal, Claudia P Herrera, Eric Dumonteil"
A qualitative exploration of knowledge of Chagas disease among adolescents in rural Ecuador.,"INTRODUCTION
Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease that affects 6 to 7 million people worldwide. In South America, CD is a major health problem in several regions, causing more than 12 000 deaths per year. CD is caused by a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi, mostly transmitted through the contaminated feces of certain species of triatomine bug, commonly known as the 'kissing bug'. CD is endemic in Loja province in the southern region of Ecuador, where triatomines have been found in 68% of communities. Previous promotion of healthy practices in Loja province have included educational programs directed toward youth to affirm cultural and social norms that support health and prevent CD transmission. The present study was designed to evaluate current knowledge related to CD among youth in the three communities of Loja province following previous intervention programs.


METHODS
A descriptive, qualitative approach was applied using individual semi-structured interviews with 14 young people (eight females, six males) from three rural communities in Loja province. Interviews assessed knowledge about CD transmission, knowledge about the parasite-vector-disease pathway, and the role of youth in preventing Chagas disease in their communities.


RESULTS
Following a thematic analysis of the data, the study results showed there is cursory knowledge of the triatomine insect that can carry the causative parasite for CD. Participants were able to generally talk about the vector, habitat and prevention practices for triatomine infestation. Nevertheless, limited understanding of transmission dynamics in the parasite-vector-disease pathway itself was found. One major finding was that prevention practices were not correctly applied or followed, increasing the risk of exposure in the community. Youth also articulated that CD is stigmatized in their communities, which may be a barrier for prevention efforts.


CONCLUSION
Gaps in knowledge about the parasite-vector-disease pathway were identified among youth. Overall, youth responses indicated positive regard for prevention practices and a desire to be involved in prevention programs. Developing educational programs focusing on CD transmission may be needed to improve control and prevention of this parasitic disease. The implications of these findings are discussed for developing effective control programs in the region.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10ddde031026b70e1bc50f1b13b1c7d868357edf,10ddde031026b70e1bc50f1b13b1c7d868357edf,"Patricia Mora-Criollo, M.

A Scoping Review of Mathematical Models Used to Investigate the Role of Dogs in Chagas Disease Transmission,"Simple Summary Chagas disease- caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and vectored by triatomine insects (‘kissing bugs’)- poses a serious threat to human and dog health. Mathematical modeling is an important tool to assess control interventions and determine how different factors affect disease transmission. In the Chagas disease transmission cycle, the application of mathematical modeling techniques to study the role of dogs in disease epidemiology and control has not been fully understood. The purpose of this study was to review mathematical models that investigated the role of dogs in Chagas disease transmission. We examine the modeling approaches used, assess their contribution to understanding dogs’ role in Chagas disease transmission and control, and discuss their strengths and limitations. We identified ten peer-reviewed articles. Five of the ten reviewed articles focused on evaluating the effectiveness of intervention measures to control disease transmission and three focused on estimating disease transmission risk. The reviewed studies show that dogs are not only at high risk of infection but also amplify the spread of infections in endemic areas. Moreover, these studies have demonstrated that eliminating infected dogs from households or frequent use of insecticide could be sufficient to nearly interrupt disease transmission. Abstract Chagas disease is a zoonotic vector-borne disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which affects a variety of mammalian species across the Americas, including humans and dogs. Mathematical modeling has been widely used to investigate the transmission dynamics and control of vector-borne diseases. We performed a scoping review of mathematical models that investigated the role of dogs in T. cruzi transmission. We identified ten peer-reviewed papers that have explicitly modeled the role of dogs in Chagas transmission dynamics. We discuss the different methods employed in these studies, the different transmission metrics, disease transmission routes, and disease control strategies that have been considered and evaluated. In general, mathematical modeling studies have shown that dogs are not only at high risk of T. cruzi infection but are also major contributors to T. cruzi transmission to humans. Moreover, eliminating infected dogs from households or frequent use of insecticide was shown to be effective for curtailing T. cruzi transmission in both humans and dogs. However, when insecticide spraying is discontinued, T. cruzi infections in dogs were shown to return to their pre-spraying levels. We discuss the challenges and opportunities for future modeling studies to improve our understanding of Chagas disease transmission dynamics and control.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/13b34168ad392096a327f4073e14126918761dec,13b34168ad392096a327f4073e14126918761dec,"Edem Fiatsonu, Rachel E.

"Vector mapping and bloodmeal metabarcoding demonstrate risk of urban Chagas disease transmission in Caracas, Venezuela","Chagas disease is a significant public health risk in rural and semi-rural areas of Venezuela. Triatomine infection by the aetiological agent Trypanosoma cruzi is also observed in the Metropolitan District of Caracas (MDC), where foodborne T. cruzi outbreaks occasionally occur but active vector-to-human transmission (infection during triatomine bloodmeal) is considered absent. Citizen science-based domiciliary triatomine collection carried out between 2007 and 2013 in the MDC has advanced understanding of urban T. cruzi prevalence patterns and represents an important public awareness-building tool. The present study reports on the extension of this triatomine collection program from 2014 to 2019 and uses mitochondrial metabarcoding to assess feeding behavior in a subset of specimens. The combined, thirteen-year dataset (n = 4872) shows a high rate of T. cruzi infection (75.2%) and a predominance of Panstrongylus geniculatus (99.01%) among triatomines collected in domiciliary areas by MDC inhabitants. Collection also involved nymphal stages of P. geniculatus in 18 of 32 MDC parishes. Other collected species included Triatoma nigromaculata, Triatoma maculata, Rhodnius prolixus, and Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus. Liquid intestinal content indicative of bloodmeal was observed in 53.4% of analyzed specimens. Dissection pools representing 108 such visually blooded P. geniculatus specimens predominantly tested positive for human cytochrome b DNA (22 of 24 pools). Additional bloodmeal sources detected via metabarcoding analysis included key sylvatic T. cruzi reservoirs (opossum and armadillo), rodents, and various other synanthropic and domesticated animals. Results suggest a porous sylvatic-domiciliary transmission interface and ongoing adaptation of P. geniculatus to the urban ecotope. Although P. geniculatus defecation traits greatly limit the possibility of active T. cruzi transmission for any individual biting event, the cumulation of this low risk across a vast metropolitan population warrants further investigation. Efforts to prevent triatomine contact with human food sources also clearly require greater attention to protect Venezuela’s capital from Chagas disease.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/60f9aaf6165e7419aa28c9a6e77180fb27d46087,60f9aaf6165e7419aa28c9a6e77180fb27d46087,"Maikell J Segovia, P.

Assessing the impact of host predation with Holling II response on the transmission of Chagas disease,"Chagas disease is a zoonosis caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by a broad range of blood-sucking triatomine species. Recently, it is recognized that the parasite can also be transmitted by host ingestion. In this paper, we propose a Chagas disease model incorporating two transmission routes of biting-defecation and host predation between vectors and hosts with Holling II functional response. The basic reproduction number R_v of triatomine population and basic reproduction numbers R_0 of disease population are derived analytically, and it is shown that they are insufficient to serve as threshold quantities to determine dynamics of the model. Our results have revealed the phenomenon of bistability, with backward and forward bifurcations. Specifically, if R_v>1, the dynamic is rather simple, namely, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable as R_0<1 and a unique endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable as R_0>1. However, if R_v<1, there exists a backward bifurcation with one unstable and one stable positive vector equilibria, and bistability phenomenon occurs, revealing that different initial conditions may lead to disease extinction or persistence even if the corresponding R_0>1. In conclusion, predation transmission in general reduces the risk of Chagas disease, whilst it makes the complexity of Chagas disease transmission, requiring an integrated strategy for the prevention and control of Chagas disease.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66435b55cc21ae9f91267c3a579fa7191f406631,66435b55cc21ae9f91267c3a579fa7191f406631,"Jiahao Jiang, Daozhou Gao, Jiao Jiang, Xiaotian Wu"
An Outbreak of Acute Chagas Disease Possibly Spread through Oral Transmission Involving Animal Reservoirs in Eastern Colombia.,"Chagas disease (CD) is a parasitic infection caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Reports of CD cases associated with oral transmission have increased, particularly in Colombia, Brazil, and Venezuela. In this investigation, parasitological, serological, and molecular tests were conducted on samples obtained from humans, mammal reservoirs, and hosts involved in the assessment of a suspected oral transmission outbreak in Cubara, Boyaca, Colombia. Seropositivity was observed in 60% (3 of 5) of index patients and 6.4% (5 of 78) of close contacts. Trypanosoma cruzi DNA was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 100% of index cases, 6.4% (5 of 78) of close contacts, 60% (6 of 10) of canines, and 100% (5 of 5) of opossums. In all index cases, the TcI lineage was identified, along with two cases of mixed infection (TcI/TcII-TcVI). Hemoculture revealed a flagellate presence in 80% of opossums, whereas all triatomine bugs tested negative. Our findings suggest a potential oral transmission route through contamination with opossum secretions.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f92b73cf8a066284dfdbda49f58a7ebaeb56f059,f92b73cf8a066284dfdbda49f58a7ebaeb56f059,"Stivenn A Gutiérrez, Jeiczon Jaimes-Dueñez, Lissa Cruz-Saavedra, C.

"Biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment follow‐up, and prediction of cardiac complications in Chagas disease in chronic phase: Recent advances","Chagas disease is caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite and is transmitted by infected triatomine bugs. This infection affects approximately 8 million people in the Americas, and due to globalisation and displacement, it is becoming increasingly common to find infected patients worldwide. Diagnosis of the disease in its acute form is relatively simple, as the parasite can be detected in peripheral blood smears, and symptoms are visible. However, in its chronic condition, the parasite is almost undetectable, and indirect tests are necessary to determine the presence of antibodies in infected patients. It is important to note that a single test is not enough to confirm the disease in this phase, as a second serological test should confirm the diagnosis. If the results are contradictory, a third test should be performed to confirm or discard the disease. Unfortunately, laboratories may not have access to all necessary tests in many rural areas where the disease is more frequent. Rapid tests to diagnose this disease present problems, such as significant variations in sensitivity and specificity in different countries. Therefore, searching for new biomarkers that allow for optimal correlation is essential. In this work, we have searched scientific literature from the last 10 years for mentions of novel biomarkers for diagnosis, treatment follow‐up, and prediction of cardiac complications in Chagas disease in its chronic phase.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/903117d3591fb1be7c46f26a3c2931d8c7d91889,903117d3591fb1be7c46f26a3c2931d8c7d91889,"M.

"Histology and histochemistry of the accessory gland of the female reproductive tract of Rhodnius neglectus Lent, 1954 (Hemiptera: Reduviidae).","Rhodnius neglectus is a wild triatomine, vector of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas' disease, and feeds on the blood of small mammals, being essential for its growth and reproduction. Accessory glands of the female reproductive tract are important in insect reproduction, but their anatomy and histology in R. neglectus are poorly studied. The aim of this work was to describe the histology and histochemistry of the accessory gland of the female reproductive tract of R. neglectus. The reproductive tract of five females of R. neglectus was dissected and the accessory glands transferred to Zamboni's fixative solution, dehydrated in a crescent series of ethanol, embedded in historesin, sectioned at 2 µm thick, stained with toluidine blue for histological analysis or mercury bromophenol blue for detection of total proteins. The accessory gland R. neglectus is tubular, without branches, opening in the dorsal region of the vagina and differing along its length in proximal and distal regions. In the proximal region, the gland is lined by the cuticle with a layer of columnar cells associated with muscle fibers. In the distal region of the gland, the epithelium has spherical secretory cells with terminal apparatus and conducting canaliculi opening in the lumen through pores in the cuticle. Proteins were identified in the gland lumen, terminal apparatus, nucleus and cytoplasm of secretory cells. The histology of the R. neglectus gland is similar to that found in other species of this genus, but with variations in the shape and size of its distal region.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5ece42c5c3912f22b45e2c80d9857bdd536f468f,5ece42c5c3912f22b45e2c80d9857bdd536f468f,"D.

Analysis of the Perception of Brazilian Medical Students about Chagas Disease,"Considering that health professionals at Brazil had doubts about the entomoepidemiological issues of Chagas disease (CD), and that many of them highlighted not feeling totally safe for clinical care, the knowledge of 281 Brazilian medical students was evaluated through a cross-sectional, descriptive, prospective, and quantitative research. Most students demonstrated that they knew about the etiological agent of CD (Trypanosoma cruzi), since 279 students answered the questionnaire correctly. Furthermore, the medical students demonstrated knowledge of the main form of transmission of the parasite, as 278 students associated CD transmission with triatomines. On the other hand, approximately 25 students did not associate CD transmission with triatomine feces. Besides that, these future health professionals had difficulties in relation to the treatment of CD, as more than half of the students (176) wrongly answered that CD “is not curable” or “is curable in the chronic phase”. Based on the results obtained that point out the difficulties medical students have with CD, there is a need for undergraduate medical courses to address the neglected diseases holistically because the National Curriculum Guidelines for the medical course require the training of competent health professionals capable of integrating the biological, psychological, social, and environmental dimensions.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b9d39b00c2bf9b889f6a8785eb7ae6365c677ea7,b9d39b00c2bf9b889f6a8785eb7ae6365c677ea7,"Everton Rodrigues Clovis, D.

Effectiveness of Systemic Insecticide Dog Treatment for the Control of Chagas Disease in the Tropics,"Simple Summary Chagas disease, a vector-borne disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant threat to human and canine health in the tropics. To control the transmission of T. cruzi, systemic insecticide treatment of dogs with fluralaner has been proposed as an intervention for canine and potentially human Chagas disease. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of canine treatment regimens with fluralaner to reduce Chagas disease infections (once every three months and once every twelve months) in high and low endemic regions using a data-driven mathematical model. Our study shows that Fluralaner treatment can effectively reduce T. cruzi transmission in humans, but may increase infections in dogs if canine consumption of triatomine increases. The effectiveness of the treatment regimen was shown to vary substantially with the underlying intensity of T. cruzi transmission and the increased rate of canine consumption of dead triatomines. Our study provides new evidence to support further empirical studies on the potential impact of mass treatment of dogs with systemic insecticides as a novel and additional intervention for the control and elimination of Chagas disease in the tropics. Abstract Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by triatomines, can lead to severe cardiac issues and mortality in many mammals. Recent studies have shown that systemic insecticide treatment of dogs is highly effective in killing triatomines. Here, we assessed the impact of dog treatment on T. cruzi transmission. We developed a mathematical model of T. cruzi transmission among triatomines, dogs, humans, and rodents. We used the model to evaluate the impact of dog treatment regimens on T. cruzi transmission dynamics to determine their effectiveness in reducing T. cruzi infection among hosts. We show that a 3-month treatment regimen may reduce T. cruzi incidence among humans by 59–80% in a high transmission setting, and 26–82% in a low transmission setting. An annual treatment may reduce incidence among humans by 49–74% in a high transmission setting, and by 11–76% in a low transmission setting. However, dog treatment may substantially increase T. cruzi prevalence among dogs if dog consumption of dead triatomines increases. Our model indicates that dog treatment may reduce T. cruzi infections among humans, but it may increase infections in dogs. Therefore, a holistic approach targeting different hosts is necessary for Chagas elimination.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8a1287b5453e8163747999491cec8a273e5485d,a8a1287b5453e8163747999491cec8a273e5485d,"Edem Fiatsonu, Aniruddha Deka, M.

The Pampa del Indio project: District-wide quasi-elimination of Triatoma infestans after a 9-year intervention program in the Argentine Chaco,"Background The elimination of Triatoma infestans, the main domestic vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, is lagging behind expectations in the Gran Chaco region. We implemented an insecticide-based intervention program and assessed its long-term effects on house infestation and bug abundance in a resource-constrained municipality (Pampa del Indio, northeastern Argentina) inhabited by creole and the Qom indigenous people (2007–2016). Key questions were whether district-wide data integration revealed patterns concealed at lower spatial levels; to what extent preintervention infestation and pyrethroid resistance challenged the effectiveness of insecticide-based control efforts, and how much control effort was needed to meet defined targets. Methods Supervised vector control teams i) georeferenced every housing unit at baseline (1,546); ii) evaluated house infestation using timed-manual searches with a dislodging aerosol across four rural areas designated for district-wide scaling up; iii) sprayed with pyrethroid insecticide 92.7% of all houses; iv) periodically monitored infestation and promoted householder-based surveillance, and v) selectively sprayed the infested houses, totaling 1,823 insecticide treatments throughout the program. Results Baseline house infestation (mean, 26.8%; range, 14.4–41.4%) and bug abundance plummeted over the first year postintervention (YPI). Timed searches at baseline detected 61.4–88.0% of apparent infestations revealed by any of the methods used. Housing dynamics varied widely among areas and between Qom and creole households. Preintervention triatomine abundance and the cumulative frequency of insecticide treatments were spatially aggregated in three large clusters overlapping with pyrethroid resistance, which ranged from susceptible to high. Persistent foci were suppressed with malathion. Aggregation occurred mainly at house compound or village levels. Preintervention domestic infestation and abundance were much greater in Qom than in creole households, whereas the reverse was recorded in peridomestic habitats. House infestation, rare (1.9–3.7%) over 2–6 YPI, averaged 0.66% (95% confidence interval, 0.28–1.29%) at endpoint. Conclusions Upscale integration revealed multiple coupled heterogeneities (spatial, sociodemographic and biological) that reflect large inequalities, hamper control efforts, and provide opportunities for targeted, sustainable disease control. High-coverage, professional insecticide spraying combined with systematic surveillance-and-response were essential ingredients to achieve the quasi-elimination of T. infestans within 5 YPI and concomitant transmission blockage despite various structural threats and constraints.",2023,8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f1756a3853914836d371bb7c72579c0069f14744,f1756a3853914836d371bb7c72579c0069f14744,"R.

"Climate and Environmental Changes and Their Potential Effects on the Dynamics of Chagas Disease: Hybridization in Rhodniini (Hemiptera, Triatominae)","Simple Summary All 155 living species of triatomines are considered to be potential vectors of Chagas disease. Laboratory and field studies demonstrate that these insects are capable of crossing and producing hybrids. Hybrids of Triatoma spp. have a greater capacity and vectorial competence to acquire and transmit Trypanosoma cruzi than the parental species. Therefore, we conducted studies to assess whether the Rhodnius spp. and Psammolestes spp. that live in sympatry (if found in natural conditions) or allopatry (geographically isolated) are capable of producing hybrids. We observed that all cross species produce hybrid offspring in at least one direction. Although the vectorial capacity and competence of these insect vectors must be evaluated, we emphasize the importance of directing the monitoring activities of vector control programs toward possible natural hybridization events in the face of climatic and environmental changes. Abstract Chagas disease affects about eight million people. In view of the issues related to the influence of anthropogenic changes in the dynamics of the distribution and reproductive interaction of triatomines, we performed experimental crosses between species of the Rhodniini tribe in order to evaluate interspecific reproductive interactions and hybrid production capacity. Reciprocal crossing experiments were conducted among Rhodnius brethesi × R. pictipes, R. colombiensis × R. ecuadoriensis, R. neivai × R. prolixus, R. robustus × R. prolixus, R. montenegrensis × R. marabaensis; R. montenegrensis × R. robustus, R. prolixus × R. nasutus and R. neglectus × R. milesi. With the exception of crosses between R. pictipes ♀ × R. brethesi ♂, R. ecuadoriensis ♀ × R. colombiensis ♂ and R. prolixus ♀ × R. neivai ♂, all experimental crosses resulted in hybrids. Our results demonstrate that both allopatric and sympatric species produce hybrids, which can generate concern for public health agencies in the face of current anthropogenic events. Thus, we demonstrate that species of the Rhodniini tribe are capable of producing hybrids under laboratory conditions. These results are of great epidemiological importance and raise an important discussion about the influence of climatic and environmental interactions on Chagas disease dynamics.",2023,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c76aea5538905bef23fa8be09d1804db6a4330d7,c76aea5538905bef23fa8be09d1804db6a4330d7,"Amanda Ravazi, J.

Gene editing in the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius prolixus by Cas9-mediated ReMOT Control,"Rhodnius prolixus is currently the model vector of choice for studying Chagas disease transmission, a debilitating disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasites. Despite the broad use of double-stranded RNA interference for the knockdown of gene function in R. prolixus, transgenesis and gene editing protocols are still lacking. Here we tested Receptor-Mediated Ovary Transduction of Cargo (ReMOT Control) and direct parental injection of CRISPR (DIPA-CRISPR) for the maternal delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 elements to developing R. prolixus oocytes, and strategies for the identification of insertions/deletions (indels) in target loci of resulting gene-edited G0 nymphs. We demonstrate successful ReMOT Control-mediated gene editing of the eye color markers Rp-scarlet and Rp-white, and the cuticle color marker Rp-yellow, with highest effectiveness obtained using the ovary-targeting BtKV ligand. These results provide proof-of-concepts for generating somatic mutations in R. prolixus and potentially for generating germline edited lines in triatomines. Our studies also suggest that optimal strategies for recovery of mutations include performing multiple gRNA injections and the use of visible phenotypes such as those displayed in the Rp-scarlet, Rp-white and Rp-yellow loci for future Co-CRISPR experiments. These results will lay the foundation for gene editing protocols for triatomines and could lead to the development of novel control strategies for vectors of Chagas disease. Author Summary Rhodnius prolixus is an insect vector of the protozoan Trypanossoma cruzi, causative agent of debilitating Chagas disease. To fight the spread of the disease, it has been suggested that biological control of the insect should be attempted. Gene editing by the novel CRISPR methodology holds great promise in this sense, as it enables to target almost any gene in the genome for mutagenesis, thus allowing the control of insect physiology and reproduction. Here we have tested protocols for the delivery of CRISPR reagents as an attempt to enable genome editing of the vector. Our results show that maternal delivery of CRISPR by the ReMOT Control method is efficient for mutating eye and cuticle color genes in the resulting nymphs, generating edited animals with red eyes, white eyes or a yellow cuticle. This is the first report of gene editing in a vector of Chagas disease and should lay the basis to produce modified animals either unable to carry the T. cruzi parasite or to reproduce.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4394bf11be7035c3fc34444bf5248846952cf59e,4394bf11be7035c3fc34444bf5248846952cf59e,"Leonardo Lima, M.

"Socio‐environmental factors associated with the occurrence of triatomines (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in an endemic municipality in northern Minas Gerais, Brazil","Triatomines are the vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. The study aimed to evaluate the association between sociodemographic and environmental factors, and changes in land use and cover, with the occurrence and abundance of triatomines by census sectors in an endemic municipality of northern Minas Gerais, Brazil. The study was conducted in Montes Claros, located in the north of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The entomological data used in the study were collected by active surveillance in the rural area from 2015 to 2019 and by passive surveillance in the urban area from 2009 to 2019. Data on sociodemographic and environmental factors and changes in land use and land cover were obtained from the urban and rural census sectors. A total of 1404 triatomines, belonging to eight species, were captured in domiciles in the rural area (2015–2019) and 277 triatomines in domiciles in the urban area (2009–2019) of the municipality of Montes Claros. The variables the number of domiciles, household economic income, pavement, NDVI, deforestation, unchanged, and anthropic proved to be positively associated with the occurrence and/or number of triatomines in census sectors, within the models. The occurrence of triatomines in the domestic environment of the municipality of Montes Claros should be considered a public health problem, as it suggests a potential risk of establishment and transmission of T. cruzi to domestic animals, farm animals, and humans.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05ddf5b8bc5aabd89be1d6ed60c492eb923e3516,05ddf5b8bc5aabd89be1d6ed60c492eb923e3516,"Thainara da Silva Gonçalves, R.

Microbiomes of Blood-Feeding Triatomines in the Context of Their Predatory Relatives and the Environment,"This study places microbiomes of blood-feeding North American Triatoma vectors (Reduviidae) into a broader evolutionary and ecological context provided by related predatory assassin bugs (Reduviidae), another unrelated vector species (soft tick Ornithodoros turicata), and the environment these arthropods coinhabit. For both vectors, microbiome analyses suggest three interrelated sources of bacteria, i.e., the microbiome of vertebrate nests as their natural habitat, the vertebrate skin microbiome, and the pathobiome circulating in vertebrate blood. ABSTRACT The importance of gut microbiomes has become generally recognized in vector biology. This study addresses microbiome signatures in North American Triatoma species of public health significance (vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi) linked to their blood-feeding strategy and the natural habitat. To place the Triatoma-associated microbiomes within a complex evolutionary and ecological context, we sampled sympatric Triatoma populations, related predatory reduviids, unrelated ticks, and environmental material from vertebrate nests where these arthropods reside. Along with five Triatoma species, we have characterized microbiomes of five reduviids (Stenolemoides arizonensis, Ploiaria hirticornis, Zelus longipes, and two Reduvius species), a single soft tick species, Ornithodoros turicata, and environmental microbiomes from selected sites in Arizona, Texas, Florida, and Georgia. The microbiomes of predatory reduviids lack a shared core microbiota. As in triatomines, microbiome dissimilarities among species correlate with dominance of a single bacterial taxon. These include Rickettsia, Lactobacillus, “Candidatus Midichloria,” and Zymobacter, which are often accompanied by known symbiotic genera, i.e., Wolbachia, “Candidatus Lariskella,” Asaia, Gilliamella, and Burkholderia. We have further identified a compositional convergence of the analyzed microbiomes in regard to the host phylogenetic distance in both blood-feeding and predatory reduviids. While the microbiomes of the two reduviid species from the Emesinae family reflect their close relationship, the microbiomes of all Triatoma species repeatedly form a distinct monophyletic cluster highlighting their phylosymbiosis. Furthermore, based on environmental microbiome profiles and blood meal analysis, we propose three epidemiologically relevant and mutually interrelated bacterial sources for Triatoma microbiomes, i.e., host abiotic environment, host skin microbiome, and pathogens circulating in host blood. IMPORTANCE This study places microbiomes of blood-feeding North American Triatoma vectors (Reduviidae) into a broader evolutionary and ecological context provided by related predatory assassin bugs (Reduviidae), another unrelated vector species (soft tick Ornithodoros turicata), and the environment these arthropods coinhabit. For both vectors, microbiome analyses suggest three interrelated sources of bacteria, i.e., the microbiome of vertebrate nests as their natural habitat, the vertebrate skin microbiome, and the pathobiome circulating in vertebrate blood. Despite an apparent influx of environment-associated bacteria into the arthropod microbiomes, Triatoma microbiomes retain their specificity, forming a distinct cluster that significantly differs from both predatory relatives and ecologically comparable ticks. Similarly, within the related predatory Reduviidae, we found the host phylogenetic distance to underlie microbiome similarities.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e33bd43f2cb35384dc6064abf2a73bf40c2a28e,0e33bd43f2cb35384dc6064abf2a73bf40c2a28e,"Hassan Tarabai, A.

Characterization of External Female Genitalia in Five Triatoma Laporte Species of South America (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae),"Currently, there are 158 valid species of triatomines, all of which are potential vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. The correct taxonomic identification of triatomines is essential since each species hos a different epidemiological importance. The aim of the study is to compare five species of South American Triatoma. Here we present a comparative study of terminal abdominal segments in females by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the species Triatoma delpontei, T. jurbergi, T. infestans var. melanosoma, T. platensis, and T. vandae. The results showed diagnostic characters for the studied species. The dorsal view featured more valuable characters, with seven informative characters. Similarities were observed among T. delpontei, T. infestans var. melanosoma, and T. platensis, and between T. jurbergi and T. vandae, correlating with previous studies. Thus, female genital characters proved to be reliable and useful in the diagnosis of the Triatoma species studied here; additional studies, along with other sets of behavioral, morphological, and molecular data, helped to reinforce the hypotheses found here.",2023,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f48c897f9578984e63a1200326c32cb210148cfd,f48c897f9578984e63a1200326c32cb210148cfd,"João Paulo Sales Oliveira-Correia, H.

"Epidemiological indicators of Chagas disease in the metropolitan region of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil","ABSTRACT Background: Chagas disease (CD) is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by triatomines. Historical information from the 20th century demonstrates T. cruzi records in the metropolitan region of Salvador (MRS), the third largest urban agglomeration in the Brazilian Northeast and the eighth largest in Brazil, an area with intense migratory activity from CD-endemic regions. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate CD indicators (prevalence and mortality) in the MRS. Methods: A mixed ecological and descriptive study was conducted using secondary data. We analyzed data from 2008 to 2015: deaths due to CD, self-reported cases of CD, and blood donors that were non-negative for T. cruzi infection. Results: São Francisco do Conde was one of the municipalities with the highest mortality rates due to CD. The seroprevalence rates varied by year and municipality; those with the highest values were 2008: Vera Cruz, 2009: Mata de São João, 2010: Dias D'Ávila, 2011 and 2015: São Francisco do Conde, 2012: São Sebastião do Passé, and 2013 and 2014: Pojuca. Spatial correlations between the municipalities were not detected. Conclusions: We conclude that CD is present in the MRS. The indicators analyzed in the MRS are below-state-level data. Given the importance of indicator analysis for the surveillance and control of CD at the state and national levels, it is important to strengthen the surveillance program at the municipal level, including the regions classified as low risk for T. cruzi vector transmission.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4daccddeee8e944b69f7533afda899a9256a2a68,4daccddeee8e944b69f7533afda899a9256a2a68,"F.

Cytogenetic Key to Identification of Triatominae Species Reported in an Outbreak Region of Oral Transmission of Chagas Disease in the Brazilian Northeast.,"Oral transmission from the consumption of processed food with triatomines and/or their feces infected with Trypanosoma cruzi prevails among recent cases of Chagas disease in Brazil. In Paraíba, a state of the Brazilian northeast, there was an outbreak caused by the consumption of sugarcane juice that resulted in 26 cases of infection and one death. Until now, 10 species of triatomines have been reported in this Brazilian state. Thus, we developed a dichotomous key to assist in the correct identification of Paraíba triatomines based on cytogenetic data. The dichotomous key allowed the differentiation of all the species in this state. Although the purpose of CytoKeys is not to replace dichotomous keys based on morphological data, the use of these complementary keys can help to solve taxonomic problems, preventing identification errors, especially between similar species such as Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma petrocchiae, both present in the Brazilian northeast.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f6e27e97ec219f862139a9305fcf7e1b92a85d2,2f6e27e97ec219f862139a9305fcf7e1b92a85d2,"Emercio Felisberto Nhapulo, Denis Vinícius de Mello, Laura Poloto Cesaretto, Julia Junqueira Alevi, D.

Development and survival of Triatoma barberi and Triatoma longipennis (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) is affected by Trypanosoma cruzi colonization,"Triatomines are insect vectors of the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This occurs when the triatomine defecates on the skin of the vertebrate host when it bites its host for feeding. This lesion causes the penetration of T. cruzi, whose infective phase is the tripomastigote, and the non-infective replicative phase epimastigote. Although the effects of T. cruzi on the development and survival of different species of triatomine bugs are known, it has not been fully described how the parasite affects many of the species that inhabit Mexico. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of the presence of T. cruzi on triatomine development and survival. For this, five triatomines of each instar of each species, Triatoma barberi and Triatoma longipennis, were inoculated, from their second instar to their adult stage, female or male. Each triatomine was infected with 3-5 x105 parasites and they were incubated for 100 days and the kinetic of parasites in the feces and T. cruzi phases were recorded. The results showed that T. barberi and T. longipennis development was affected in all stages because of T. cruzi infection. It was greater for T. longipennis, both in its mortality, as well as time to molt in each phase.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4737194bacbbac08f5fa33cac2270f118caf1583,4737194bacbbac08f5fa33cac2270f118caf1583,"M.

Genetic Diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in the United States of America: The Least Endemic Country for Chagas Disease,"Chagas disease (CD), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and endemic in Latin America, has become an emergent health problem in non-endemic countries due to human migration. The United States (US) is the non-Latin American country with the highest CD burden and cannot be considered as non-endemic, since triatomine vectors and reservoir animals have been found. Populations of T. cruzi are divided into genetic subdivisions, which are known as discrete typing units (DTUs): TcI to TcVI and TcBat. Autochthonous human T. cruzi infection in the US is sporadic, but it may change due to environmental factors affecting the geographic distribution of triatomines. We aimed to perform a literature review of the genetic diversity of T. cruzi in triatomine vectors and mammalian hosts, including human cases, in the US. The 34 analyzed studies revealed the presence of T. cruzi in 18 states, which was mainly concentrated in Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. TcI and TcIV were the principal DTUs identified, being TcI the most genotyped (42.4%; 917/2164). This study represents a first attempt to compile the molecular epidemiology of T. cruzi in the US, which is fundamental for predicting the progression of the infection in the country and could be of great help in its future management.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db8eb16c17632cde118446a8a08b9e98bbcd87c6,db8eb16c17632cde118446a8a08b9e98bbcd87c6,"Arnau Llovera, Alba Abras, A.

Life history data of four populations of Triatoma mexicana (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) from Central Mexico.,"Triatomine bugs are vectors for the Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas parasites, the etiological agent for Chagas disease. This study evaluated 6 epidemiologically significant behaviors (development time, number of blood meals required for molting to the next instar, mortality rate, aggressiveness, feeding duration, and defecation delay) across 4 populations of Triatoma mexicana Herrich-Schaeffer (Heteroptera: Reduviidae), a major T. cruzi vector in Central Mexico. We collected triatomines from areas characterized by high (HP), medium (MP), medium-high (MHP), and low (LP) prevalence of human T. cruzi infection. The MHP population had the shortest development time, <290 days. Both the HP and MP populations required the most blood meals to molt to the next instar, with a median of 13. Mortality rates varied across all populations, ranging from 44% to 52%. All of the tested populations showed aggressive behavior during feeding. All populations shared similar feeding durations, with most exceeding 13 min and increasing with each instar. Quick defecation, during feeding, immediately after or less than 1 min after feeding, was observed in most nymphs (78%-90%) from the MP and MHP populations and adults (74%-92%) from HP, MP, and MHP populations. Though most parameters suggest a low potential for T. mexicana to transmit T. cruzi, unique feeding and defecation behaviors in 3 populations (excluding the LP group) could elevate their epidemiological importance. These population-specific differences may contribute to the varying prevalence rates of T. cruzi infection in areas where T. mexicana is found.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77207a5daa25ea5d819c25818bea9adefa1a5619,77207a5daa25ea5d819c25818bea9adefa1a5619,"B.

"Life history data of a Triatoma protracta nahuatlae, T. sinaloensis, and their laboratory hybrids (Hemiptera: Reduviidae)","Chagas disease is one of the most significant vector-borne diseases in Mexico. The presence of “sylvatic” triatomine vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas) inside human dwellings necessitates estimating their vectorial capacity. To estimate this capacity in Triatoma protracta nahuatlae (Ryckman), Triatoma sinaloensis (Ryckman), and their laboratory hybrids, 6 biological parameters were examined. Triatoma sinaloensis exhibited the shortest development time (155 days), with a median of 12 blood meals. Mortality rates varied from 35% to 45% in the 3 studied cohorts. All 3 cohorts were aggressive, initiating feeding within 0.5–1 min, and had similar feeding periods ranging from 10 to 18 min. A majority (75.3–97.9%) of the hybrids defecated when feeding, immediately after feeding, or in less than 1 min post-feeding. In contrast, only 7–42% of nymphs of T. sinaloensis defecated during the same period. Our results regarding the 6 parameters studied confirm the potential role of T. p. nahuatlae as an efficient vector of T. cruzi. Triatoma sinaloensis, on the other hand, exhibited limited vectorial capacity primarily due to its poor defecation behavior. Continued surveillance of these “sylvatic” triatomine populations is necessary to prevent an epidemiological problem.

"Prevalence and Diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in Triatomine Vectors and Their Blood Meal Sources from South Central Texas, USA","Simple Summary Chagas disease is endemic to the state of Texas in the United States but does not have consistent surveillance or reporting. We utilized multiple sampling sites and different species of triatomine to gain data on the blood meal sources found by DNA testing for the host and vector species identities. From domestic, peridomestic, and rural sites, we found a breadth of blood meal origins including mammals, chickens, and reptiles. Unique non-native taxa utilized for blood meals enabled us to also report on extensive foraging distances for the vectors. Understanding the diversity of blood meal sources and the distances the vectors travel between meals and daytime refuges are both important aspects for understanding the spread of this disease. Abstract The prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi was assessed in 117 triatomine insects from central Texas. The qPCR-based results revealed T. cruzi in 59% of the insects (62 adults and eight nymphs), with overall prevalences of T. cruzi of 0% (0/9), 64% (11/17), 58% (10/17), 73% (30/41), and 57% (19/33) for the Bastrop, Caldwell, Gonzales, Guadalupe, and Hays counties, respectively. Analyses of 18S rRNA fragments confirmed T. cuzi in 81% of these samples. Vectors were identified as Triatoma gerstaeckeri (35% of which 65% were positive for T. cruzi), T. sanguisuga (21%, 43% positive), and Paratriatoma leticularia (0.3%, 100% positive). Food sources were recovered from 29% of the insects. Raccoons were 53% of the blood meals (83% positive for T. cruzi), while the remainder came from a variety of sources, including humans (33% positive), house geckos, Eastern woodrats, plain-bellied water snakes (50% positive), hispid cotton rats (0% positive), chickens (100% positive); Asian forest turtles, bison, and pigs (0% positive). The serendipitous detection of blood meal sources at known minimum distances from the collection of the vector insect enabled us to provide several instances where the insect foraging distance was greater than 400 m. These vector foraging distances are novel information that can assist in our understanding of the landscape dynamics for the spread of the pathogen.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2576777420e5679266daee09fb131ac109752017,2576777420e5679266daee09fb131ac109752017,"Rebecca J.

Domestic Dog Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi from Northern and Southern Regions of Mexico.,"Background: Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and vectored by triatomines, affects millions of people worldwide. In endemic countries including Mexico, infections in domestic animals, such as dogs, may affect the risk of human disease when they serve as a source of infection to vectors that subsequently infect humans. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 296 dogs from two cities near the northern and southern borders of Mexico: Reynosa, Tamaulipas, and Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas. Infection was measured based on testing of blood using T. cruzi quantitative PCR (qPCR) and up to three antibody detection assays. The StatPak immunochromatographic assay was used to screen samples and the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) and multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MIA) tests were used as secondary tests on all samples that screened positive and a subset of negatives. Serologic positivity was defined based on reactivity on at least two independent tests. Results: Of the 280 samples tested for parasite DNA, two (0.7%) were positive, one of which (0.4%) was confirmed as T. cruzi discrete typing unit TcIV. Overall, 72 (24.3%) samples were reactive for T. cruzi antibodies via StatPak of which 8 were also positive using MIA and 2 were also positive using IFA (including one of the PCR-positive dogs). Overall, nine dogs (3.4%) met study criteria of positivity based on either/both serology or PCR tests. Positive dogs were found in both regions of Mexico; five (2.7%) from Reynosa and four (3.6%) from Tuxtla Gutierrez. We found no association between infection status and state of origin, sex, age group, breed group, neighborhood, and whether other pets lived in the home. Conclusion: Our results re-emphasize dogs' utility as sentinels for T. cruzi in Mexico and underscore the need for improved veterinary diagnostic tests and parasite surveillance at the household level in endemic countries.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9391f15fa5412f93ff430c0260f769620f0a630,e9391f15fa5412f93ff430c0260f769620f0a630,"Edward Davila, Nadia A Fernandez-Santos, J.

Lessons to be popular: the chemical basis of aggregation in Trypanosoma cruzi-infected and non-infected Chagasic bugs,"Aggregation is one of the most remarkable behaviours in the animal kingdom—a process that is usually governed by pheromones. Triatomines are blood-sucking bugs that act as vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease in mammals, including humans. Triatomines usually gather in roosting refuges by using aggregation pheromones of unknown chemical structure. In terms of vector control, one option to reduce triatomine–human contact is via capturing the insects into traps baited with lures based on such aggregation pheromones. As a first step towards this aim, we elucidated the aggregation pheromone in the triatomine Triatoma pallidipennis, using T. cruzi-infected and non-infected bugs. We used different extraction techniques and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry for the identification. Also, two different bioassays were implemented for evaluating the attractant and arrestant activity of the pheromone. We found that T. pallidipennis produced short-chain aldehydes as attractants, and nitrogen-derived compounds as arrestants. We detected differences in the production and perception of these compounds according to whether animals were infected or not. These findings show that T. cruzi may influence triatomine chemical ecology and are promising tools for triatomine control.",2024,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/391f1a73a43420d2bcdd6fc71fddcb96f4032bf8,391f1a73a43420d2bcdd6fc71fddcb96f4032bf8,"D.

Detection and Genotyping of Trypanosoma cruzi Samples in Species of Genus Rhodnius from Different Environments in the Brazilian Amazon.,"Background: In the Amazon region, several species of triatomines occur in the natural environments. Among them, species of the genus Rhodnius are a risk to human populations due to their high rates of infection with Trypanosoma cruzi. The aim of this study was to identify the T. cruzi genotypes in Rhodnius specimens and their relationship with sylvatic hosts from different environments in the Brazilian Amazon. Methods: A total of 492 triatomines were collected from the municipalities of Monte Negro, Rondônia state, and Humaitá, Amazonas state, 382 of them being nymphs and 110 adults. Genotyping of T. cruzi in six discrete typing units (DTUs) was performed using conventional multilocus PCR. The triatomines that were positive for T. cruzi and engorged with blood were also targeted for amplification of the cytochrome B (cytB) gene to identify bloodmeal sources. Results: Of the 162 positive samples, the identified DTUs were TcI (87.65%) and TcIV (12.35%). It was observed that 102 specimens were engorged with a variety of bloodmeals. Triatomines infected with TcI were associated with DNA of all identified vertebrates, except Plecturocebus brunneus. TcIV was detected in triatomines that fed on Coendou prehensilis, Didelphis marsupialis, Mabuya nigropunctata, P. brunneus, Pithecia irrorata, Sapajus apella, and Tamandua tetradactyla. Conclusion: Results highlight the need to understand the patterns of T. cruzi genotypes in Rhodnius spp. and their association with sylvatic hosts to better elucidate their role in the transmission of Chagas disease in the Amazon region.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/376667c8789747325e7241fe7b2a4e7d9777bcb1,376667c8789747325e7241fe7b2a4e7d9777bcb1,"Adriana Benatti Bilheiro, G.

First Report of Chagas Disease Vector Species Triatoma sanguisuga (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) Infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in Delaware,"ABSTRACT. In July and October 2023, two live triatomine bugs were found inside a home in New Castle County, Delaware. The bugs were identified as Triatoma sanguisuga, the most widespread triatomine bug species in the United States. Triatoma sanguisuga is a competent vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The two specimens were tested via real-time PCR (qPCR) for infection with T. cruzi, and one of the specimens was positive. Despite T. sanguisuga being endemic to the area, attainment of accurate species identification and T. cruzi testing of the bugs required multiple calls to federal, state, private, and academic institutions over several months. This constitutes the first report of T. sanguisuga infected with T. cruzi in Delaware. In addition, this is the first published report of T. sanguisuga in New Castle County, the northernmost and most densely populated county in Delaware. New Castle County still conforms to the described geographic range of T. sanguisuga, which spans from Texas to the East Coast of the United States. The T. cruzi infection prevalence of the species has not been studied in the northeastern United States, but collections in southern states have found prevalences as high as 60%. The Delaware homeowner’s lengthy pursuit of accurate information about the vector highlights the need for more research on this important disease vector in Delaware.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6eea8f8e7462f73401ae4afe11fbdc70e0d80d87,6eea8f8e7462f73401ae4afe11fbdc70e0d80d87,"Jennifer K.

"Transmission ecology of Trypanosoma cruzi by Rhodnius prolixus (Reduviidae: Triatominae) infesting palm-tree species in the Colombian Orinoco, indicates risks to human populations","Background Chagas disease, affecting approximately eight million individuals in tropical regions, is primarily transmitted by vectors. Rhodnius prolixus, a triatomine vector, commonly inhabits in ecotopes with diverse palm tree species, creating optimal conditions for vector proliferation. This study aims to explore the transmission ecology of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative parasite of Chagas disease, by investigating the feeding patterns and natural infection rates of R. prolixus specimens collected from various wild palm species in the Colombian Orinoco region. Materials and methods To achieve this objective, we sampled 35 individuals from three palm species (Attalea butyracea, Acrocomia aculeata, and Mauritia flexuosa) in a riparian forest in the Casanare department of eastern Colombia, totaling 105 sampled palm trees. DNA was extracted and analyzed from 115 R. prolixus specimens at different developmental stages using quantitative PCR (qPCR) for T. cruzi detection and identification of discrete typing units. Feeding preferences were determined by sequencing the 12S rRNA gene amplicon through next-generation sequencing. Results A total of 676 R. prolixus specimens were collected from the sampled palms. The study revealed variation in population densities and developmental stages of R. prolixus among palm tree species, with higher densities observed in A. butyracea and lower densities in M. flexuosa. TcI was the exclusive T. cruzi discrete typing unit (DTU) found, with infection frequency positively correlated with R. prolixus abundance. Insects captured in A. butyracea exhibited higher abundance and infection rates than those from other palm species. The feeding sources comprised 13 mammal species, showing no significant differences between palm species in terms of blood sources. However, Didelphis marsupialis and Homo sapiens were present in all examined R. prolixus, and Dasypus novemcinctus was found in 89.47% of the insects. Conclusion This study highlights the significance of wild palms, particularly A. butyracea, as a substantial risk factor for T. cruzi transmission to humans in these environments. High population densities and infection rates of R. prolixus were observed in each examined palm tree species.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ffadaa5a8528db85bf27509684c6b4d125aa0055,ffadaa5a8528db85bf27509684c6b4d125aa0055,"P.

Branched chain amino acids modulate the proteomic profile of Pro-induced differentiation for the infective stages of Trypanosoma cruzi,"Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, undergoes a complex life cycle involving triatomine insects as vectors and mammals. The differentiation of epimastigote forms into metacyclic trypomastigotes within the insect vector is crucial for the parasite’s life cycle progression. Factors influencing this process, including temperature, pH, and nutritional stress, along with specific metabolite availability, play a pivotal role. Amino acids like Pro, His, and Gln support cell differentiation, while branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) inhibit it. Interestingly, combining the pro-metacyclogenic amino acid Pro with one of the anti-metacyclogenic BCAAs results in viable metacyclics with significantly reduced infectivity. To explore the characteristics of metacyclic parasites differentiated in the presence of BCAAs, proteomics analyses were conducted. Metacyclics obtained in triatomine artificial urine (TAU) supplemented with Pro alone and in combination with Leu, Ile, or Val were compared. The analyses revealed differential regulation of 40 proteins in TAU-Pro-Leu, 131 in TAU-Pro-Ile, and 179 in TAU-Pro-Val, as compared to metacyclics from TAU-Pro. Among these, 22%, 11%, and 13% of the proteins were associated with metabolic processes, respectively. Notably, enzymes related to glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were reduced in metacyclics with Pro-BCAAs, while enzymes involved in amino acid and purine metabolic pathways were increased. Furthermore, metacyclics with Pro-Ile and Pro-Val exhibited elevated enzymes linked to lipid and redox metabolism. These findings suggest that the presence of BCAAs can reshape the metabolism of metacyclics, contributing to the observed reduction in infectivity in these parasites.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c884e97bd2dc1420146f0adcdb89f1bda935a7e7,c884e97bd2dc1420146f0adcdb89f1bda935a7e7,"Janaina de Freitas Nascimento, F.

First Report of Seropositivity to Trypanosoma cruzi in Mexican Afro-Descendants from Guerrero and Oaxaca States,"Mexican Afro-descendant is a population poorly studied in many aspects, between them the infectious diseases that they suffer. This population is mainly found in the country's Pacific (Oaxaca and Guerrero states) and Atlantic (Veracruz) coast. In these regions, a diversity of triatomine vectors of the Chagas disease is found. Also, all the genotypes of Trypanosoma cruzi DTUs have been reported. That is why the present study aimed to study the presence of antibodies against T. cruzi and cardiac pathology associated with the Chagas disease in the Mexican Afro-descendant population of Guerrero and Oaxaca. ELISA, Western blot, and recombinant antigen's ELISA were used to evaluate the seropositivity of these communities. Furthermore, an electrocardiographic study and evaluation of risk factors associated with T. cruzi infection in the Oaxaca and Guerrero populations were conducted. 26.77% of the analyzed population was positive for two serological tests. These percentages are higher than the previously reported for the mestizo population in similar studies.

The importance of estimating the burden of disease from foodborne transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi,"Chagas disease (ChD), caused by infection with the flagellated protozoan, Trypanosoma cruzi, has a complicated transmission cycle with many infection routes. These include vector-borne (via the triatomine (reduviid bug) vector defecating into a skin abrasion, usually following a blood meal), transplacental transmission, blood transfusion, organ transplant, laboratory accident, and foodborne transmission. Foodborne transmission may occur due to ingestion of meat or blood from infected animals or from ingestion of other foods (often fruit juice) contaminated by infected vectors or secretions from reservoir hosts. Despite the high disease burden associated with ChD, it was omitted from the original World Health Organization estimates of foodborne disease burden that were published in 2015. As these estimates are currently being updated, this review presents arguments for including ChD in new estimates of the global burden of foodborne disease. Preliminary calculations suggest a burden of at least 137,000 Disability Adjusted Life Years, but this does not take into account the greater symptom severity associated with foodborne transmission. Thus, we also provide information regarding the greater health burden in endemic areas associated with foodborne infection compared with vector-borne infection, with higher mortality and more severe symptoms. We therefore suggest that it is insufficient to use source attribution alone to determine the foodborne proportion of current burden estimates, as this may underestimate the higher disability and mortality associated with the foodborne infection route.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c35ae6fb2950d7e80fdcd99249b8db4fd0a982ad,c35ae6fb2950d7e80fdcd99249b8db4fd0a982ad,"Lucy J.

The risk of vector transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi remains high in the State of Paraná,"BACKGROUND Monitoring and analysing the infection rates of the vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, that causes Chagas disease, helps assess the risk of transmission. OBJECTIVES A study was carried out on triatomine in the State of Paraná, Brazil, between 2012 and 2021 and a comparison was made with a previous study. This was done to assess the risk of disease transmission. METHODS Ecological niche models based on climate and landscape variables were developed to predict habitat suitability for the vectors as a proxy for risk of occurrence. FINDINGS A total of 1,750 specimens of triatomines were recorded, of which six species were identified. The overall infection rate was 22.7%. The areas with the highest risk transmission of T. cruzi are consistent with previous predictions in municipalities. New data shows that climate models are more accurate than landscape models. This is likely because climate suitability was higher in the previous period. MAIN CONCLUSION Regardless of uneven sampling and potential biases, risk remains high due to the wide presence of infected vectors and high environmental suitability for vector species throughout the state and, therefore, improvements in public policies aimed at wide dissemination of knowledge about the disease are recommended to ensure the State remains free of Chagas disease.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae4cb9459916c9b49f0555b8b9852b4ea8c01756,ae4cb9459916c9b49f0555b8b9852b4ea8c01756,"J.

Clonagem e caracterização do gene que codifica a proteína de choque térmico HSP83 do Trypanosoma cruzi,"[Objective] Trypanosoma cruzi, a causal agent of Chagas’ disease, is a parasite whose life cycle alternates between an invertebrate (triatomine) and a vertebrate (mammal) host. Various studies have shown that in T. cruzi, HSP83 (a homolog of HSP90) is essential for cell division and control of the response to thermal stress. This investigation focused on studying the cloning, bioinformatic characterization, and expression of the heat shock protein HSP83 T. cruzi gene for further cell signaling studies. [Methodology] RNA was extracted from T. cruzi epimastigotes (EPm6 clone, MHOM/VE/2007/ 6c) using a commercial kit. The cDNA encoding HSP83 was determined using RT-PCR on extracted mRNA, for which the primers were designed based on the HSP83 sequence of T. cruzi strain CL Brener. Cloning was performed using pGEM®T-Easy and subcloned into the expression vector pQE30. Sequence and bioinformatic characterization were performed. The gene was expressed, and the recombinant protein was purified using affinity chromatography and identified through immunoblotting. [Results] Sequence analysis showed similarity to the gene encoding HSP83 from Trypanosoma cruzi, and HSP domains and B epitopes in the sequence were also observed. After 3 hours of induction with IPTG, a recombinant protein with an approximate weight of 83 kDa was obtained. The immunoblotting reaction with hyperimmune anti-T. cruzi epimastigote serum helped detect a single band with a molecular weight of nearly 83 kDa. [Conclusions] All results indicate that the cloning and characterization of HSP83 from Trypanosoma cruzi was achieved.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/71a3115e96d616e745f5e3a88b68d1df2e20253e,71a3115e96d616e745f5e3a88b68d1df2e20253e,"Ana Fernández, Ana Rita De Lima, Elizabeth Ferrer"
"Interaction of Trypanosoma cruzi, Triatomines and the Microbiota of the Vectors—A Review","This review summarizes the interactions between Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, its vectors, triatomines, and the diverse intestinal microbiota of triatomines, which includes mutualistic symbionts, and highlights open questions. T. cruzi strains show great biological heterogeneity in their development and their interactions. Triatomines differ from other important vectors of diseases in their ontogeny and the enzymes used to digest blood. Many different bacteria colonize the intestinal tract of triatomines, but only Actinomycetales have been identified as mutualistic symbionts. Effects of the vector on T. cruzi are indicated by differences in the ability of T. cruzi to establish in the triatomines and in colonization peculiarities, i.e., proliferation mainly in the posterior midgut and rectum and preferential transformation into infectious metacyclic trypomastigotes in the rectum. In addition, certain forms of T. cruzi develop after feeding and during starvation of triatomines. Negative effects of T. cruzi on the triatomine vectors appear to be particularly evident when the triatomines are stressed and depend on the T. cruzi strain. Effects on the intestinal immunity of the triatomines are induced by ingested blood-stage trypomastigotes of T. cruzi and affect the populations of many non-symbiotic intestinal bacteria, but not all and not the mutualistic symbionts. After the knockdown of antimicrobial peptides, the number of non-symbiotic bacteria increases and the number of T. cruzi decreases. Presumably, in long-term infections, intestinal immunity is suppressed, which supports the growth of specific bacteria, depending on the strain of T. cruzi. These interactions may provide an approach to disrupt T. cruzi transmission.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/787e033f1c98eb3e324b62bfd4b68c30674885d4,787e033f1c98eb3e324b62bfd4b68c30674885d4,
"Infection by Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas, 1909) in a colony of Triatoma sherlocki Papa et al. 2002 (Reduviidae: Triatominae) present in a subsistence pig farm in Northeast Brazil.","Triatomines of the species Triatoma sherlocki are considered sylvatic; however, household invasion appears imminent, potentially carrying Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease.

Triatomines collected underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for T. cruzi detection and determination of blood meal source. The 19 triatomines collected in the pig farm were of the species T. sherlocki, comprising 26.3% nymphs (5/19), 52.6% males (10/19) and 21.1% females (4/19). PCR showed that 15.8% (3/19) of triatomines were infected by T. cruzi. The only detected blood meal source in triatomines (n = 11) was the domestic mammal Sus scrofa, commonly known as domestic pig, indicating that T. sherlocki is an opportunist, feeding on available vertebrates in the environment, including domestic animals such as pigs.

"The interplay between temperature, Trypanosoma cruzi parasite load, and nutrition: Their effects on the development and life-cycle of the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius prolixus","Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi transmitted by blood-sucking insects of the subfamily Triatominae, is a major neglected tropical disease affecting 6 to 7 million of people worldwide. Rhodnius prolixus, one of the most important vectors of Chagas disease in Latin America, is known to be highly sensitive to environmental factors, including temperature. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different temperatures on R. prolixus development and life-cycle, its relationship with T. cruzi, and to gather information about the nutritional habits and energy consumption of R. prolixus. We exposed uninfected and infected R. prolixus to four different temperatures ranging from 24°C to 30°C, and monitored their survival, developmental rate, body and blood meal masses, urine production, and the temporal dynamics of parasite concentration in the excreted urine of the triatomines over the course of their development. Our results demonstrate that temperature significantly impacts R. prolixus development, life-cycle and their relationship with T. cruzi, as R. prolixus exposed to higher temperatures had a shorter developmental time and a higher mortality rate compared to those exposed to lower temperatures, as well as a lower ability to retain weight between blood meals. Infection also decreased the capacity of the triatomines to retain weight gained by blood-feeding to the next developmental stage, and this effect was proportional to parasite concentration in excreted urine. We also showed that T. cruzi multiplication varied depending on temperature, with the lowest temperature having the lowest parasite load. Our findings provide important insights into the potential impact of climate change on the epidemiology of Chagas disease, and can contribute to efforts to model the future distribution of this disease. Our study also raises new questions, highlighting the need for further research in order to understand the complex interactions between temperature, vector biology, and parasite transmission.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/efbc0c6790e1bdc6f6387fc60cce77c173cf6aa2,efbc0c6790e1bdc6f6387fc60cce77c173cf6aa2,"Henri Loshouarn, A.

Comparative proteomic analysis of the hemolymph and salivary glands of Rhodnius prolixus and R. colombiensis reveals candidates associated with differential lytic activity against Trypanosoma cruzi Dm28c and T. cruzi Y,"Background Immune response of triatomines plays an important role in the success or failure of transmission of T. cruzi. Studies on parasite–vector interaction have shown the presence of trypanolytic factors and have been observed to be differentially expressed among triatomines, which affects the transmission of some T. cruzi strains or DTUs (Discrete Typing Units). Methodology/Principal findings Trypanolytic factors were detected in the hemolymph and saliva of R. prolixus against epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of the Y strain (T. cruzi II). To identify the components of the immune response that could be involved in this lytic activity, a comparative proteomic analysis was carried out, detecting 120 proteins in the hemolymph of R. prolixus and 107 in R. colombiensis. In salivary glands, 1103 proteins were detected in R. prolixus and 853 in R. colombiensis. A higher relative abundance of lysozyme, prolixin, nitrophorins, and serpin as immune response proteins was detected in the hemolymph of R. prolixus. Among the R. prolixus salivary proteins, a higher relative abundance of nitrophorins, lipocalins, and triabins was detected. The higher relative abundance of these immune factors in R. prolixus supports their participation in the lytic activity on Y strain (T. cruzi II), but not on Dm28c (T. cruzi I), which is resistant to lysis by hemolymph and salivary proteins of R. prolixus due to mechanisms of evading oxidative stress caused by immune factors. Conclusions/Significance The lysis resistance observed in the Dm28c strain would be occurring at the DTU I level. T. cruzi I is the DTU with the greatest geographic distribution, from the south of the United States to central Chile and Argentina, a distribution that could be related to resistance to oxidative stress from vectors. Likewise, we can say that lysis against strain Y could occur at the level of DTU II and could be a determinant of the vector inability of these species to transmit T. cruzi II. Future proteomic and transcriptomic studies on vectors and the interactions of the intestinal microbiota with parasites will help to confirm the determinants of successful or failed vector transmission of T. cruzi DTUs in different parts of the Western Hemisphere.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/462e35377bcccb65ebbb8740ed4236596024b147,462e35377bcccb65ebbb8740ed4236596024b147,"Hamilton J.

A scoping review of triatomine control for Chagas disease prevention: current and developing tools in Latin America and the United States.,"Chagas disease is an infectious disease of human and animal health concern, with 6-8 million chronic human infections and over 50,000 deaths throughout the Americas annually. Hematophagous insects of the subfamily Triatominae, also called kissing bugs, vector the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas (Trypanosomatida: Trypanosomatidae), that causes Chagas disease. Despite the large human health burden, Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease with inadequate funding for research and preventive practices. Given the resource-poor environment of most agencies trying to protect public health, it is critical to consider all control options for reducing vector populations and the risk of human exposure to T. cruzi to identify the most appropriate tools for each context. While numerous triatomine control methods exist, the literature lacks a compilation of the strategies used, a critical examination of their efficiency, and a particular focus on triatomine control in the United States compared to elsewhere in the Americas. Here, we present a review of the literature to assess historical intervention strategies of existing and developing triatomine control methods. For each method, we discuss progress in the field, future research to further advance the method, and limitations.

Trypanosomes and Gut Microbiota Interactions in Triatomine bugs and Tsetse Flies: A vectorial perspective.,"Triatomines (kissing bugs) and tsetse flies (genus: Glossina) are natural vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei, respectively. T. cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease, endemic in Latin America, while T. brucei causes African sleeping sickness disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Both triatomines and tsetse flies are host to a diverse community of gut microbiota that co-exist with the parasites in the gut. Evidence has shown that the gut microbiota of both vectors plays a key role in parasite development and transmission. However, knowledge on the mechanism involved in parasite-microbiota interaction remains limited and scanty. Here, we attempt to analyse Trypanosoma spp. and gut microbiota interactions in tsetse flies and triatomines, with a focus on understanding the possible mechanisms involved by reviewing published articles on the subject. We report that interactions between Trypanosoma spp. and gut microbiota can be both direct and indirect. In direct interactions, the gut microbiota directly affects the parasite via the formation of biofilms and the production of anti-parasitic molecules, while on the other hand, Trypanosoma spp. produces antimicrobial proteins to regulate gut microbiota of the vector. In indirect interactions, the parasite and gut bacteria affect each other through host vector-activated processes such as immunity and metabolism. Although we are beginning to understand how gut microbiota interacts with the Trypanosoma parasites, there is still a need for further studies on functional role of gut microbiota in parasite development to maximize the use of symbiotic bacteria in vector and parasite control.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f6aa916e434a6313fdcfe134b485831be70eb90c,f6aa916e434a6313fdcfe134b485831be70eb90c,"Zeph Nelson Omondi, Ayşe Caner, S.

Influence of temperature variability on the feeding behavior and blood consumption of Triatoma infestans (Hemiptera: Reduviidae).,"The transmission and incidence of vector-borne diseases rely on vector distribution and life history traits such as survival, fecundity, and feeding.

This parasite is transmitted when the feces of the infected triatomine enter the bloodstream of the host. One of the most important vector-species of this disease in the Southern Cone region of South America is Triatoma infestans. In this study, we evaluated the role of constant and variable environmental temperature on the feeding behavior of T. infestans. Fifth-instar nymphs were acclimatized to 4 thermal treatments comprising 2 temperatures (27 °C and 18 °C) with and without diurnal thermal variability (27 ± 5 °C and 18 ± 5 °C). Individuals were fed weekly for 7 wk to quantify their feeding. Our results showed lower feeding frequency in nymphs acclimatized to cold temperature compared to those from warmer temperature treatments. However, treatments with thermal variability presented a nonlinear effect on feeding, with an increased feeding rate in the cold, variable treatment and a decreased feeding rate in the warm, variable treatment. Individuals maintained under cold treatments, the variable temperature exhibited a higher feeding rate and the lowest amount of ingested blood among all treatments. Thus, natural diurnal temperature variation cannot be ignored if we are to make more accurate T. cruzi transmission risk predictions now and in the future.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d62d1064659af29ab9c39f9b92648b893714952c,d62d1064659af29ab9c39f9b92648b893714952c,"Bárbara Álvarez-Duhart, G.

"Development of an operational trap for collection, killing, and preservation of triatomines (Hemiptera: Reduviidae): the kissing bug kill trap.","Surveillance of triatomines or kissing bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae), the insect vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, a Chagas disease agent, is hindered by the lack of an effective trap. To develop a kissing bug trap, we made iterative improvements over 3 years on a basic design resulting in 7 trap prototypes deployed across field sites in Texas, United States and Northern Mexico, yielding the capture of 325 triatomines of 4 species (Triatoma gerstaeckeri [Stål], T. sanguisuga [LeConte], T. neotomae [Neiva], and T. rubida [Uhler]). We began in 2019 with vertical transparent tarpaulin panel traps illuminated with artificial light powered by AC current, which were successful in autonomous trapping of flying triatomines, but were expensive, labor-intensive, and fragile. In 2020, we switched to white LED lights powered by a solar cell. We tested a scaled-down version of the vertical panel traps, a commercial cross-vane trap, and a multiple-funnel trap. The multiple-funnel traps captured 2.6× more kissing bugs per trap-day than cross-vane traps and approached the performance of the vertical panel traps in number of triatomines captured, number of triatomines per trap-day and triatomines per arthropod bycatch. Multiple-funnel traps required the least labor, were more durable, and had the highest triatomines per day per cost. Propylene glycol in the collection cups effectively preserved captured triatomines allowing for molecular detection of T. cruzi. The trapping experiments established dispersal patterns for the captured species. We conclude that multiple-funnel traps with solar-powered LED lights should be considered for adoption as surveillance and potentially mass-trapping management tools for triatomines.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10af029b798c2ddd43c09cd8da532aa65fc358b0,10af029b798c2ddd43c09cd8da532aa65fc358b0,"G.

Oral Chagas Disease in Colombia—Confirmed and Suspected Routes of Transmission,"Chagas disease (CD) remains endemic throughout many regions of Colombia despite implementing decades of vector control strategies in several departments. Some regions have had a significant decrease in vectorial transmission, but the oral ingestion of Trypanosoma cruzi through consumption of contaminated food and drink products is increasingly described. This form of transmission has important public health relevance in Colombia due to an increase in reported acute CD cases and clinical manifestations that often lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Oral CD in Colombia has been associated with the consumption of contaminated fruit juices, such as palm wine, sugar cane, or tangerine juice and water for consumption, or contaminated surfaces where food has been prepared. Another interesting route of oral transmission includes ingestion of unbeknownst infected armadillos’ blood, which is related to a traditional medicine practice in Colombia. Some earlier reports have also implemented consumption of infected bush meat as a source, but this is still being debated. Within the Amazon Basin, oral transmission is now considered the principal cause of acute CD in these regions. Furthermore, new cases of acute CD are now being seen in departments where CD has not been documented, and triatomine vectors are not naturally found, thus raising suspicion for oral transmission. The oral CD could also be considered a food-borne zoonosis, and odoriferous didelphid secretions have been implemented in contaminating the human dwelling environment, increasing the risk of consumption of infectious metacyclic trypomastigotes. In this article, we will discuss the complex transmission dynamics of oral CD in Colombia and further examine the unique clinical manifestations of this route of infection. New insights into the oral transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi are being discovered in Colombia, which can help bring increased awareness and a better understanding of this neglected tropical disease to reduce the burden of CD throughout Latin America.",2024,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc0186c7ad4a5b90a5c67c2fcf68f12ebe8f0e08,bc0186c7ad4a5b90a5c67c2fcf68f12ebe8f0e08,"Norman L.

Gene Editing in the Chagas Disease Vector Rhodnius prolixus by Cas9-Mediated ReMOT Control.,"Rhodnius prolixus is currently the model vector of choice for studying Chagas disease transmission, a debilitating disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasites. However, transgenesis and gene editing protocols to advance the field are still lacking. Here, we tested protocols for the maternal delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly spaced palindromic repeats/Cas-9 associated) elements to developing R. prolixus oocytes and strategies for the identification of insertions and deletions (indels) in target loci of resulting gene-edited generation zero (G0) nymphs. We demonstrate successful gene editing of the eye color markers Rp-scarlet and Rp-white, and the cuticle color marker Rp-yellow, with highest effectiveness obtained using Receptor-Mediated Ovary Transduction of Cargo (ReMOT Control) with the ovary-targeting BtKV ligand. These results provide proof of concepts for generating somatic mutations in R. prolixus and potentially for generating germ line-edited lines in triatomines, laying the foundation for gene editing protocols that could lead to the development of novel control strategies for vectors of Chagas disease.",2024,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/909a9e0213d9e39895db6b36d3d7b6872f8c46c2,909a9e0213d9e39895db6b36d3d7b6872f8c46c2,"Leonardo Lima, M.

Sugar feeding in triatomines: a new perspective for controlling the transmission of Chagas disease,"Introduction: Triatomines are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Currently, there is no vaccine against this disease. Thus, control of the insect vector population is the main strategy available to reduce the number of cases. Triatomines are considered obligate hematophagous, but different alternative feeding behaviors were described, such as haemolymphagy or plant feeding. Methods: To determine the preference for sugar feeding in nymphs and adults of Rhodnius prolixus, the insects were exposed a piece of cotton containing bromophenol blue plus sucrose. In addition, we offered several sugars for different species of triatomines, and tested sugar meals as a route of delivery of insecticides in first-instar nymphs of R. prolixus. The effect of sugar feeding on the physiology of these different species of triatomines was recorded. Results: First instar nymphs ingested sucrose more strongly than other stages, and showed high mortality rates. In different species of triatomines, sucrose induced an ingestion, but engorgement varied according to the species. R. prolixus nymphs showed an indiscriminate intake of various sugars, with very different physiological effects. Furthermore, ingesting different combinations of insecticides + sugar significantly reduced insect survival. Discussion: In summary, we described for the first-time sugar feeding as a widespread behavior in several species of triatomines, and the possibility of the use of toxic sugar baits for the control of these vectors. The knowledge of feeding behavior in these insects can be fundamental for the development of new strategies to control Chagas disease.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69d910bc27e9debf8b03fe47bacfb9bfcddd7fb2,69d910bc27e9debf8b03fe47bacfb9bfcddd7fb2,"Mariana C.

Hidden life cycle stages of the trypanosomatid Blastocrithidia triatomae Cerisola et al. 1971 (Protista: Excavata: Kinetoplastea) unveiled by a new cultivation method,"Blastocrithidia triatomae is a monoxenic trypanosomatid parasite of triatomines, sharing the same insect vectors with Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, 1909 and T. rangeli Tejera, 1920. It is known to cause a complex syndrome in insects which induces severe metabolic disorders and increasing in mortality rates. In the present study, we established an efficient serial axenic cultivation method for B. triatomae using a new medium, herein called MBT, which revealed previously unknown morphotypes, named microepimastigotes and sinemastigotes, not found in specific cell linage cultures. The results improve the knowledge on the life cycle of genus Blastocrithidia Laird 1959, its distinction from other trypanosomatids, such as T. cruzi and T. rangeli, and settle new ground for thorough exploration of morphological features and its application for trypanosomatid systematics.

"Zoonotic Cycle of American Trypanosomiasis in an Endemic Region of the Argentine Chaco, Factors That Influenced a Paradigm Shift","Simple Summary Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) poses a serious health problem in the American region, with approximately one-quarter of the Latin American population at risk of infection due to the geographical distribution of the insect vectors (Triatominae spp.). The transmission scenarios for this disease involve multiple interdependent factors. The parasite has developed, over evolutionary time, multiple strategies that have enabled its successful survival. The variables governing the transmission cycle are diverse and unique to each ecological scenario. Human intervention, such as deforestation, large-scale changes in land use, and loss of biodiversity, in the Chaco region over many years, along with sustained control interventions, may have significantly impacted the structure of wild transmission cycles and their relationships with the environment. This could potentially reduce the prevalence of the parasite in the domestic cycle. This study aims to describe the transmission dynamics of the sylvatic cycle of T. cruzi, identify factors determining potential zoonotic spillover, and explore how they could contribute to the elimination of Chagas disease as a public health problem in this area of Argentina. Abstract Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis), is a highly complex zoonosis that is present throughout South America, Central America, and Mexico. The transmission of this disease is influenced by various factors, including human activities like deforestation and land use changes, which may have altered the natural transmission cycles and their connection to the environment. In this study conducted in the Argentine Chaco region, we examined the transmission dynamics of T. cruzi by collecting blood samples from wild and domestic animals, as well as triatomine bugs from human dwellings, across five sites of varying anthropic intervention. Samples were analyzed for T. cruzi infection via qPCR, and we additionally examined triatomines for bloodmeal analysis via NGS amplicon sequencing. Our analysis revealed a 15.3% infection rate among 20 wild species (n = 123) and no T. cruzi presence in 9 species of domestic animals (n = 1359) or collected triatomines via qPCR. Additionally, we found chicken (34.28%), human (21.59%), and goat (19.36%) as the predominant bloodmeal sources across all sites. These findings suggest that anthropic intervention and other variables analyzed may have directly impacted the spillover dynamics of T. cruzi’s sylvatic cycle and potentially reduced its prevalence in human habitats.",2024,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96959ff7353d9fdad3d89da017a17034ea6b2b30,96959ff7353d9fdad3d89da017a17034ea6b2b30,"Andrea Gómez-Bravo, Sebastián Cirignoli, D.

Trypanosoma cruzi Parasite Burdens of Several Triatomine Species in Colombia,"Trypanosoma cruzi, the causal agent of Chagas disease, is mainly transmitted by insects of the Triatominae subfamily. In Colombia, there are 26 triatomine species, and 16 of them are naturally infected with the parasite. The parasite loads of naturally infected vectors can be significant in targeting specific species that can affect the epidemiology of the disease. Studying their ecology and behavior is vital to understand their role in T. cruzi transmission dynamics. We evaluated the parasite loads of 182 field-collected triatomines corresponding to 10 species in 13 departments across Colombia. We standardized a methodology to quantify T. cruzi DNA in these insects. We obtained a LOD (limit of detection) of 3.05 p-eq/mL. The 82% of triatomines we evaluated were positive for T. cruzi infection, with loads ranging from hundreds to millions of equivalent parasites per milliliter. Panstrongylus geniculatus, Rhodnius prolixus, and Triatoma dimidiata were the species with the highest loads of T. cruzi; however, other species whose role as vectors is still unknown were also found with high loads of parasites. Our results suggest the relevance of secondary species for T. cruzi transmission in Colombia. We hope our data can help improve entomological surveillance and vector control programs in the country and the region.",2022,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c667ebab5eb20037445f4283b323bace7b6b86d,7c667ebab5eb20037445f4283b323bace7b6b86d,"Natalia Velásquez-Ortiz, C.

Blood-Meal Sources and Trypanosoma cruzi Infection in Coastal and Insular Triatomine Bugs from the Atacama Desert of Chile,"Mepraia parapatrica is one of the lesser known and less abundant sylvatic triatomine species naturally infected by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. M. parapatrica lives in sympatry with T. cruzi-infected rodents, but only birds, reptiles, and marine mammals have been reported as blood-meal sources of this vector species by serology. The distribution range of this kissing bug overlaps with fishers’ settlements and tourist areas, and therefore the study of the blood-meal sources of this triatomine species is relevant. Here, we determined the blood-meal sources of M. parapatrica by NGS or standard sequencing from a coastal mainland area and an island in northern Chile, and T. cruzi infection by real-time PCR. The blood-meals of. M parapatrica included 61.3% reptiles, 35.5% mammals (including humans) and 3.2% birds. Feeding on reptiles was more frequent on the mainland, while on the island feeding on mammals was more frequent. The presence of T. cruzi-infected triatomine bugs and humans as part of the diet of M. parapatrica in both areas represents an epidemiological threat and potential risk to the human population visiting or established in these areas. Currently there are no tools to control wild triatomines; these results highlight the potential risk of inhabiting these areas and the necessity of developing information campaigns for the community and surveillance actions.",2022,6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27f56cbfb6292129ffbc95ebd5b842b08bbeaf4a,27f56cbfb6292129ffbc95ebd5b842b08bbeaf4a,"N.

"RNA as a feasible marker of Trypanosoma cruzi viability during the parasite interaction with the triatomine vector Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera, Triatominae)","A recurring question concerning Trypanosoma cruzi DNA detection/quantification is related to the fact that DNA amplification, by itself, does not differentiate between viable or dead parasites. On the other hand, RNA can be considered a potential molecular marker of pathogens viability. Herein, we developed a quantitative real-time PCR with reverse Transcription (RT-qPCR) to quantify viable T. cruzi in artificially infected Rhodnius prolixus whilst evaluating differences between DNA and mRNA quantification along the insect midgut during 5, 9, 15 and 29 days after feeding. The RT-qPCR presented an improved performance with linearities ranging from 107 to 102 parasites equivalents and 3 to 0.0032 intestine unit equivalents, and efficiencies of 100.3% and 102.8% for both T. cruzi and triatomine targets, respectively. Comparing both RT-qPCR and qPCR, we confirmed that RNA is faster degraded, no longer being detected at day 1 after parasite lysis, while DNA detection was stable, with no decrease in parasite load over the days, even after parasite lysis. We also observed statistical differences between the quantification of the parasite load by DNA and by RNA on day 15 after feeding of experimentally infected R. prolixus. When assessing different portions of the digestive tract, by RT-qPCR, we could detect a statistically significant reduction in the parasite amount in the anterior midgut. Oppositely, there was a statistically significant increase of the parasite load in the hindgut. In conclusion, for this study parasite’s viability in R. prolixus digestive tract were assessed targeting T. cruzi mRNA. In addition, differences between DNA and RNA detection observed herein, raise the possibility that RNA is a potential molecular viability marker, which could contribute to understanding the dynamics of the parasite infection in invertebrate hosts.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50f679878360a9643cda6763e4fda9a3465decf9,50f679878360a9643cda6763e4fda9a3465decf9,"Paula Finamore-Araujo, Gabriel Lucio Silva da Fonseca, C.

"Enzootic Trypanosoma cruzi infection by Rhodnius prolixus shows transmission to humans and dogs in Vichada, Colombia","Background Rhodnius prolixus is considered the most relevant Trypanosoma cruzi vector in Colombia and Venezuela due it is responsible for domestic transmission in both countries. However, a wild population of this species is distributed in the eastern plains of the Orinoco region and Amazonia jungle, where its epidemiological importance has not been sufficiently elucidated. This study aimed to assess epidemiological parameters of T. cruzi transmission in the Department of Vichada, Colombia. Methods We determined the characteristics of T. cruzi transmission using entomological studies in domestic and sylvatic ecotopes. We analyzed the T. cruzi infection in triatomine insects, identified blood meal sources, and conducted a serological determination of T. cruzi infection in scholar-aged children, domestic dogs, and wild hosts. Results Fifty-four triatomine bugs, 40 T. maculata and 14 R. prolixus were collected in peridomestic and sylvatic ecotopes. Infected R. prolixus was observed in La Primavera, Santa Rosalia, and Cumaribo municipalities. All the T. maculata bugs were not infected.

"Identification of the parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, in multiple tissues of epidemiological significance in the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana): Implications for environmental and vertical transmission routes","Background Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasitic protozoan, is endemic to the Americas and the causative agent of Chagas disease in humans. In South America, opossums facilitate transmission via infected anal gland secretions in addition to transmission via triatomine vectors. In North America, the Virginia opossum is a reservoir host for the parasite with transmission routes that are not clearly defined. The unique biology of this marsupial provides the opportunity to investigate vertical transmission in this wildlife species in situ. Our objectives were to investigate alternative routes of transmission that may facilitate spillover into other species and to determine if vertical transmission was evident. Methodology/Principal findings Virginia opossums were sampled at 10 trapping locations over a 10-month period in a 5-county region of north central Florida. Peripheral blood, fecal swabs, and anal gland secretions were collected from each adult individual, and peripheral blood was collected from joey opossums. Total DNA was extracted from each collected sample type, and T. cruzi infected individuals and the infecting Discrete Typing Unit (DTU) were identified using real time PCR methods. Adult Virginia opossums (n = 112) were infected with T. cruzi (51.8%, 95% CI [42.6–60.8%]) throughout the sampled period and at each location. T. cruzi DNA was found in each of the three biological sample types. Vertical transmission of T. cruzi was inferred in one litter of mother-dependent (n = 20, 5.0%, 95% CI [0.9–23.6%]) joey opossums where 2 joeys from this same litter were rtPCR positive for T. cruzi. Conclusions/Significance We inferred vertical transmission from mother to neonate which may serve to amplify the prevalence of T. cruzi in adult Virginia opossums. T. cruzi DNA was detected in the anal gland secretions of Virginia opossums. Infected anal gland secretions suggest a possible environmental route of transmission for T. cruzi via the deposition of contaminated feces and spraint at wildlife latrines.

"Interrogating the transmission dynamics of Trypanosoma cruzi (Trypanosomatida, Trypanosomatidae) by Triatoma venosa (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) after the elimination of vector transmission by Rhodnius prolixus in Boyacá eastern Colombia","Graphical Abstract Chagas disease (CD) is a parasitic zoonosis (Trypanosoma cruzi) that is endemic in Colombia. Vector control of Rhodnius prolixus, the main domestic T. cruzi vector, has been achieved in a large part of the area with historically vector transmission of CD. It is necessary to understand the ecological behavior characteristics of local native vectors to ensure sustainability of the vector control programs. To evaluate the long-term success of a recent vector control campaign in the Boyacá department (Colombia), we used a combined strategy of entomological surveillance with co-existing canine surveillance from ten rural villages within six municipalities of the Tenza valley region (Boyacá, Colombia): Chinavita, Garagoa, Guateque, Somondoco, Sutatenza and Tenza, with historical reports of R. prolixus and secondary vectors. Collected triatomines and canine whole blood were analyzed for T. cruzi infection and genotyping. Triatomine bugs specimens were evaluated for blood meal source. Canine serology was performed using two distinct antibody assays. In total, 101 Triatoma venosa were collected by active search in domestic and peridomestic habitats. A natural infection prevalence of 13.9% (14/101) and four feeding sources were identified: human, dog, rat, and hen. A frequency infection of 46.5% (40/87) was observed from two independent serological tests and T. cruzi DNA was detected in 14 dogs (16.4%). Only TcIsylvatic DTU was detected. The results suggest that T. venosa present eco-epidemiological characteristics to maintain the transmission of T. cruzi in Tenza valley. This species has reinfested the intervened households and it has an active role in domestic and peridomestic transmission of T. cruzi due to their infection rates and feeding behavior. Therefore, this species should be considered as epidemiologically relevant for vector control strategies. Moreover, there is a need for human serological studies to have a close up of risk they are exposed to.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9e21f594ecbebceb537909e6edb1a0af13b5db85,9e21f594ecbebceb537909e6edb1a0af13b5db85,"M.

"Parasitemia and Differential Tissue Tropism in Mice Infected with Trypanosoma cruzi Isolates Obtained from Meccus phyllosoma in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico","Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasite transmitted by the feces of triatomines. Many triatomine species are found in Mexico, and various T. cruzi variants have been isolated from these species, each showing very different virulence and cell tropism. The isolates were obtained from Meccus phyllosoma specimens in three localities in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico: Tehuantitla, Vixhana, and Guichivere. The virulence of each isolate was assessed by quantifying parasitemia, survival, and histopathologic findings. The lineage of each isolate was identified using the mini-exon gene. The expression of the tssa gene during infection was detected in the heart, esophagus, gastrocnemius, and brain. Our results show that the maximum post-infection parasitemia was higher for the Tehuantitla isolate. On genotyping, all isolates were identified as T. cruzi I. The amastigotes in the heart and gastrocnemius were verified for all isolates, but in the brain only for Tehuantitla and Vixhana. The tssa expression allowed us to detect T. cruzi isolates, for Tehuantitla, predominantly in the heart. For Vixhana, a higher tssa expression was detected in gastrocnemius, and for Guichivere, it was higher in the esophagus.

The Parasite Load of Trypanosoma cruzi Modulates Feeding and Defecation Patterns of the Chagas Disease Vector Triatoma infestans,"Trypanosoma cruzi is the causal agent of Chagas disease, a parasitic zoonosis transmitted mainly through the feces of triatomine insects. Triatoma infestans is the main triatomine vector of this disease in South America. Previous research has shown that T. cruzi infection modifies the behavior of triatomines. We evaluated, for the first time, the effect of parasite load on feeding and defecation behavior, which we quantified by using real-time PCR. The detection time of the host was shorter in infected individuals, and the number of bites increased, while the dejection time was reduced when compared with the non-infected group. A significant correlation between the parasite load and the behavioral changes registered in the infected triatomines was found.

"An induced population of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes more resistant to complement lysis promotes a phenotype with greater differentiation, invasiveness, and release of extracellular vesicles","Introduction Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, which uses blood-feeding triatomine bugs as a vector to finally infect mammalian hosts. Upon entering the host, the parasite needs to effectively evade the attack of the complement system and quickly invade cells to guarantee an infection. In order to accomplish this, T. cruzi expresses different molecules on its surface and releases extracellular vesicles (EVs). Methods Here, we have selected a population of epimastigotes (a replicative form) from T. cruzi through two rounds of exposure to normal human serum (NHS), to reach 30% survival (2R population). This 2R population was characterized in several aspects and compared to Wild type population. Results The 2R population had a favored metacyclogenesis compared with wild-type (WT) parasites. 2R metacyclic trypomastigotes had a two-fold increase in resistance to complementmediated lysis and were at least three times more infective to eukaryotic cells, probably due to a higher GP82 expression in the resistant population. Moreover, we have shown that EVs from resistant parasites can transfer the invasive phenotype to the WT population. In addition, we showed that the virulence phenotype of the selected population remains in the trypomastigote form derived from cell culture, which is more infective and also has a higher rate of release of trypomastigotes from infected cells. Conclusions Altogether, these data indicate that it is possible to select parasites after exposure to a particular stress factor and that the phenotype of epimastigotes remained in the infective stage. Importantly, EVs seem to be an important virulence fator increasing mechanism in this context of survival and persistence in the host.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d8a52baf1a3506032d8f8ac700b03668049095e,0d8a52baf1a3506032d8f8ac700b03668049095e,"I.

Rhodnius prolixus Hemolymph Immuno-Physiology: Deciphering the Systemic Immune Response Triggered by Trypanosoma cruzi Establishment in the Vector Using Quantitative Proteomics,"Understanding the development of Trypanosoma cruzi within the triatomine vector at the molecular level should provide novel targets for interrupting parasitic life cycle and affect vectorial competence. The aim of the current study is to provide new insights into triatomines immunology through the characterization of the hemolymph proteome of Rhodnius prolixus, a major Chagas disease vector, in order to gain an overview of its immune physiology. Surprisingly, proteomics investigation of the immunomodulation of T. cruzi-infected blood reveals that the parasite triggers an early systemic response in the hemolymph. The analysis of the expression profiles of hemolymph proteins from 6 h to 24 h allowed the identification of a broad range of immune proteins expressed already in the early hours post-blood-feeding regardless of the presence of the parasite, ready to mount a rapid response exemplified by the significant phenol oxidase activation. Nevertheless, we have also observed a remarkable induction of the immune response triggered by an rpPGRP-LC and the overexpression of defensins 6 h post-T. cruzi infection. Moreover, we have identified novel proteins with immune properties such as the putative c1q-like protein and the immunoglobulin I-set domain-containing protein, which have never been described in triatomines and could play a role in T. cruzi recognition. Twelve proteins with unknown function are modulated by the presence of T. cruzi in the hemolymph. Determining the function of these parasite-induced proteins represents an exciting challenge for increasing our knowledge about the diversity of the immune response from the universal one studied in holometabolous insects. This will provide us with clear answers for misunderstood mechanisms in host–parasite interaction, leading to the development of new generation strategies to control vector populations and pathogen transmission.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66d71903ebaff7439786d69437bf238c532debda,66d71903ebaff7439786d69437bf238c532debda,"Radouane Ouali, Larissa Rezende Vieira, D.

"Domestic Triatoma spp. Infections with Trypanosoma cruzi, Household Infestations, and Molecular Identification in Oaxaca, México","Simple Summary Here, we report entomological and parasitological data on triatomine vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, in a highly endemic region of México. The morphological and molecular identification of four principal domestic species, Triatoma phyllosoma, T. barberi, T. mazzotti, and T. dimidiata, was conducted, and their presence in Oaxaca was documented based on observations from this study in comparison to municipality records from prior published studies. We document the highly endophilic behavior of four triatomine species infected with T. cruzi. The present work carried out in Oaxaca was necessary for ongoing efforts to reach the goal of reducing the Chagas disease burden in Mexico and beyond. Abstract In Latin America, Mexico is the country with the second highest annual estimated number of Chagas disease cases, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, due to vector-borne transmission. The state of Oaxaca is the location of the first documented human cases of Chagas disease in Mexico and contained the highest T. cruzi seropositive rate (3.5%) from blood donors. Here, entomological surveys, from 2017 to 2019, were conducted to collect triatomines in 124 villages of 60 municipalities. Four principal domestic Triatoma spp. (Hemiptera: Triatominae), Triatoma phyllosoma, T. barberi, T. mazzotti, and T. dimidiata, of Oaxaca, Mexico were identified by morphology and molecular analysis of the barcode region of the cytochrome oxidase 1 (cox1 or COI or CO1) gene. A total of 41 out of 83 T. phyllosoma specimens examined by microscopy were positive for T. cruzi (49%), 49 out of 171 for T. barberi (28%), 31 out of 177 for T. mazzotti (17%), and none out of 10 for T. dimidiata (0%). Overall, the infestation index was 3.1% of households containing at least one triatomine; the crowding index was a mean of two Triatoma spp./household; and the colonization index was 0.38 for households based on presence of nymphs. Geographical distribution of triatomines in Oaxaca at the municipality level and endophilic behavior is also reported. Precise identification, endophilic habits, and infection rates of these triatomines are paramount for vector control programs of the Ministry of Health of Oaxaca and beyond.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d13fc0f182a909da5fd34dde932ca9770e5a8e8,6d13fc0f182a909da5fd34dde932ca9770e5a8e8,"Nadia A Fernandez-Santos, J.

"Genetic diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi strains isolated from chronic chagasic patients and non-human hosts in the state of São Paulo, Brazil","BACKGROUND Trypanosoma cruzi shows an exuberant genetic diversity. Currently, seven phylogenetic lineages, called discrete typing units (DTUs), are recognised: TcI-TcVI and Tcbat. Despite advances in studies on T. cruzi and its populations, there is no consensus regarding its heterogeneity. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to perform molecular characterisation of T. cruzi strains, isolated in the state of São Paulo, to identify the DTUs involved and evaluate their genetic diversity. METHODS T. cruzi strains were isolated from biological samples of chronic chagasic patients, marsupials and triatomines through culture techniques and subjected to molecular characterisation using the fluorescent fragment length barcoding (FFLB) technique. Subsequently, the results were correlated with complementary information to enable better discrimination between the identified DTUs. FINDINGS It was possible to identify TcI in two humans and two triatomines; TcII/VI in 19 humans, two marsupials and one triatomine; and TcIII in one human host, an individual that also presented a result for TcI, which indicated the possibility of a mixed infection. Regarding the strains characterised by the TcII/VI profile, the correlation with complementary information allowed to suggest that, in general, these parasite populations indeed correspond to the TcII genotype. MAIN CONCLUSIONS The TcII/VI profile, associated with domestic cycles and patients with chronic Chagas disease, was the most prevalent among the identified DTUs. Furthermore, the correlation of the study results with complementary information made it possible to suggest that TcII is the predominant lineage of this work.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c1f5d8ba5aac383c7d9bb9a134b3905fab1342e,7c1f5d8ba5aac383c7d9bb9a134b3905fab1342e,"Thiago Kury Moreno de Souza, E.

"Trypanosoma cruzi and Chagas disease: diversity, progress and challenges","Diversity The wide-ranging diversity of T. cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, became clear when multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) analysis of human genetics was transposed to trypanosomatids, initially to Trypanosoma brucei, and then to T. cruzi. The application of MLEE to a rural area of Brazil, published in 1977, revealed two radically distinct genetic groups of T. cruzi, one associated with domestic transmission by the triatomine Panstrongylus megistus and the other with sylvatic transmission by Triatoma tibiamaculata.(1) Strikingly, comparisons of T. cruzi MLEE diversity in Venezuela, published in 1981, revealed that the principal domestic disease agent in Venezuela corresponded to the prevalent sylvatic T. cruzi in the rural region of Brazil.(2) This led to the hypothesis that different clinical presentations of Chagas disease in Brazil and Venezuela might be associated with the two distinct MLEE ‘zymodemes’ of T. cruzi.(2) As indicated, in the detailed review of Messenger et al.,(3) there followed a series of wide-ranging MLEE analyses of T. cruzi strains, which included the Amazon region (1978,1981,1984) Bolivia (1983, with Michel Tibayrenc), Chile (1984,1987, with Werner Apt), Paraguay (1984), Colombia (1985), Ecuador (1985), Central Brazil (1986). An outcome of this research was the identification and distribution of six different MLEE groups of T. cruzi, as summarised in Table I of the review of Messenger et al.,(3) and with some evidence of hybrid isoenzyme profiles. The advent of multilocus sequence typing (MLST), led to a more robust and direct genetic analysis of T. cruzi isolates. Souto et al.,(4) cited in the Zingales and Bartholomeu review, used MLST to confirm presence of the same two principal genetic groups of T. cruzi that were identified in 1977 by MLEE in Brazil.(1) Brisse et al.,(5) used a combination of MLST targets and confirmed the presence of six principal lineages (or distinct taxonomic units, DTUs), which corresponded with the six groups previously identified by MLEE. The six Brisse DTUs were initially named TcI and TcIIa to TcIIe. However, the initial MLST nomenclature of Brisse et al. did not appropriately represent the relationship between the six lineages. Therefore, TcI to TcVI was suggested as an alternative, with TcV and TcVI recognised as hybrids of TcII and TcIII.(6) This nomenclature was adopted in the 2009 revision meeting organised by Zingales, as cited in the current review. Recently, a seventh DTU has been proposed, similar to TcI. It is conceivable that more DTUs remain to be discovered.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/186835ef6460bd63e8abc862852be4f17528f7b1,186835ef6460bd63e8abc862852be4f17528f7b1,M. Miles
"New Cell Lines Derived from Laboratory Colony Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus, Vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, Do Not Harbour Triatoma Virus","Simple Summary Arthropod vector cell lines play an important role in research on the biology and control of blood-feeding insects and the diseases they transmit. Kissing bugs of the genera Triatoma and Rhodnius transmit Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease in humans in tropical Latin America. We have developed new cell lines from two of the major vectors of T. cruzi, Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus, and have shown that they do not harbour any contaminating bacteria or known insect-borne viruses. We propose that the new cell lines may be suitable host cells for Triatoma virus, a natural pathogen of T. infestans that has been proposed as a biocontrol agent but cannot be grown in existing cell lines. The new cell lines may also be used to study interactions between trypanosomes and cells of their vectors. Abstract Triatomine bugs of the genera Triatoma and Rhodnius are vectors of Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease of humans in South America caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Triatoma virus (TrV), a natural pathogen of Triatoma infestans, has been proposed as a possible tool for the bio-control of triatomine bugs, but research into this virus has been hampered by a lack of suitable host cells for in vitro propagation. Here we report establishment and partial characterisation of continuous cell lines from embryos of T. infestans (TIE/LULS54) and Rhodnius prolixus (RPE/LULS53 and RPE/LULS57). RNAseq screening by a sequence-independent, single primer amplification approach confirmed the absence of TrV and other RNA viruses known to infect R. prolixus, indicating that these new cell lines could be used for propagation of TrV.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07d1925291f47ef37025ec59ffa7396fcbd9042f,07d1925291f47ef37025ec59ffa7396fcbd9042f,"Rebekah Penrice-Randal, Catherine Hartley, A.

Impact of home improvements and health education on the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas in a rural area of western Mexico,"ABSTRACT: Chagas disease is one of the most important vector-borne diseases in Latin America. Instituting home improvement preventive measures and increasing health education contribute to successful control of the triatomine insect vector. The impact of home and road improvements and health education upon the inhabitants of 37 human dwellings in three small towns in western Mexico were studied. Initially, few house roofs were made of concrete and few walls were cement-lined. Almost all houses initially lacked metal window screens and none used barbed wire fences. One year after the intervention, all of these measures were more common, and almost 100% of houses continued to use window screens and barbed wire fences ten years post-intervention. By ten years post-intervention, >75% of houses had cement-lined walls. Initially, 24.3% of human dwellings were infested with Triatoma longipennis Usinger; at one and ten years post-intervention, only 2.7% of dwellings were infested. The abundance of peridomestic opossums decreased after intervention and remained low ten years later. Approximately 10% of dogs were infected in both surveys. Human infections decreased from 2.98% to zero by 13 years post-intervention. Implementation of these intervention measures led to the successful control of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas transmission in these towns.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ad779ee45b69eb2c9462118ff9d0e47dbb34d1f1,ad779ee45b69eb2c9462118ff9d0e47dbb34d1f1,"B.

"Toward New Epidemiological Landscapes of Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida, Trypanosomatidae) Transmission under Future Human-Modified Land Cover and Climatic Change in Mexico","Chagas disease, caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi, is an important yet neglected disease that represents a severe public health problem in the Americas. Although the alteration of natural habitats and climate change can favor the establishment of new transmission cycles for T. cruzi, the compound effect of human-modified landscapes and current climate change on the transmission dynamics of T. cruzi has until now received little attention. A better understanding of the relationship between these factors and T. cruzi presence is an important step towards finding ways to mitigate the future impact of this disease on human communities. Here, we assess how wild and domestic cycles of T. cruzi transmission are related to human-modified landscapes and climate conditions (LUCC-CC). Using a Bayesian datamining framework, we measured the correlations among the presence of T. cruzi transmission cycles (sylvatic, rural, and urban) and historical land use, land cover, and climate for the period 1985 to 2012. We then estimated the potential range changes of T. cruzi transmission cycles under future land-use and -cover change and climate change scenarios for 2050 and 2070 time-horizons, with respect to “green” (RCP 2.6), “business-as-usual” (RCP 4.5), and “worst-case” (RCP 8.5) scenarios, and four general circulation models. Our results show how sylvatic and domestic transmission cycles could have historically interacted through the potential exchange of wild triatomines (insect vectors of T. cruzi) and mammals carrying T. cruzi, due to the proximity of human settlements (urban and rural) to natural habitats. However, T. cruzi transmission cycles in recent times (i.e., 2011) have undergone a domiciliation process where several triatomines have colonized and adapted to human dwellings and domestic species (e.g., dogs and cats) that can be the main blood sources for these triatomines. Accordingly, Chagas disease could become an emerging health problem in urban areas. Projecting potential future range shifts of T. cruzi transmission cycles under LUCC-CC scenarios we found for RCP 2.6 no expansion of favourable conditions for the presence of T. cruzi transmission cycles. However, for RCP 4.5 and 8.5, a significant range expansion of T. cruzi could be expected. We conclude that if sustainable goals are reached by appropriate changes in socio-economic and development policies we can expect no increase in suitable habitats for T. cruzi transmission cycles.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/219612d81c2d87f1131f0f7ec048ca564f91fb02,219612d81c2d87f1131f0f7ec048ca564f91fb02,"C.

"Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma rangeli in Acre, Brazilian Amazonia: Coinfection and Notable Genetic Diversity in an Outbreak of Orally Acquired Acute Chagas Disease in a Forest Community, Wild Reservoirs, and Vectors","Acute Chagas disease (ACD) caused by Trypanosoma cruzi has emerged as a major food-borne disease in Brazilian Amazonia. For the first time, we characterized an outbreak of orally acquired ACD in Acre, in the forest community of Seringal Miraflores, affecting 13 individuals who shared the pulp of açai palm berries: 11 adults and two children (one newborn), all diagnosed by thick-drop blood smears. The fluorescent fragment length barcoding method, which simultaneously identifies species/genotypes of trypanosomes in blood samples, uncovered an unprecedented genetic diversity in patients from a single outbreak of ACD: T. cruzi TcI in all patients, mostly concomitantly with the non-pathogenic Trypanosoma rangeli of genotypes TrA or TrB, and TcI, TcIV, and TrB in the child. The patients presented persistent fever, asthenia, myalgia, edema of the face and lower limbs, hepatosplenomegaly and, rarely, cardiac arrhythmia. The clinical symptoms were not correlated to gender, age, or to trypanosome species and genotypes. The inferred SSU rRNA phylogenetic analyses of trypanosomes from humans, triatomines and sylvatic hosts included the first sequences of T. cruzi and T. rangeli from humans in southwestern (Acre and Rondônia) Amazonia, and the first TcI/TcIV sequences from Rhodnius spp. from Acre. The sylvatic transmission cycles of genetically different trypanosomes in landscapes changed by deforestation for human settlements and increasing açai production is a novel scenario favoring trypanosome transmission to humans in Acre.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ce87193aed1d1ddc63c0ad131ebfbdb0bdcb79cc,ce87193aed1d1ddc63c0ad131ebfbdb0bdcb79cc,"José Gabriel Vergara-Meza, A.

"Profile of natural Trypanosoma cruzi infection among dogs from rural areas of southern Espírito Santo, Brazil","ABSTRACT Background: The emergence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection via oral transmission has a habitual character in its primitive endemic cycle. Recent findings revealed the first death by oral transmission of T. cruzi in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, in 2012, which was recorded in the rural area of Guarapari. This study evaluated the characteristics related to the occurrence of natural T. cruzi infection among dogs from the rural areas of Alegre and Iconha, municipalities of Espírito Santo. Methods: Logistic regression analysis of factors contributing to serological detection of T. cruzi in dogs was performed in environments where Espírito Santo’s Department of Health Surveillance had previously notified triatomines positive for Trypanosoma spp. from 2014 to 2017. Results: A total of 36 dogs were analyzed, of which 10 (27.77%) tested positive, one was borderline (2.79%), and 25 tested negative (69.44%) for T. cruzi infection. São Caetano, a district from the Iconha municipality, presented a 25 times greater chance for the detection of positive tests (OR:25; 95% CI; 2.37->100).

Trypanosoma cruzi Parasite Load Modulates the Circadian Activity Pattern of Triatoma infestans,"Simple Summary We studied the locomotor activity of one of the kissing bug species that transmit the Chagas disease-causing parasite in humans, which usually bites during the night. To date, no other reports researching its behavior take into account the amount of parasites inside the kissing bug; however, some studies have demonstrated that the presence of parasites modifies the activity of some kissing bug species. We recorded their movements in light and dark conditions after part of the insects fed on mammals that had the parasite and others fed on those that did not have the parasite. Later, their amounts of parasites were quantified. We found that, compared with insects with no parasites, kissing bugs with higher parasite amounts increase the number of times they move and the distance they travel, especially during daylight hours. This could imply that the insect increases its time searching for a food source when it is infected with a higher number of parasites, and this could increase the risk of transmission of the parasite to people by the kissing bug. Abstract American trypanosomiasis is a disease caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted mainly in endemic areas by blood-sucking triatomine vectors. Triatoma infestans is the most important vector in the southern cone of South America, exhibiting a nocturnal host-seeking behavior. It has been previously documented that the parasite produces changes in some triatomine species, but this is the first time that the behavior of a vector has been evaluated in relation to its parasite load. After comparing the movement events and distance traveled of infected and non-infected T. infestans, we evaluated the change produced by different T. cruzi parasite loads on its circadian locomotor activity. We observed differences between infected and non-infected triatomines, and a significant relation between the parasite load and the increase in locomotor activity of T. infestans, which was accentuated during the photophase. This could have direct implications on the transmission of T. cruzi, as the increased movement and distance traveled could enhance the contact of the vector with the host, while increasing the predation risk for the vector, which could both constitute a risk for vectorial and oral transmission to mammals.",2022,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/24e6cd8a4176ab10a4db939436c52ebca2bd00cb,24e6cd8a4176ab10a4db939436c52ebca2bd00cb,"F.

"Southwestern national park service employee risk, knowledge, and concern for triatomine exposure: A qualitative analysis using a novel knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey","Chagas disease (CD), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected parasitic infection in the United States (US). In the Southwestern US, National Park Service (NPS) employees are a unique population with potential exposure to CD. This population lives in close contact with several species of sylvatic triatomine bugs, the vectors of T. cruzi, that may enter residential buildings at night. Despite the higher potential risk of CD transmission for southwestern NPS employees, the socio-cultural factors that impact autochthonous CD transmission in the US remain unknown. To address this gap, we investigated how NPS employee knowledge and attitudes impact their triatomine preventive behaviors. We distributed a 42-item online questionnaire to NPS employees at four national parks in Arizona and Texas. We detected high self-reported bite exposure in NPS housing, despite moderate- to high-frequency of prevention behaviors. Specific behaviors, such as often or always repairing window screens, were associated with a decreased risk of putative triatomine bug exposure. Additionally, NPS employees had low knowledge of CD. For those with greater knowledge of CD, it was not associated with increased frequency of prevention behavior. We found that increased CD anxiety was associated with increased personal agency to reduce the risk of CD. These results demonstrate the influence of knowledge and attitudes regarding CD on triatomine prevention behavior within a potential high-risk population in the US, and the importance of utilizing strategies beyond provision of education to influence behaviors.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73f6e701cf4b79b5902c50c09d9af53efb2e46d6,73f6e701cf4b79b5902c50c09d9af53efb2e46d6,"Antonio Alvarado, Emily M.

The Neglected Virome of Triatomine Insects,"The Triatominae subfamily (Reduviidae) harbors some hematophagous insect species that have been firmly connected to the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Triatomines not only host and transmit trypanosomatids, but also coexist with a variety of symbiotic microorganisms that generally reside in the insect’s intestinal flora. The microbiome has profound effects on the physiology, immunity, fitness and survival of animals and plants. The interaction between triatomines and bacteria has been investigated to some extent and has revealed important bacteria symbionts. In contrast, the range of viral species that can infect triatomine insects is almost completely unknown. In some cases, genomic and metatranscriptomic approaches have uncovered sequences related to possible viral genomes, but, to date, only eight positive single-strand RNA viruses, namely Triatoma virus and Rhodnius prolixus viruses 1 - 7 have been investigated in more detail. Here, we review the literature available on triatomine viruses and the viruses-insect host relationship. The lack of broader metagenomic and metatranscriptomic studies in these medically relevant insects underscores the importance of expanding our knowledge of the triatomine virome both for surveillance purposes as well as to possibly harness their potential for insect vector population control strategies.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d7f12ae8e4c38aa0347c548b70463829ae0dd8cc,d7f12ae8e4c38aa0347c548b70463829ae0dd8cc,"M.

Detection of Trypansoma cruzi in Kissing Bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae) Collected Across Oklahoma,"Abstract Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease in humans and dogs in the Americas. Transmission predominantly occurs via the feces of infected kissing bugs (Hemiptera: family Reduviidae; subfamily Triatominae) contaminating bite site wounds or mucous membranes. To better understand Chagas disease entomologic risk in Oklahoma, kissing bugs collected from within the state were tested for T. cruzi DNA. Data including county of insect collection, species and instar, and specific locations where specimens were found were collated. Triatomines were also tested by PCR to potentially identify DNA of vertebrate species on which specimens had recently fed. In total, 110 kissing bugs from 22 counties were tested. All triatomines were identified as Triatoma sanguisuga nymphs or adults, with the exception of one possible T. lecticularia adult. Trypanosoma cruzi DNA was detected in 22 (20%) triatomines from 12 counties spanning the state. The majority of T. cruzi PCR positive kissing bugs were found inside homes or associated structures (i.e., garages, porches). Vertebrate DNA was identified in 27 (24.5%) triatomines, with human DNA detected in 25 (92.6%) of these specimens, and canine and raccoon DNA detected in one specimen each (3.7%).Two specimens tested positive for both T. cruzi and human DNA and one specimen tested positive for both T. cruzi and raccoon DNA. Results from this study indicate that kissing bugs carrying T. cruzi are widespread in Oklahoma, that positive kissing bugs infest homes and associated structures, and that human-vector, canine-vector, and wildlife-vector contact all occur within the state.",2022,3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/204883b0bee4ee82a11079d54bfd3e643caf444d,204883b0bee4ee82a11079d54bfd3e643caf444d,"Kelly E.

Dynamics of Triatoma infestans populations in the Paraguayan Chaco: Population genetic analysis of household reinfestation following vector control,"Background Although domestic infestations by Triatoma infestans have been successfully controlled across Latin America, in areas of the Gran Chaco region, recurrent post-spraying house colonization continues to be a significant challenge, jeopardizing Chagas disease vector control and maintaining active Trypanosoma cruzi transmission. Methodology/Principal findings To investigate the dynamics of triatomine reinfestation in a rural area of the Paraguayan Chaco, genetic characterization (based on 10 microsatellite loci and cytochrome B sequence polymorphisms) was performed on baseline and reinfestant T. infestans (n = 138) from four indigenous communities and adjacent sylvatic sites. House quality and basic economic activities were assessed across the four communities. Significant genetic differentiation was detected among all baseline triatomine populations. Faster reinfestation was observed in the communities with higher infestation rates pre-spraying. Baseline and reinfestant populations from the same communities were not genetically different, but two potentially distinct processes of reinfestation were evident. In Campo Largo, the reinfestant population was likely founded by domestic survivor foci, with reduced genetic diversity relative to the baseline population. However, in 12 de Junio, reinfestant bugs were likely derived from different sources, including survivors from the pre-spraying population and sympatric sylvatic bugs, indicative of gene-flow between these habitats, likely driven by high human mobility and economic activities in adjacent sylvatic areas. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that sylvatic T. infestans threatens vector control strategies, either as a reinfestation source or by providing a temporary refuge during insecticide spraying. Passive anthropogenic importation of T. infestans and active human interactions with neighboring forested areas also played a role in recolonization. Optimization of spraying, integrated community development and close monitoring of sylvatic areas should be considered when implementing vector control activities in the Gran Chaco.",2022,9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/553957670d3a4e7963c311532fa3ec412a431a6b,553957670d3a4e7963c311532fa3ec412a431a6b,"A.

"Characteristics and Adverse Events of Patients for Whom Nifurtimox Was Released Through CDC-Sponsored Investigational New Drug Program for Treatment of Chagas Disease — United States, 2001–2021","Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Chagas disease is endemic in rural areas of Latin America, but T. cruzi, triatomine vectors, infected mammalian reservoir hosts, and rare cases of autochthonous vector borne transmission have been reported in the United States (1). Possible modes of transmission include the following: vector borne via skin or mucosal contact with feces of infected triatomine bugs, congenital, blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or laboratory accident. Chagas disease can be treated with benznidazole (commercially available since May 14, 2018) or nifurtimox (2). Before January 25, 2021, nifurtimox (Lampit) had been exclusively available through CDC under an Institutional Review Board-approved Investigational New Drug (IND) treatment protocol, at which time it became reasonably accessible to health care providers outside of the program. This report summarizes CDC Drug Service reports for selected characteristics of and adverse events reported by 336 patients for whom nifurtimox was requested under the CDC IND program during January 1, 2001-January 25, 2021. Of the 336 patients, 34.2% resided in California. Median age of patients was 37 years (range = 1-78 years). Most patients were aged ≥18 (91.8%; 305 of 332) and Hispanic (93.2%; 290 of 311). Among the patients with available information, 91.4% (222 of 243) reported an adverse event. Among those with information about the severity of their adverse events, 20.5% reported a severe event. On August 7, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced approval of a nifurtimox product, Lampit (Bayer), for treatment of Chagas disease in patients aged <18 years weighing ≥5.5 lbs (≥2.5 kg). Lampit became commercially available during October 2020.

"Multidisciplinary approach detects speciation within the kissing bug Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus populations (Hemiptera, Heteroptera, Reduviidae)","BACKGROUND Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus (Hemiptera-Reduviidae) is a triatomine species with a wide geographic distribution and a broad phenotypic variability. In some countries, this species is found infesting and colonising domiciliary ecotopes representing an epidemiological risk factor as a vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, etiological agent of Chagas disease. In spite of this, little is known about P. rufotuberculatus genetic diversity. METHODS Cytogenetic studies and DNA sequence analyses of one nuclear (ITS-2) and two mitochondrial DNA sequences (cyt b and coI) were carried out in P. rufotuberculatus individuals collected in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico. Moreover, a geometric morphometrics study was applied to Bolivian, Colombian, Ecuadorian and French Guiana samples. OBJECTIVES To explore the genetic and phenetic diversity of P. rufotuberculatus from different countries, combining chromosomal studies, DNA sequence analyses and geometric morphometric comparisons. FINDINGS We found two chromosomal groups differentiated by the number of X chromosomes and the chromosomal position of the ribosomal DNA clusters. In concordance, two main morphometric profiles were detected, clearly separating the Bolivian sample from the other ones. Phylogenetic DNA analyses showed that both chromosomal groups were closely related to each other and clearly separated from the remaining Panstrongylus species. High nucleotide divergence of cyt b and coI fragments were observed among P. rufotuberculatus samples from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico (Kimura 2-parameter distances higher than 9%). MAIN CONCLUSIONS Chromosomal and molecular analyses supported that the two chromosomal groups could represent different closely related species. We propose that Bolivian individuals constitute a new Panstrongylus species, being necessary a detailed morphological study for its formal description. The clear morphometric discrimination based on the wing venation pattern suggests such morphological description might be conclusive.",2022,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64cf98ca6909879bc2fa5578f206989c1c5bc958,64cf98ca6909879bc2fa5578f206989c1c5bc958,"S.

Cytochrome P450 Genes of the CYP4 Clan and Pyrethroid Resistance in Chagas Disease Vectors,"Triatomine insects are vectors of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Although residual pyrethroid spraying has been a successful vector control strategy for many years, a growing number of pyrethroid-resistance foci is being documented, mainly in Triatoma infestans, that led to failures in vector elimination. Insecticide resistance is a multifactorial phenomenon that often implies a combination of three different mechanisms: increased insecticide detoxification, reduced affinity of the site of action, and reduced insecticide penetration through the cuticle. All three mechanisms were reported in pyrethroid-resistant T. infestans. Cytochrome P450s are enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous chemicals. They are encoded by CYP genes and classified into different families and clans. In triatomines, the CYP4 clan is divided in two families, CYP3093 and CYP4, and both exhibit genome-wide, triatomine-specific gene expansions. Some members from each family have been reported to be involved in two of the mechanisms mentioned above, i.e., they participate in insecticide detoxification in different organs and tissues, and in the synthesis of cuticular hydrocarbons, which ultimately can contribute to a reduced insecticide penetration. The aim of this manuscript is to review the current state of knowledge of P450 genes belonging to the CYP4 clan in triatomines and to highlight their potential role in insecticide resistance.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7f3aa63601d7966526cc51a18e25a46430d337ab,7f3aa63601d7966526cc51a18e25a46430d337ab,"A.

Distribution patterns of Triatominae (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in the Americas: an analysis based on networks and endemicity,"Triatominae, commonly known as kissing bugs, are a group of approximately 150 species of hematophagous reduviids, some of which are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of the Chagas disease. Distributional patterns of triatomines have been studied based on macroecological and historical biogeographic approaches, but the definition of distributional patterns and areas of endemism are yet to be defined based on objective criteria. We used two methods to identify biogeographic units in the Triatominae: the endemicity analysis based on an optimality criterion (NDM/VNDM software) and a network approach aimed to simplify and highlight the underlying structure in species distributions (Infomap Bioregions). Information on species distributions was obtained from a data paper, comprising 21 815 records for 135 triatomine species occurring in the Americas. The resulting areas of each method were clustered using a meta consensus criterion based on dissimilarities and interpreted as recurrent areas. The NDM areas show a nested structure, presenting greater restrictions to the inclusion of species in a given area, requiring broad sympatry. In contrast, bioregions emphasize spatial patterns with better‐delimited areas and species occurrences do not need to be highly congruent. When areas were clustered based on their species composition two clear patterns arose from both methods: (i) areas within the southern Amazon and southeast South America, especially in the Chacoan subregion, formed a cluster, and (ii) areas north of the Amazon, Pacific, Mesoamerica, Mexican transition zone and Nearctic formed another cluster. Moreover, within each of these two clusters, there was a latitudinal gradient of the areas in the Americas showing spatial similarity between the areas found in both methods. Results of both methods show well‐bound areas separating the triatomine fauna in the Brazilian subregions, resulting in the recognition of areas corresponding to the biomes Chaco, Pampa, Cerrado, and Caatinga, and, to a lesser extent, the Atlantic Forest.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f990ddd21499a7358bc3e4fe11d65996dd19f941,f990ddd21499a7358bc3e4fe11d65996dd19f941,"A.

Life History Data of Dipetalogaster maxima (Hemiptera: Reduviidae),"Abstract Dipetalogaster maxima (Uhler) is a triatomine species that has been found to be infected by Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas in the habitats of the most important tourist areas of Mexico. Its behavior and vectorial capacity have been scarcely studied, although such information is necessary to reliably estimate the importance of this species as a vector of T. cruzi in its distribution area. This study reports biological parameters related to the vectorial capacity of D. maxima. In particular, the egg-to-adult development time, number of blood meals required to molt, accumulative mortality, time to beginning of feeding, feeding and defecation times, fecundity, and fertility were examined. D. maxima took a median of 211 d to develop from egg to adult, requiring 11 meals in total. Almost two-thirds (63%) of specimens died during the cycle. The time to beginning of feeding was 1 min in all instars. Feeding times varied from 14 to 27 min. Most nymphs (except first-instar) defecated when feeding or immediately thereafter. A mean of 0.7 eggs/♀/day was recorded, with an eclosion rate of 27.3%. Five of the eight studied parameters (mainly defecation delay) suggest the remarkable potential vectorial capacity of D. maxima, so it is necessary to maintain permanent surveillance of domiciliary populations of D. maxima, because they may be infected with T. cruzi.

"Triatoma guazu Lent and Wygodzinsky Is a Junior Synonym of Triatoma williami Galvão, Souza and Lima","Simple Summary Triatomines are blood-sucking insects, potential vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Triatoma guazu and Triatoma williami are phylogenetically very close and occur in sympatry. Morphologic, morphometric, and genetic analyses were performed to discuss the taxonomic status of these species. Morphometric and molecular data do not show diagnostic characteristics between species, whereas their different patterns of connexival spots were considered a phenotypic polymorphism, common in triatomines. These results suggest T. guazu as a junior synonym of T. williami. Therefore, the synonym between these species is formally proposed here. Abstract Triatoma guazu Lent and Wygodzinsky and Triatoma williami Galvão, Souza, and Lima (Hemiptera: Triatominae) are found in human dwellings and are potential vectors of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Triatoma guazu was described based solely on a single female specimen, from the municipality of Villarica, Guairá Department, Paraguay, and posteriorly, a male from Barra do Garças, Mato Grosso, Brazil was described and designated as the allotype of this species. Triatoma williami is found in the central-west of Brazil between Goiás, Mato Grosso, and Mato Grosso do Sul. However, the taxonomic “status” of these species is questioned. Previous studies indicate the lack of isoenzymatic diagnostic loci, morphometric similarity, low genetic divergence, and close evolutionary relationship of these species. In this study, we compared the morphology, morphometry, and mitochondrial DNA fragments of the populations of the two species. The morphological diagnostic characteristic among these species is the difference in the connexivum spots pattern, which has been recognized as a phenotypic variation that exists among populations resulting from ecological diversity. Furthermore, our analysis also revealed the morphometric similarity and low genetic divergence between these species. Therefore, in the present paper, we formally propose T. guazu as a junior synonym of T. williami.",2022,25,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9271b04a911619d881326ff87ce12437233a1cf2,9271b04a911619d881326ff87ce12437233a1cf2,"João Paulo Sales Oliveira Correia, H.

"Collection of triatomines from sylvatic habitats by a Chagas-positive, trained scent-detection canine in Texas, USA","Background Triatomine insects, vectors of the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), are challenging to locate in sylvatic habitats. Collection techniques used in the United States often rely on methods to intercept seasonally dispersing adults or on community scientists’ encounters. Neither method is suited for detecting nidicolous habitats, which is important for vector control. Furthermore, manual inspection of suspected harborages is unlikely to reveal novel locations and host associations. Similar to a team that used a trained dog to detect sylvatic triatomines in Paraguay, we worked with a trained scent detection dog to detect sylvatic locations of triatomines across Texas. Principle methodology/Findings Ziza, a 3-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer previously naturally infected with T. cruzi, was trained to detect triatomines. Over the course of 6 weeks in the fall of 2017, the dog and her handler visited 18 sites across Texas. The dog detected 60 triatomines at 7 locations; an additional 50 triatomines were contemporaneously collected at these sites without the assistance of the dog. Approximately 0.98 triatomines per hour were found when only humans were conducting searches; when working with the dog, approximately 1.71 triatomines per hour were found. In total, 3 adults and 107 nymphs of four species (Triatoma gerstaeckeri, Triatoma protracta, Triatoma sanguisuga, and Triatoma indictiva) were collected. PCR testing of a subset revealed T. cruzi infection, including DTUs TcI and TcIV, in 28% of nymphs (n=100) and 66% of adults (n=3). Blood meal analysis of a subset of triatomines (n=5) revealed feeding on Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus) and eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus). Conclusion/Significance A trained scent detection dog enhanced triatomine detections in sylvatic habitats. This approach is especially effective at detecting triatomine nymphs and nidicolous locations. With new knowledge of specific sylvatic habitats and key hosts fed upon by triatomines, there are opportunities for continued exploration of novel vector control methods to block the transmission of T. cruzi to humans and domestic animals. Author summary Triatomine insects, also known as ‘kissing bugs,’ are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease in humans, dogs, and other mammals. Triatomines are found throughout the Americas, but little is known about where these blood-sucking insects spend their early life stages. Knowing more is important to vector control initiatives aimed at interrupting Chagas disease transmission. Scent detection dogs have been trained to detect many pests, including one study of a triatomine detection dog in South America. In this study, we used a dog to detect triatomines in their natural environments throughout Texas. Over 6 weeks, the dog identified 60 triatomines at 7 different locations; an additional 50 triatomines were collected without the dog’s assistance. Nearly twice as many triatomines were collected per hour when the dog was searching as compared to only humans searching. Of all the triatomine nymphs collected, 28% were positive for T. cruzi, and the blood meal analysis revealed kissing bugs had fed on Southern plains woodrat, opossum, and eastern cottontail. This study outlines a strategy that can be replicated in the United States to enhance the detection and control of habitats where triatomines spend their early life stages.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/81653bf4e4d8fbc558f1477075736402f279760a,81653bf4e4d8fbc558f1477075736402f279760a,"Devin M.

Chagas: The Silent Disease,"Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. An estimated 6 to 7 million people worldwide are infected with T. cruzi. Chagas disease is found mainly in endemic areas of 21 continental Latin American countries, where it is mostly transmitted when humans come into contact with faeces and/or urine of infected blood-sucking triatomine bugs (vector-borne transmission)1. Chagas disease is named after the Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, who discovered the disease in 19092. Trypanosoma cruzi infection is curable if treatment is initiated soon after infection. In chronic patients, antiparasitic treatment can potentially prevent or curb disease progression and prevent transmission. Chagas disease patients are at risk of severe COVID-19 manifestations and should be a priority group to be vaccinated because the SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocarditis and the chronic Chagas disease typically originates a pro-thrombotic status, cardiac alterations and secondary thrombotic strokes3.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ee7df05fa5dabba8ed87573365188af098a50a9,1ee7df05fa5dabba8ed87573365188af098a50a9,Shanees.

"Retrospective study of triatomines in an endemic region for Chagas disease in the state of Bahia, Brazil","Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, which has several forms of transmission. Among them, the vector route requires the constant action of the Health Surveillance in the control of triatomines. Our objective is to describe the diversity of triatomines and the rate of natural infection by T. cruzi in these insects, as well as to analyse entomological indicators, through secondary data generated by the Health Surveillance of the municipality of Barra, in the period from 2009 to 2019. The secondary data were subjected to descriptive analysis and the entomological indicators calculated. Williams’ G test and Fisher’s exact test were used to analyse the categorical data. A total of 10,913 triatomines of the genera Rhodnius sp., Panstrongylus sp., Eratyrus sp. and Triatoma sp. were captured, represented by 12 species. Triatoma sordida was the most prevalent 98.66% (10,767/10,913), reflected in the overall infestation index 7.61% (2,555/33,544) and triatomine density 0.24 (8,247/33,544). While the overall infection rate was 0.81% (41/5,048) and remained low during all years. There was significant association for T. sordida in relation to “T. cruzi infection index” and “Developmental stage” and “Capture site”. It is concluded that the municipality of Barra has a high occurrence of triatomines of various species, with T. sordida being the most prevalent species and responsible for the rates of infestation and infection by T. cruzi. The presence of these insects in households is a risk for the domestic cycle of the parasite, and thus can transmit T. cruzi to various domestic animals, including humans.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46c8a42404d8e25a075ccbf254f569d2030b3d2f,46c8a42404d8e25a075ccbf254f569d2030b3d2f,"Jéssica Samile Sousa Santos, Alini Dias de Pauda, Joane Maíra Cavalcante Braga Novais, Jairo Torres Magalhães Junior, I.

"Different profiles and epidemiological scenarios: past, present and future","The multiplicity of epidemiological scenarios shown by Chagas Disease, derived from multiple transmission routes of the aetiological agent, occurring on multiple geo-ecobiosocial settings determines the complexity of the disease and reveal the difficulties for its control. From the first description of the link between the parasite, the vector and its domestic habitat and the disease that Carlos Chagas made in 1909, the epidemiological scenarios of the American Trypanosomiasis has shown a dynamic increasing complexity. These scenarios changed with time and geography because of new understandings of the disease from multiple studies, because of policies change at the national and international levels and because human movements brought the parasite and vectors to new geographies. Paradigms that seemed solid at a time were broken down, and we learnt about the global dispersion of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, the multiplicity of transmission routes, that the infection can be cured, and that triatomines are not only a health threat in Latin America. We consider the multiple epidemiological scenarios through the different T. cruzi transmission routes, with or without the participation of a Triatominae vector. We then consider the scenario of regions with vectors without the parasite, to finish with the consideration of future prospects.",2022,7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6fa054fae70d4da8b61fb20fb23cb95476c59853,6fa054fae70d4da8b61fb20fb23cb95476c59853,"D.

Chagas Disease Expands Its Epidemiological Frontiers From Rural to Urban Areas,"The infection with the hemoflagellate parasite Trypanosoma cruzi originates from America where the wildlife cycle remains to alternate between mammals and hematophagous triatomines. Transmission through contamination of the bite site by vector feces containing highly infectious forms of parasite or direct ingestion of T. cruzi-infected triatomines appear to be the dominant transmission mechanisms. Man joins the transmission when he enters this wild environment or takes the leaves of palms carrying vectors to build houses. Rural Chagas disease develops associated with populations of low economic resources, with infection and reinfection of vector bites since childhood, and the consequent evolution toward chronic cases in adults, when there is little therapeutic benefit to infected people. The progressive migration of people from rural to urban areas and the adaptation of vectors to the peripheries of cities due to displacement caused by deforestation or urbanization that has favored the presence of enzootic cycles with Panstrongylus geniculatus as the most widely distributed species and mammals (synanthropic and domestic) allow vector transmission by ingestion of food contaminated with excrements containing infectious trypomastigotes as the dominant transmission mechanism in the urban environment. Human-to-human transmissions through vertical mother–child infection, transfusions, organ transplants, and the possibility of sexual transmission, transform the epidemiology and the clinical evolution of Chagas disease in the urban environment. Vectors of American trypanosomiasis are no longer restricted to the endemic area, but its presence has been demonstrated in nonendemic areas of the United States, Asia, and other latitudes. The worldwide plague of bedbugs (Cimex lectularius) threatens the possibility of expansion of transmission since they are vectors susceptible to infection, transmission to mammals, trans-stadial penetration, and not being affected by T. cruzi infection at least experimentally. These factors, added to the presence of an unknown number of migrating Latin American asymptomatic carriers together with the presence of triatomines in other continents, have initiated the globalization of a pathology originating in the American continent.

The time at which feeding started, the span of feeding, the volume of blood consumed, and the time taken to defecate were measured. At 30 days post-feeding, feces were analyzed in parallel by optical microscopy (percentage of metacyclic trypomastigotes, % MT), and qPCR (total T. cruzi DNA). The ratio of parasites consumed/defecated by nymphs of each group was used to estimate the parasites’ survival and multiplication inside the triatomines’ gut. It was estimated that for each blood trypomastigote consumed, 6.6 parasites were obtained in the feces of “R” nymphs, and 7.9 in “S”. “R” nymphs consumed a higher volume of blood, had lower % MT in their feces (lower vectorial competence), and took longer to defecate (lower vectorial capacity) than “S”.",2022,4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d36b352be6650a076c60a5d08ff4abc4f973327f,d36b352be6650a076c60a5d08ff4abc4f973327f,"Andrea Paola Guanuco, C.

"Entomological surveillance of Chagas disease in the East of Minas Gerais region, Brazil.","ABSTRACT Background: After decentralizing the actions of the Chagas Disease Control Program (CDCP) in Brazil, municipalities were now responsible for control measures against this endemic, supervised by the Regional Health Superintendencies (RHS). We aimed to evaluate the recent entomological surveillance of Chagas disease in the Regional Health Superintendence of Governador Valadares (RHS/GV) from 2014 to 2019. Methods: Triatomines captured by residents during entomological surveillance were sent to the reference laboratory, where the species and evolutionary stages were identified, place of capture, and presence of Trypanosoma cruzi. A database was created, and the following were calculated: the rate of infection by T. cruzi (overall rate and rate by species), monthly seasonality, spatial distribution of species, number of captures, and infected triatomines/health microregions. Results: We identified 1,708 insects; 1,506 (88.2%) were triatomines, most were adult instars (n=1,469), and few were nymphs (n=37). The identified species were Triatoma vitticeps, Panstrongylus megistus, Panstrongylus diasi, Rhodnius neglectus, and Panstrongylus geniculatus. The first three were most frequently captured and distributed throughout the study area. Most bugs were captured intradomicile (72.5%), mainly in the second semester, between September and November, with an average infection rate of 41.5% (predominantly T. vitticeps, 49.2%). All municipalities sent triatomines, especially in the microregions of Governador Valadares. Conclusions: These data reinforce the need and importance of improving Chagas disease control measures in the region to establish active and participatory entomological surveillance.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/928581994b55445385d1a9b66db6b64daf952b2e,928581994b55445385d1a9b66db6b64daf952b2e,"Mariana de Almeida Rosa Rezende, M.

"Laboratory Evaluation and Field Feasibility of Micro-Encapsulated Insecticide Effect on Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma dimidiata Mortality in Rural Households in Boyacá, Colombia","Simple Summary Vector control strategies need to adapt due to the increase in insecticide resistance among several vector species. Insecticide spraying requires great economic and logistical efforts due to repeated application every six months. This study evaluated the feasibility of micro-encapsulated insecticide on mortality on Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma dimidiata and its effect on household colonization after one year application in a rural community in Colombia. Findings suggest the ability of this paint to prevent colonization and demonstrated positive population perception. Complementary use of insecticide spraying and micro-encapsulated paints suggest this could be a more efficient public health approach that could reduce costs and logistical efforts. Abstract Chagas disease is a neglected vector-borne zoonosis caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi that is primarily transmitted by insects of the subfamily Triatominae. Although control efforts targeting domestic infestations of Rhodnius prolixus have been largely successful, with several regions in Boyacá department certified free of T. cruzi transmission by intradomicile R. prolixus, novel native species are emerging, increasing the risk of disease. Triatoma dimidiata is the second most important species in Colombia, and conventional control methods seem to be less effective. In this study we evaluated the efficacy and usefulness of micro-encapsulated insecticide paints in laboratory conditions and its applicability in rural communities to avoid triatomine domiciliation. Laboratory conditions measured mortality at 6 months and 12 months, with an average mortality between 93–100% for T. dimidiata and 100% for R. prolixus. Evaluation of triatomine infestation in rural households was measured after one year, with an overall perception of effectiveness in reducing household domiciliation. Although triatomines were still spotted inside and around the homes, our findings demonstrate the ability of micro-encapsulated insecticide to prevent colonization inside the households when comparing infestation rates from previous years. Current control measures suggest insecticide spraying every six months, which implies great economic cost and logistical effort. Complementary triatomine control measures with insecticide spraying and micro-encapsulated insecticide paint would make public health efforts more efficient and reduce the frequency of treatment.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e4f0ad0b3bd4b69476482b62857ba099fd94541,2e4f0ad0b3bd4b69476482b62857ba099fd94541,"Lídia Gual-Gonzalez, M.

"Subregional initiatives for Chagas disease. A path of technical cooperation, opened by the countries, as an approach to a neglected disease","These considerations are made in the sense of contributing to suggest and / or clarify some aspects that are relevant to such an important public health issue in the Region of the Americas, which have been requested by the Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-FIOCRUZ Publication Secretariat. First, we must congratulate the authors for the power of synthesis, which allows us to have an overview of these regional initiatives in the article: “Surveillance and control of Chagas disease in the Americas: regional initiatives and the practical impossibility of interrupting the Trypanosoma cruzi transmission vector”. Initially, it is necessary to clarify that the first Subregional initiative created by the Ministers of Health of the Cone Initiative Sur (INCOSUR) countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile and Paraguay) in 1991 had the following objectives: (i) Elimination of Triatoma infestans from homes and their peridomiciliary areas in endemic and probably endemic areas; (ii) Reduction and elimination of domestic infestations of other species of triatomines that compete in the same areas occupied by T. infestans; (iii) Reduction and elimination of transfusion transmission, by strengthening the effective selection of blood donors from the Network of Blood Banks.",2022,1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a0017d1e72be0a654e7bc33ea9742b88015ce301,a0017d1e72be0a654e7bc33ea9742b88015ce301,J.

"Monitoring Rhodnius neglectus (Lent, 1954) populations’ susceptibility to insecticide used in controlling actions in urban areas northwest of São Paulo state","ABSTRACT Background: Chagas disease (CD) is caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and can be carried by different species of triatomines, including Rhodnius neglectus, which is wild, well distributed in Brazil, and has formed colonies in palm trees located in urban areas of municipalities in the state of São Paulo. Chemical control has been routinely used to reduce population density, but each year, there has been an increase in species dispersion and density. This study aimed to evaluate the susceptibility of insects to insecticides used in control. Methods: The reference population was collected from Araçatuba municipality, Nilce Maia. Dilutions of deltamethrin were prepared and applied to the back of the first-stage nymphs, which were biologically synchronized. The control group received pure acetone only. Mortality was assessed after 72 h. Results: The mortality rate with respect to diagnostic dose was 100%. The susceptibility profile observed for this population showed RR50 ranging from 1.76 to 3.632. Conclusions: The populations were susceptible to the insecticides tested. It is possible that the insecticide residual effect on this ecotope has decreased the lifespan, and controlling failures may be the cause of recolonization in this environment.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c056961863ac4bfaeca43f79e203c157b00f9367,c056961863ac4bfaeca43f79e203c157b00f9367,"R.

Transcriptomics Applied to the Study of Chagas Disease Vectors.,"Chagas disease is a neglected disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, and is transmitted mainly by the feces of contaminated triatomines. Knowledge of the biological, ecological, behavioral, genetic, taxonomic, and systematic aspects of these vectors can contribute to the planning of vector control programs, because all species are considered to be potential vectors of Chagas disease. Transcriptomic studies, in general, provided a new view of the physiology of triatomines (aiding in the knowledge of reproductive aspects of the hematophagy process and even the immune system and the sensory apparatus) and even contributed, as a new tool, to the taxonomy and systematics of these insects. Thus, we conducted a review of the transcriptomic studies on Chagas disease vectors.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9e1dbcc34ea06a02c7c21934e2d869f4ec48097c,9e1dbcc34ea06a02c7c21934e2d869f4ec48097c,"K.

New records of Triatoma huehuetenanguensis in an urban area of Southwest Mexico,"The recently described Triatoma huehuetenanguensis, has been reported in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and Honduras. In Mexico, the species has been collected primarily in rural areas; it has the potential to colonize human dwellings, however, its contribution to Chagas outbreaks remains unclear. In 2021, T. huehuetenanguensis was first observed at Tuxtla Gutierrez city, Chiapas; then a collection for the species was performed. A total of 308 houses were inspected in the intra and peridomestic structures. Only 3 houses (0.97%) were infested. Triatoma huehuetenangensis was the only triatomine specie recorded and four males were collected. None of the bugs tested positive for Trypanosoma infection. We do not have evidence to suggest that urban human-vector contact still limited, and a possible domestication process is possible. The presence of reservoirs, the vector species and the parasite demonstrate that Tuxtla Gutierrez could be at risk of a Chagas disease outbreak.",2022,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/84db90e43284856ed5acde66826bf785344bba9a,84db90e43284856ed5acde66826bf785344bba9a,"Carlos Espinosa-Gonzalez, Eduardo Dávalos-Becerril, Fabián Correa-Morales, Cassandra González-Acosta, Royer López-Bello, J.

"High Parasitic Loads Quantified in Sylvatic Triatoma melanica, a Chagas Disease Vector","Triatoma melanica is a sylvatic vector species in Brazil. In We aimed to characterize the Trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs), the parasitic loads, and the blood meal sources of insects collected in rocky outcrops in rural areas in the state of Minas Gerais. An optical microscope (OM) and kDNA-PCR were used to examine natural infection by T. cruzi, and positive samples were genotyped by conventional multilocus PCR. Quantification of the T. cruzi load was performed using qPCR, and the blood meal sources were identified by Sanger sequencing the 12S rRNA gene. A total of 141 T. melanica were captured. Of these, ~55% (61/111) and ~91% (63/69) were positive by OM and KDNA-PCR, respectively. We genotyped ~89% (56/63) of the T. cruzi-positive triatomines, with TcI (~55%, 31/56) being the most prevalent DTU, followed by TcIII (~20%, 11/56) and TcII (~7%, 4/56). Only TcI+TcIII mixed infections were detected in 10 (~18%) specimens. A wide range of variation in the parasitic loads of T. melanica was observed, with an overall median value of 104 parasites/intestine, with females having higher T. cruzi loads than N2, N4, and N5. TcII showed lower parasitic loads compared to TcI and TcIII. The OM positive diagnosis odds ratio between T. cruzi infection when the parasite load is 107 compared to 103 was approximately 29.1. The most frequent blood meal source was Kerodon rupestris (~58%), followed by Thrichomys apereoides (~18%), Wiedomys cerradensis (~8%), Galactis cuja (~8%) and Gallus gallus (~8%). Our findings characterize biological and epidemiological aspects of the sylvatic population of T. melanica in the study area, highlighting the need to extend surveillance and control to this vector.",2022,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f7f8420f6235b06f65dc96329375056b27d71b93,f7f8420f6235b06f65dc96329375056b27d71b93,"Carolina Valença-Barbosa, Paula Finamore-Araujo, O.

"Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Chemical Control for Chagas Disease Vectors in Loja Province, Ecuador","The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of selective and community-wide house insecticide spraying in controlling triatomines in the subtropical areas of Loja Province, Ecuador. We designed a quasi-experimental pre–post-test without a control group to compare entomological levels before and after spraying. The baseline study was conducted in 2008. Second, third, and fourth visits were conducted in 2010, 2011, and 2012 in three rural communities. Out of the 130 domestic units (DU) visited, 41 domestic units were examined in each of the four visits. Selective and community-wide insecticide interventions included spraying with 5% deltamethrin at 25 mg/m2 active ingredient. At each visit, a questionnaire was administered to identify the characteristics of households, and DUs were searched for triatomine bugs. In addition, parasitological analysis was carried out in life triatomines. One and two rounds of selective insecticide spraying decreased the probability of infestation by 62% (pairwise odds ratios [POR] 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17–0.89, p = 0.024) and 51% (POR 0.49, 95% CI 0.23–1.01, p = 0.054), respectively. A similar effect was observed after one round of community-wide insecticide application in Chaquizhca and Guara (POR 0.55, CI 0.24–1.25, p = 0.155) and Bellamaria (POR 0.62, CI 0.22–1.79, p = 0.379); however, it was not statistically significant. Trypanosoma cruzi infection in triatomines (n = 483) increased overtime, from 2008 (42.9% and 8.5% for Rhodnius ecuadoriensis and Panstrongylus chinai, respectively) to 2012 (79.5% and 100%). Neither of the two spraying methodologies was effective for triatomine control in this area and our results point to a high likelihood of reinfestation after insecticide application. This underscores the importance of the implementation of physical barriers that prevent invasion and colonization of triatomines in households, such as home improvement initiatives, accompanied by a concerted effort to address the underlying socioeconomic issues that keep this population at risk of developing Chagas disease.",2022,5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7e1b22c52eff2b1e71f67ebd9d004ac61e0c8d86,7e1b22c52eff2b1e71f67ebd9d004ac61e0c8d86,"M.
