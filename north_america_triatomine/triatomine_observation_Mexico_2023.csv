"Identification of a triatomine infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in an urban area of the state of Veracruz, Mexico: A comprehensive study","Chagas disease, considered a neglected disease, was initially confined to rural localities in endemic areas; however, in recent years through the process of urbanization and migration of infected people, the disease is gaining importance in urban environments. The presence of the vector in urban areas in most cases is due to the passive transport of vectors, but recently, its presence seems to be linked to vector adaptation processes associated with climate change. This paper reports the occurrence of an infected triatomine in the peridomicile of a house in an urban area of Córdoba, Veracruz, Mexico, where the species found is described, the molecular characteristics and resistance to BZN and NFX of the Trypanosoma cruzi isolate obtained, as well as serological data of the dwelling inhabitants. These urban disease scenarios make it possible to generate new scientific knowledge and enable the creation of new control strategies for Chagas disease vectors.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d5e1a6694ace87a189e007c4139f19f39f3546b,3d5e1a6694ace87a189e007c4139f19f39f3546b,"Ochoa-Martínez Paulina, López-Monteon Aracely, López-Domínguez Jaime, Torres-Montero Jesús, Domínguez-Guillén Jorge Alberto, Ramos-Ligonio Angel"
"New Records of Triatomine: Triatoma rubida and T. sinaloensis at Sonora, Northwestern Mexico","Abstract. To update a list of arthropod group-species, including triatomines, in the State of Sonora, northwestern Mexico, entomological surveys were done during the spring of 2022 in conserved areas of the state. Triatomines Triatoma rubida (Uhler) and T. sinaloensis Ryckman (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) were found living in nests of woodrats, Neotoma sp., and California roadrunners, Geococcyx californianus (Lesson). Because T. rubida is one of the main vectors of Chagas disease in North America, and T. sinaloensis has been found naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, surveillance of the species should be essential for Chagas disease control programs in northwestern Mexico.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e054bbba65d8e23aed661388f95226fe86e25d4,3e054bbba65d8e23aed661388f95226fe86e25d4,"Antonio A.

"Chagas Disease, a Triatomine Bug-Transmitted Protozoan Infection","Chagas disease is a potentially fatal, chronic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan parasite. It causes 6 to 8 million cases and 50,000 deaths each year. Humans and animals usually become infected with T. cruzi via triatomine bugs, also called kissing or conenose bugs, found only in the Americas. Disease transmitted by triatomine bugs generally occurs in rural areas of Mexico, Central America, and South America, but it is becoming more prevalent in non-endemic areas like the US as asymptomatic infected people move from rural to urban areas of Latin America and other regions.  In the US, approximately 300,000 people are currently infected with Chagas disease, 18,000 in Florida. Most if not all of them were infected elsewhere; local transmission of Chagas disease via triatomines in the US is rare. Awareness and understanding of Chagas disease are critical to detect and treat cases early. This publication is intended for anyone interested in learning more about Chagas disease.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c936b4ef3fd874af4ee71427408b470a8c35ba9b,c936b4ef3fd874af4ee71427408b470a8c35ba9b,"Bethany R.

The distribution of triatomine (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in Illinois and Missouri: historical records and specimen submissions from community science programs.,"Triatomine species (kissing bugs) infected with Trypanosoma cruzi are found across the southern United States. The northern limits of Trypanosoma cruzi infected kissing bugs are less understood. The objective of this work was to describe the locations of kissing bugs from Illinois and Missouri based on historical records, submissions to Texas A&M University's (TAMU) Kissing Bug Community Science Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and records from online platforms (iNaturalist, BugGuide, and GBIF) up to and including 2022. A total of 228 records were discovered, including 186 from historical or observation platforms and 42 specimens submitted to TAMU or CDC. Species included Triatoma sanguisuga (221 total records, 9 nymphs) and Triatoma lecticularia (7 records). Notably, nearly all (24/26) records submitted to TAMU were collected indoors. Twelve of the 30 (40%) specimens tested were positive for the presence of T. cruzi, including parasite discrete taxonomic units TcI and TcIV. One triatomine sample had been found in a bed feeding on the submitter; this bug was positive for T. cruzi and had evidence of human blood in its gut. Records suggest a ubiquitous distribution in Missouri and potentially to the northernmost border in Illinois. Further investigations into triatomine distribution and infection status are needed within states assumed to be northern limits in order to create public health and veterinary health messaging and baseline distributional maps from which to measure future range shifts in relation to a changing climate.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26c765439f3ffb2a1f84d0a00d82100d54b09b8f,26c765439f3ffb2a1f84d0a00d82100d54b09b8f,"Ellen M.

"First Report of Eratyrus cuspidatus (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) Infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in Peridomestic Environment in Chiapas, Mexico.","Background: Triatomine bugs are natural vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis. The role of sylvatic triatomine species as vectors of T. cruzi in Mexico remains to be fully understood. Our research on the epidemiology of Chagas disease in Southeastern Mexico involved sampling triatomines in rural settings. Materials and Methods: A triatomine was collected in a peridomestic environment of a rural dwelling in the state of Chiapas. The triatomine was identified morphologically as an adult female Eratyrus cuspidatus Stal. Results: Microscopic analysis revealed flagellate forms of T. cruzi in the feces of the E. cuspidatus collected. This was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Amplification of the mini-exon gene showed that the T. cruzi infecting E. cuspidatus corresponded to lineage I. Conclusions: This is the first report from Mexico of E. cuspidatus found infected in a human dwelling, which represents an important adaptation process to inhabit human environments.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/200bcf413427bf401239ce932ccb56b8dbdc05ec,200bcf413427bf401239ce932ccb56b8dbdc05ec,"D.

Infection with Trypanosoma Cruzi Chagas and Characterization of Human Habitats of Triatoma Picturata (Usinger) in Western Mexico,"ABSTRACT: Chagas disease is one of the most important vector-borne diseases in Latin America. Triatoma picturata (Usinger), distributed in western Mexico, is one of the most important vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas. Knowing the type and materials used for building homes could lead to improved methods for controlling triatomines by focusing efforts on controlling every species of triatomine in its specific microhabitat. Houses in three studied localities of western Mexico that harbored T. picturata were characterized, as well as two entomological indices. Infestation Index values varied from 10.8% to 51.9% in the three localities, whereas Natural Infection Index values varied from 18.1% to 35.2%. Characteristics of houses invaded by T. picturata also varied. In Juan Gil Preciado, with the highest Entomological Index values, most houses were built of adobe walls with a roof of clay tiles and a dirt floor, and included the presence of domestic animals. Our data indicate that the potential risk of infection with T. cruzi differs markedly for inhabitants of the three studied localities, which demonstrates the importance of studying local populations of triatomines. Our study should contribute to decision-making regarding triatomine control efforts by providing profiles of houses that are more susceptible to triatomine invasion.",2023,0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b192815a59d10c225cece8523d79d11044d83e1b,b192815a59d10c225cece8523d79d11044d83e1b,"T.

"Triatoma pallidipennis (Stål, 1872) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) and its potential for infestation in Tecozautla, Hidalgo state, Mexico","ABSTRACT: Triatoma pallidipennis is an exclusive and widely distributed species in Mexico and one of the three main vectors that transmit Chagas disease in the country. The state of Hidalgo is an endemic area for Chagas disease where the presence of several species of triatomines has been reported. The objective of our work was to describe the morphology, colonization process, and reproductive behavior of T. pallidipennis in Guadalupe, Tecozautla, two years after the first collection of a specimen in this region. A total of 28 specimens was collected at both domicile and peridomicile, showing a 17.8% infection rate. The main collection site was a woodshed, and despite the collection of adults in the dwelling, we did not find eggs, exuviae, or nymphs. One female monitored from collection day until death laid 566 eggs, with a hatching rate of 95%, showing an increase of oviposition when cohabited with a male. The results showed the capacity that T. pallidipennis has to infest areas (mainly human dwellings) when it settles down, which would imply a risk for the population that lives in the locality.",2023,2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03f815a4b3e192498f166ff913db2aef9a0985f9,03f815a4b3e192498f166ff913db2aef9a0985f9,"R.
